AB  - The nutritional benefits of fish and fish oils have resulted in an increasing interest in seafoods and derived products generally focused on the level of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (FAs). In particular 20:5 n-3 (EPA) and 22:6 n-3 (DHA) are believed to play a natural, preventive role in cardiovascular diseases, and alleviation of other health problems [1,2]. Aquaculture opens up interesting possibilities for exerting a control over factors affecting the nutritional and sensory attributes of fish as food such as the quantitative and qualitative content of fat in the edible tissues. About 20% of the muscle lipids of farmed Atlantic salmon are n-3 FAs, with some variation due to the FA composition of the fish feed. The content of EPA and DHA in muscle of farmed Atlantic salmon has been found to be approximately 0.6 and 0.8 g/100 g of fillet, respectively [3]. Traditionally, gas chromatography (GC) has been used to obtain the FAs profile of lipids. This technique requires that the sample is pretreated, extraction and methylation of the lipids have to be included as part of the analysis [3]. Recently it has been demonstrated that high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to provide insight into the nature of lipid mixtures and offers the opportunity to study hetereogeneous lipid mixtures, oils and fat deposits without being destructive [4–7]. NMR measurements can be performed on intact muscle and allows the identification and quantification of muscle metabolites [4,7,8] addition to lipid fluidity studies in fish muscle stored at low temperatures [9]. In preliminary studies 13C NMR has been used to obtain the n-3 FA content of intact fish muscle [7,10]. The 13C NMR experiment on intact muscle is very time consuming and it would be an advantage to detect on 1H instead of 13C due to the facts that 1H NMR has the highest NMR sensitivity of any stable nucleus, and it has nearly 100% natural abundance. In our preliminary research it has been shown that high-resolution 1H NMR is a unique and rapid technique to quantify the total n-3 acid content of the lipid extracted from muscle of Atlantic salmon [5,7]. A traditional 1H spectrum of intact muscle will only result in broad signals containing fat/water proton resonances and individual FAs or groups of lipids are not observed. However, recent research indicates that magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy offers the opportunity to study intact tissue non-destructively to quantify components of the tissues. Ni and Eads [11,12] have studied fruit tissue and they have shown that low-speed MAS simultaneously relieves susceptibility broadening, improves resolution, produces accurate chemical shifts, and increases signal-to-noise ratio. In the present study, we have obtained 1H MAS NMR spectra of intact salmon muscle and quantified the total n-3 acid content from the spectra. The data from the MAS NMR analyses were compared to those obtained by estimating the fat content in extracts from equivalent muscle samples by 1H NMR and by GC. The results from MAS NMR and from 1H NMR were usually in good agreement, while the content of n-3 estimated by GC was in general higher than if estimated by the NMR techniques.

AB  - Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a known mediator of immunity, but the regulatory function of its exogenous form is not well understood in fish particularly in the mucosa. Here we report transcriptomic changes in the nasal leukocytes of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) following exposure to two forms of H2S donors – the salt sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and the organic analogue morpholin-4-ium 4-methoxyphenyl (morpholino) phosphinodithioate (GYY4137). Nasal leukocytes were exposed to three concentrations (1, 10 and 100 μM) of either of the two H2S forms for 24 h before the cells were checked for viability and collected for microarray analysis. Though cellular viability was minimally affected by the exposure to two H2S donors, GYY4137-exposed cells exhibited reduced viability compared with the NaHS group at the highest dose. The H2S-induced transcriptomic changes in the nasal leukocytes were concentration-dependent regardless of the sulphide forms. However, a larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the NaHS-exposed versus GYY4137-exposed groups across concentrations. In all comparisons, at least 53% of the DEGs identified were significantly upregulated. Gene ontology (GO) terms enriched in the lists of upregulated DEGs at higher concentrations included ferric iron binding. A comparison of the two H2S forms showed a clear grouping of different GO terms relative to concentrations. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed a significant influence in VEGF ligand-receptor interactions, oxidative stress, innate and adaptive immunity, and interleukin signalling especially at higher concentrations. Congruence analysis demonstrated that there were 16 GO terms overlapping; of these, 12 were upregulated by both sulphide donors including several involving iron binding and transport. The study offers the first molecular insights into how fish nasal leukocytes respond to exogenous H2S, and the results will be vital in resolving the regulatory function of H2S on mucosal immunity in fish.

AB  - An assumption in aquaculture of Atlantic salmon is that male and female growth within families is perfectly genetically correlated. That is, families would rank identically if based on male growth only or female growth only. Also, growth in freshwater and sea water is assumed to be highly correlated between males and females within families. However, structural analysis of the DNA of Atlantic salmon has found that the linkage maps of females differ significantly from that of males. Genetic variability for any trait measured on females could be greater or lesser than on males. Thus, male and female growth might be considered as separate traits giving rise to families ranking differently depending on gender. A multiple trait family model for weight and length at 3 years of age in Atlantic salmon according to gender was applied to data on North American Atlantic salmon obtained from the Oak Bay Hatchery in New Brunswick, Canada. Genetic correlations between male and female growth in both freshwater and sea water were estimated by Bayesian methods. The estimates support the possible existence of gender dimorphism in North American Atlantic salmon for growth traits.

AB  - Pancreas disease (PD) is an emerging disease in salmon farming caused by the salmonid alphavirus (SAV). SAV is evidently spread horizontally between neighbouring salmon farms, but whether such transmission occurs by passive drift in the water current or via fomites is not known. We tested whether hydrodynamic modelling contributes to explain the spread of PD, in which case SAV is likely to spread by passive drift. We present a simple logistic regression model that accounts for the effect of PD in the neighbourhood on the probability of acquiring PD in cohorts of farmed salmonids from an area on the west coast of Norway between 2005 and 2008. For a given cohort, we calculated infection pressure (IP) based on Euclidean distance, seaway distance or estimated water contact to sites with PD, and compared the amount of variance explained in the regression model by the differ- ent variants of IP. Water contact between a discharging farm site and a receiving site was calculated by simulating particle discharge using a hydrodynamic model. IP estimated by water contact was the best predictor of PD cases and controls in the model, which performed significantly better than IP estimated by seaway distance or Euclidean distance. Since the spread of PD in the study area was best explained by modelled water velocity, we conclude that PD is likely to be spread by passive drift of SAV in the water current.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Genetic improvement is key to the development of a more efficient aquaculture industry. By 2010, there were 104 breeding programmes for aquaculture species in the world, most of them for fish species. Usually, the breeding goals include traits such as growth rate, disease resistance, maturation and carcass quality. Resistance to specific pathogens has been one of the main objectives of research and development in the genetic improvement programmes of salmonids in Chile and worldwide. In Chile, trait selection has been conducted through the application of selection indexes. New technologies like next generation sequencing and genotyping have helped disentangle the genetic basis and enhance genetic evaluation methods of economically important traits. This work aims to review the advances in genetic improvement for salmon and trout aquaculture with emphasis on the Chilean experience. We focus on the implementation of breeding programmes in the country, definition of breeding objectives, results on genetic parameters and response to selection and incorporation of genomics. Future challenges and opportunities regarding genotype‐by‐environment interactions, climate change and research and development, plus the demonstration of the economic benefit of breeding programmes are also addressed.</jats:p>

AB  - There have been many reports on the presence of nitrosamines in foods, but the methods of extraction and identification have not always been adequate and some of the results have been conflicting. The authors tried to detect nitrosamines in 149 samples of Japanese commercial food, and dimethylnitrosamine (DMNA) and diethylnitrosamine (DENA) could be identified in 15 samples.Extraction was carried out by modified procedure of Howard method and identified by thin-layer chromatography. Recovery of extraction of DMNA from foods by the above modified method was 50-60% and the detection limit on TLC plate was 0.2μg of DMNA with ninhydrin.DMNA was detected in 6 among 20 samples of the pressed ham, which materials were pork, whale and (or) tuna meat, and also detected in 1 sample among 3 samples of hamburger consisted of pork and whale meat. Although DMNA and DENA were detected in 7 among 20 samples of salted salmon roe in which sodium nitrite was used as a color fixative, these contents were trace. The amounts of DMNA in the pressed ham could not be exactly determined by TLC method, but from the detection limit on the plate the contents were presumed to approximately as 15-25ppb.In salted cod roe purchased in markets, no nitrosamines were detected, but nitrite-treated cod roes which were processed in our laboratory showed over 1 ppm of DMNA and DENA contents. This fact indicates that the addition of nitrite to secondary amine-rich foods, such as fishes, fish roes or whale meat may be possible hazard to human health.

AB  - Little is known about how escaped farmed Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. affect the envi- ronment, but the potential for negative ecological consequences might be significant. In this study, the movements of adult farmed north-east Arctic cod (NEAC) and Norwegian coastal cod (NCC) were mapped after a simulated escape from an aquaculture farm to evaluate if post-escape move- ments and potential for recapture differs between these 2 genotypes. There was no major difference between NEAC and NCC equipped with acoustic transmitters with respect to spatiotemporal distri- bution or swimming depth during a 10 wk period after simulated escape incidents. The tagged cod immediately descended to average depths <20 m, and subsequently were most frequently observed along the shore. A substantial proportion of the farmed cod released at the cod farm left within the first week, while cod released at a nearby mussel farm were attracted to the cod farm. Beyond Week 2, the fish detected at the cod farm consisted of approximately similar proportions of fish released at either the mussel or cod farm. One third of the tagged cod was recaptured in local small- scale commercial and recreational fisheries during the first 3 wk after release. Thus, our results indicate that organised recapture fishery is a realistic option for reducing possible ecological and genetic impacts of escaped farmed cod. Such fishery must, however, be initiated as soon as possible after an escape incident and there is a need for development of a methodology for rapid detection and efficient recapture of escapees.

While in situ net cleaning is effective there is uncertainty as to whether the equipment or dispersed material has an impact upon the fish in the cages. Through direct contact with the environment, the significant surface area of the gill including its microbiome is directly exposed to the acute environmental changes generated by net cleaning.

AB  - The growth dynamics of six different Swedish stocks (Arjeplog, Arevattnet, Bergnas, Bathalla, Granbo. Gullspang) of landlocked brown trout were compared. The fish were kept in 1-m2 troughs from start of feeding in spring 1988 until September 1989. Thereafter the stocks were reared together in 4-m2 troughs until the termination of the experiment in October 1990. After the first summer of growth, Bergnas trout had the highest mean weight and Granbo and Bathalla trout the lowest. In September 1989 the ranking of stocks with respect to mean weight had not changed. During the rest of the experiment, i.e. when stocks were reared together, Arevattnet trout increased in weight most rapidly and reached the highest final mean weight. Bergnas trout grew very slowly after the stocks had been merged. Granbo and Bathalla trout ended up with the lowest mean weights. Sexual maturation in 1 + males was very rare. Gullspang trout had the highest proportion (42%) of mature 2+ males, while Granbo trout had the lowest proportion (4%). With the exception of Gullspang trout, mature males generally had a higher mean weight than immature fish. The experiment revealed considerable differences in overall growth, even between stocks with similar life histories in nature. Hatching time, frequency of sexual maturation and hatchery selection were identified as potential mechanisms behind the observed differences. In all, stock differences in important traits for commercial aquaculture are considerable, which makes further stock comparisons necessary before the start of breeding programmes.

AB  - Excess phosphorus (P) in freshwater ecosystems increases primary production which, left uncontrolled, may lead to eutrophication, accelerating the ageing process of receiving water bodies. To limit phosphorus release resulting from freshwater aquaculture, we propose to incorporate microencapsulated P-chelating agents into fish diets. In a first trial, alum (Al2SO4) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) were encapsulated by spray-chilling in a hydrogenated lipid matrix. Two practical diets incorporating one of these two chelating elements (6 g/kg) were fed to fish for five weeks (w), and P release from resulting feces was compared. In a second trial, a similar approach was used to evaluate the impact of increasing supplementation of encapsulated alum (3, 6, 15 g/kg of diet). Feces from the fish fed with the diets incorporating alum and ferrous sulfate released 62 % and 54 % respectively less P than feces from fish fed with control diets. The second experiment revealed a negative correlation between the level of encapsulated Al2SO4 included in the diet and phosphorus released by the feces (y = 0.18x2 ˗ 4.78x + 62.7; R2 = 0.93). Feces from feed incorporating Al2SO4 at 0, 3, 6 and 15 g/kg released 62 %, 52 %, 39 %, and 32 % of the total fecal P after 14 days respectively. Fish fed encapsulated Al2SO4 have similar growth performance and mineral status. Incorporation of encapsulated P-chelating agents into fish feed offers an opportunity to manage P release from fish feces. Long-term feeding studies are required for validation of dietary Al2SO4 and FeSO4 impacts on potential toxicity and growth/environmental performance following chronic feeding of encapulated P chelating agents.

AB  - South Chilean fjords contain an astonishing diverse benthic macrofauna of which anthozoans form a major portion. Azooxanthellate solitary scleractinians, which were hitherto known from major depths, were found as shallow as 8 m during several expeditions to the south Chilean fjord region. At some sites, stony corals dominate the macrofauna and form dense aggregations, which may cover several 10’s of square meters in depths below 25 m. The discovery of these communities in shallow water for the first time allows for in situ observations and structural analysis of these populations by means of SCUBA diving. For further studies, living and dead corals were sampled, photographed, and dried for preservation. Several specimens and tissue samples were preserved in 96% ethanol. The sampled specimens were identified as Desmophyllum dianthus (Esper, 1794) and Caryophyllia Lamarck, 1801 spec. nov. Specimens of D. dianthus found on a shipwreck allowed for growth rate estimations. Minimum growth rates were estimated as 2.3 mm longitudinal growth per year and 1.6 mm diameter growth. Due to increasing human impact on benthic communities in Chilean fjords, especially through salmon farming, it cannot be excluded that these coral communities are in danger before they are even studied.

AB  - The production of farmed salmonids in Chile reached 550 000 t in 2004. The industry is considered to be consolidated, but with potential for further expansion to the south into pristine coastal areas. The environmental impacts of the salmonid farming industry in Chile were reviewed in 1996, and evidence at that time did not suggest significant adverse effects. However, after almost ten years of sustained growth, current evidence indicates that significant loss of benthic biodiversity and localized changes in the physico-chemical properties of sediments have occurred in areas with salmonid farms. Furthermore, the presence of these farms significantly increases in pulses the density of dinoflagellates. Data suggest that escaped farmed fish may have an impact on native species, although their survival in the wild appears low. The abundance of omnivorous diving and carrion-feeding marine birds increased from twofold to fivefold in areas with salmon farms compared with control areas without them. It is urgent that an ecosystem approach be implemented to assess all impacts of salmonid farming on coastal ecosystems in southern Chile.

AB  - Multilocus heterozygosity, aggressive and feeding behaviour, plasma cortisol levels and growth rate were evaluated among three groups of juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha: diploid, triploid and mixed groups of diploid and triploid fish. There was no difference between diploid and triploid fish in measurements of heterozygosity calculated using seven microsatellite loci, and these measurements did not correlate with performance measurements including feeding rate and growth rate. Aggression trials that examined small groups of fish revealed that after 4 days together in tanks, triploid fish were significantly less aggressive during feeding than diploid fish or fish in mixed groups. At the end of the trials, however, plasma cortisol levels did not differ among the three groups. Thirty-day growth trials in duplicate tanks of 60 fish revealed no difference in growth rate among diploid, triploid and mixed groups, but plasma cortisol levels were significantly lower in triploid fish than in either diploid fish or the mixed fish. Overall, independent of the above differences in aggressive behaviour and cortisol levels, these results suggest similar performance in diploid and triploid Chinook salmon, and thus provide support for the viability of triploid Chinook salmon culture in commercial aquaculture.

AB  - Anaesthetic drugs are commonly administered to fish in aquaculture, research and veterinary contexts. Anaesthesia causes temporary absence of consciousness and may reduce the stress and/or pain associated with handling and certain invasive procedures. The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a widely-used model species with relevance to both aquaculture and natural ecosystems. This study sought to establish the relative acute impact of commonly used anaesthetics on rainbow trout when used for anaesthesia or euthanasia by exploring their effects on aversion behaviour and stress physiology. Five widely used anaesthetics were investigated at two concentrations reflective of common laboratory practises: MS-222, benzocaine, 2-phenoxyethanol, etomidate and eugenol. The anaesthetics were administered via immersion and fish were: 1) euthanised with anaesthetic; or 2) allowed to recover from deep plane anaesthesia; or 3) subjected to a conditioned place avoidance paradigm. Behaviour, opercular beat rate and plasma cortisol concentrations and cortisol release rates to water were quantified to investigate the effects of the five drugs. Based upon longer induction to deep plane anaesthesia, and increased plasma cortisol levels post-anaesthesia the widely-used and recommended anaesthetic MS-222 may be relatively stressful for rainbow trout. Whereas 2-phenoxyethanol, due to a combination of quicker induction, reduced aversive behavioural response during anaesthesia and lower post-anaesthesia plasma cortisol levels may be a more advisable alternative. It is crucial for the welfare of fish that the use of anaesthetics is as humane as possible and thus these findings have important implications for the welfare and husbandry of captive rainbow trout.

AB  - Brown trout and young Atlantic salmon in streams are selective in their habitat use, which is partially determined by hydro-physical conditions. Habitat selection may be quantified in models and combined with hydraulic models to evaluate instream habitat suitability. Fish occupancy of habitat depends on the fish species and size. Brown trout prefer deep stream areas with moderate to low water velocities and rocky substrates, whereas young Atlantic salmon chose more fast flowing and often shallower areas. Habitat selection has been quantified in static selection models which should be based on measures of habitat usage and availability (preferences) and combined with data on hydro-physical conditions to build predictive habitat hydraulic models. Such models assess habitat availability and capacity rather than discharge–biomass relationships. Limitations of static models in fish habitat studies are (1) the relevant hydro-physical variables are not included, (2) the interaction terms are difficult to quantify and not incorporated, (3) the hydraulic models may not operate on a spatial scale that is relevant to fish, (4) the models include spatial but only to a limited extent temporal heterogeneity in habitat conditions and (5) biotic factors are not included. Streams may be extremely heterogeneous ecosystems, both spatially and temporally, which may influence habitat selection and modelling. In response to varying habitat availabilities (stream size and structure, water flows) habitat selection in brown trout and young Atlantic salmon is dynamic and relatively flexible. Furthermore, changes in temperature may result in seasonal and daily niche shifts. Therefore unless the dynamic aspects of habitat selection are incorporated into the habitat models, long-term predictive power in habitat–hydraulic modelling is unlikely. However, habitat–hydraulic modelling is a useful tool in a 'no net loss of habitat' management strategy regardless of these shortcomings. References Alexander, G. R. and Hansen, E. A. 1983.

AB  - Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were stocked at 3,700, 6,200, and 8,650 fish per hectare on November 16, 1977, in standing-water ponds at Auburn, Alabama. Each treatment was replicated four times. Fish were fed daily with commercial, floating trout feed. Average net production values, in order of increasing stocking rates, were 700, 1,130, and 1,640 kg/hectare at harvest on March 16, 1978. Feed conversion values (weight feed ÷ net production) ranged from 1.15 to 1.27. The winter was cooler than normal and water temperatures never exceeded 19 C (average, 9 C). Feed consumption by rainbow trout is reduced at water temperatures below 10 C. Other water quality variables were within desirable ranges for rainbow trout. Concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) at dawn were closely correlated with water temperatures. Nighttime DO budgets for ponds indicated that DO dynamics were dominated by diffusion.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Giant freshwater prawn (GFP), <jats:italic>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</jats:italic>, is a tropical species widely cultured in several countries across the world. It has high market demand accompanied by attractive prices. The global farmed production of this species in 2018 was 237,124 tonnes (t) valued over 1.93 billion USD. Due to its importance in freshwater aquaculture, several countries have started genetic improvement programmes for this species with varying degree of success. The selective breeding programmes for <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>rosenbergii</jats:italic> were started rather late (in the mid‐nineties) compared with other aquaculture species such as salmon (1975), tilapia (1986) and rohu carp (1992). At present, genetic improvement programmes with this species are continuing in Vietnam, China, India, Thailand and Indonesia. In the majority of the breeding programmes, the major selection trait is growth rate. The heritability of growth rate (harvest body weight; HBW) ranged from 0.056 to 0.407. In most of the programmes, response to selection was moderate to high ranging from 4.4% to 11% per generation. Selection for faster growth has also brought correlated response of higher edible meat without detrimental effects on flesh quality attributes. There was low response per generation (1.1% per generation) in survival rate. The present paper reviews the selective breeding programmes for GFP being carried out in different countries with a focus on experiences gained and the problems faced in disseminating the improved strain. The challenges faced during the conduct and practical implementation of breeding programmes are discussed, and we outline research areas that could lead to improved productivity in this species.</jats:p>

AB  - Movements of 20 radio-tagged wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr were studied 1.3 km downstream of a hydropower station. Ten parr were free-ranging and ten were restricted to an area near the river bank by a 75 m2 rectangular containment pen that was flooded at high flow, but dry at low flow except for a small refuge at the low end. The positions of contained parr were continuously recorded within a four-cell uniform grid by continuous data logging, while free-ranging fish were positioned by manual tracking four times per day. River discharge was manipulated to run five pseudo-replicated series of three step changes from 30 to 70 to 110 m3 s−1, with slow (2 h) and rapid (0 h) increase and decrease in discharge, as well as during day and night. No differences in movements or home ranges (mean 2770 m2 ± 1759 SD) were detected related to manipulated discharge variations or time of day or night for the free-ranging parr. No free-ranging parr were stranded during rapid flow reductions. In the containment pen, the parr distributed themselves relatively evenly among the cells. They moved significantly more at changing than at stable flows. In the containment pen, most of the fish that were stranded were observed during rapid flow reductions at night. Rapid reductions in water flow may cause increased mortality in large parr in shallow habitats if movements are restricted; however, rapid fluctuations did not appear to influence movements or cause stranding by free-ranging Atlantic salmon parr, which moved considerable distances regardless of discharge.

AB  - Flavobacterium psychrophilum is a pathogen causing bacterial coldwater disease in salmonid hatcheries worldwide. This study evaluated the feeding of four commercial diets to rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss at a hatchery with endemic bacterial coldwater disease in three sequential feed trials, beginning at 28 days after initial feeding and lasting for a total duration of 83 days. Two Bio-Oregon (Longview, Washington, USA) diets, Bio-Vita and BioPro2, and two Skretting (Toele, Utah, USA) diets, Classic Trout and Protec, were used. While the overall mortality rates were the same among all the diets, there were differences in the timing at which the mortality occurred. Significant differences in tank ending weight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio only occurred in the third and final trial, with the Classic Trout diet producing the poorest results. Overall results, with all of the trials combined, indicated tanks receiving the Bio-Vita and BioPro2 diets had significantly higher weight gain than tanks receiving Classic Trout. Additionally, feed conversion ratios were significantly elevated in the Classic Trout treatment group compared to the other three dietary treatments. With few impacts on overall mortality among all diets tested, the faster growth obtained from the Bio-Oregon diets may lead to more rapid development of acquired immunity with possible implications for bacterial coldwater disease management beyond the duration of this study.

AB  - Polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) analysis was used to identify meat from biwa trout (Oncorhynchus masou rhodurus), amago trout (Oncorhynchus masou ishikawae), yamame trout (Oncorhynchus masou masou), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). PCR amplification was conducted using primers flanking conserved regions of NADH dehydrogenase subunits 4 and 5 (ND4–ND5) (2848 bp) and ND1 (1091 bp) genes of mitochondrial DNA following restriction digestion with the enzyme HaeIII. Although the segments of ND4–ND5 and ND1 genes showed intraspecies variation, the generation of DNA fragments larger than 300 bp and 160 bp following cleavage by HaeIII of ND4–ND5 and ND1, respectively, was efficient to differentiate the four species. Furthermore, this method was successful in species identification even when using PCR-amplified products obtained from thermally processed biwa trout samples. This sensitive technique can be utilized to reveal commercial fraud, where biwa trout is adulterated with meat from cheaper counterparts.

AB  - The potential for metals to bioaccumulate in aquatic species, such as fish, via trophic level transfer was investigated. An in vivo experiment was set up in a flow-through system in which juvenile rainbow trout were fed blue mussels collected from a Class A pristine site and an effluent-impacted river estuary, over a period of 28 days. Selected elements (As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, Sn, V, Zn) were determined in the mussels and fish tissues (muscle and skin) collected at 0, 14 and 28 days. This study reveals the occurrence of metals in mussels sampled in the Irish marine environment and highlights the bioaccumulation potential of metals in fish tissues via trophic transfer. All 14 monitored metals were determined in the mussels collected from both sites and mussels collected from the effluent-impacted site contained three times more Co, Mo, Sn and V than the mussels collected from the Class A site. Following a 28-day dietary exposure, concentrations of As and Se (fish muscle), and Pb, Se and Zn (fish skin), were significantly greater in fish feeding on contaminated mussels compared to those with a regular fish feed diet. The significance of metal detection and bioaccumulation in the mussel and fish tissues, highlights the potential for metal exposure to humans through the food chain. As fish are recommended as a healthy and nutritious food source, it is important to fully understand metal bioaccumulation in commercially important aquatic species and ensure the safety of human consumers.

AB  - INDONESIA: Ikan nila (Oreochromis nilotikus) merupakan salah satu jenis ikan penting dalam sistem budi daya perairan atau akuakultur. FOA (Food and Agriculture Organization) tahun 2010, menempatkan nila pada urutan ke tiga setelah udang dan salmon sebagai contoh sukses perikanan budi daya dunia. Salah satu alternatif pengawet alami adalah dengan menambahkan kombinasi air perasan buah blimbing wuluh (Averrhoa bilimbi L.) dengan garam NaCl. Perintah mempertahankan kesegaran ikan disebutkan dalam surat al Nahl ayat 14, bahwa pengendalian lautan untuk manusia agar dapat menangkap daging ikan segar. Senyawa aktif berupa flavonoid yang bersifat sebagai antibakteri berperan menjaga kualitas ikan. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk mengetahui pengaruh kombinasi air perasan dan garam dengan perbedaan waktu inkubasi. Pengaruh pemberian air perasan buah blimbing wuluh dan garam pada kualitas ikan, dilakukan dengan variasi waktu inkubasi yaitu 0 jam, 12 jam, dan 24 jam. Perlakuan terbaik dan kontrol yang dilanjutkan untuk diteliti dengan waktu inkubasi 12 jam dan 24 jam. Kemudian dianalisis TPC, kadar air, kadar protein, dan uji organoleptiknya. Dianalisis dengan menggunakan statistik RAK faktorial. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa nilai TPC ikan perlakuan lebih rendah nilainya jika dibandingkan dengan kontrol, baik ikan perlakuan maupun kontrol semakin lama waktu inkubasi maka nilai TPC nya semakin naik. Kadar air pada ikan hasil perlakuan mampu mempertahankannya sampai 12 jam waktu inkubasi, sedangkan pada kontrol hanya mampu bertahan sampai 0 jam. Kadar air pada tubuh ikan berkisar antara 66-84 %. Kadar protein pada ikan berkisar antara 16-22 %, ikan hasil perlakuan mampu bertahan sampai 24 jam sedangkan pada kontrol hanya mampu bertahan 12 jam. Uji organoleptik ikan nila berupa tekstur dan aroma semakin lama waktu inkubasi nilainya semakin menurun. ENGLISH: Tilapia (Oreochromis nilotikus) is one kind of important fish in aquaculture systems or aquaculture.

AB  - The quality of smolts is one of the key factors for successful salmon production. We compared growth performance, physiological traits, and environmental adaptation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) after transfer into a sea cages farm site from recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) to a similar sized group of the same genetic linage and produced in the same husbandry facility but under flow through system (FTS) conditions. Fish vertical distribution within the sea cages and water environment were continuously recorded, while biometry data and biological samples were collected monthly. No significant difference in size and smolt development between the FTS and RAS-produced fish were observed at the end of the freshwater phase. However, after transfer into seawater, the RAS fish showed an array of physiological and molecular differences that were maintained and resulted in significantly increased mortality and lower growth over the full production cycle. The RAS smolts were characterized by lower body weight, length, K factor, HSI (indicator of energy reserve), NKA activity, plasma levels of lactate, triacylglycerol, sodium, calcium, and phosphorus than FTS fish in seawater. This implicated osmoregulatory and allostatic maladaptation for the RAS fish during the first months in seawater. Both FTS and RAS fish showed physiological and behavioral adjustments during the seawater production linked with predictable (e.g., seasonal, diurnal) and short-term unpredictable variation in water temperature and oxygen. However, the RAS fish were characterized by lower physiological response to stressful effects of unpredictable environmental variability. Based on our data, the freshwater history set the basis for the performance success of the FTS and RAS smolts in seawater. FTS fish showed faster adaptation to the seawater environment, with higher osmoregulatory capacity, and higher physiological robustness to seasonal changes than RAS fish, which reflected in their difference in growth and harvest size. We emphasize the crucial role of the freshwater rearing conditions as the foundation for successful physiological adaptation to seawater, growth, and the success of salmon farming production.

The flood water, with high speed current seems to destroy and displaced several aquaculture facilities in Iran that propagate several fish species including the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. This study reports on the presence of specimens of rainbow trout seem to be probably washed away by the flood and ended in the river of Shatt al-Arab, Basrah, south of Iraq. With the harsh environment of Shatt al-Arab River, i.e., unfavourable high salinity and temperature, the question will remain whether the rainbow trout will survive and establish a populations?

AB  - Biological, environmental, economic and ethical issues become increasingly pertinent as the scale of the aquaculture industry expands. This study used acoustic telemetry data and wavelet analysis to investigate behavioural patterns of Atlantic salmon when exposed to artificial underwater lights in fully stocked production cages located on the Norwegian coast. Using acoustic depth sensor tags, time series of depth registrations were gathered from 21 individual salmon distributed over three cages during a five-month experimental period. Underwater lights, normally used to suppress pre-harvest sexual maturation amongst Atlantic salmon, were installed at eight-metre depth and switched on in the middle of the experimental period. Swimming depth registrations initially showed a typical diurnal swimming behaviour, manifested by registrations generally in deeper waters during day-time than during night-time. The diurnal swimming behaviour abruptly ceased after the onset of lights. The change in swimming behaviour was detected by wavelet analysis and coincided with the introduction of underwater lights. Results from this study demonstrate the utility of wavelet analysis as a timely surveillance tool when investigating behavioural patterns of a periodic nature in fish, and specifically the individual response of farmed salmon to artificial lighting in a genuine industrial setting.

AB  - Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) is a serious and commercially important pathogen of Atlantic salmon. Multiple viruses have been defined based on a highly polymorphic region (HPR) of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein encoded by genomic segment 6. The viruses causing disease outbreaks in farms to date all have deletions in this region with respect to a putative ancestral variant with a longer HPR (HPR0). The presence of HPR0 nucleic acid has been detected in many countries including Scotland, where it has mostly been associated with healthy wild and farmed fish. Pathogenic ISAVs appear to have been derived from HPR0 ancestors on multiple independent occasions, which suggests that the presence of HPR0 could represent a risk factor in the re-emergence of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) disease. In order to better understand this potential risk factor, anonymous samples of gill and heart tissues from marine Atlantic salmon farms throughout Scotland were collected and screened for the presence of ISAV RNA. Since it has not been possible to isolate HPR0 in conventional ISA-permissive cell cultures, a sensitive real-time RT-PCR method was employed for the detection of viral RNA. DNA sequencing was carried out on the positive samples to determine their HPR sequence. ISAV RNA was detected in 6 samples originating from 4 different locations and sequence analysis indicated the viruses were of the HPR0 type. Full length segment 6 sequence analysis of 1 positive sample indicated that it was most similar to a European genotype sequence previously obtained from North America.

EPC cell cultures containing various concentrations of methisoprinol (0, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 μg/ml of medium) were inoculated with VHS or IHN virus suspension containing 10 TCID50/ml. The inhibition of [H]-uridine incorporation into VHSV and IHNV RNA propagated in cell cultures with methisoprinol was demonstrated. The highest percentage of viral RNA inhibition was observed when a dose of 500 μg/ml was used. The results indicated that methisoprinol inhibits the replication of salmonid rhabdoviruses and possibly may be effective in prevention of viral infection in aquaculture.

AB  - <jats:p>The article highlights the ichthyological studies carried out in the Sysola river basin (a second order tributary of the Severnaya Dvina river), where rainbow trout is reared in cages for commercial purposes in the waters of regulated tributaries. The forecast for trout naturalization seems to be poor due to the fact that trout of different ages enter the river system every year as a result of technological accidents. It has been found that, despite the numerous cases of trout occurring in the natural conditions during 40 years, in the basin of the Sysola river has not formed a self-reproducing population of rainbow trout, and cases of its by-catch are rare. The data on the climatic and ecological conditions of the region are given. It has been inferred that the main factors preventing the naturalization of trout in the water bodies of the region are unfavorable temperature and hydrological regimes during the spawning and early ontogenesis of fish. The short summer feeding period does not allow trout to prepare for successful long wintering, as evidenced by a sharp decrease in the growth rate of fish that have fallen into natural conditions, compared to fish grown in cages. Trout of cage origin obviously do not form stable groups capable of reproducing the species and do not pose a threat to the aboriginal fish population, including Atlantic salmon, whose spawning and a significant part of the life cycle take place on many rivers of the north-eastern European Russia, including the basins of the Severnaya Dvina and Pechora rivers</jats:p>

AB  - Western Cape reservoir irrigation water can be used more efficiently when introducing trout production as an additional source of protein and income. However, cage aquaculture is known to add nutrients to water systems which need to be assimilated or removed to avoid water quality deterioration. Depending on lake ecology and hydrology, the fate of phosphorus, the key element to eutrophication in freshwater will have different effects. Aquaculture literature indicates impact on phosphorus content, hypolimnetic oxygen and phytoplankton compositions, but the effects depend on the production scale, reservoir size and hydrology. The aim of the literature review was to determine and describe available literature on current state, possible indicators and benchmarking between sustainable and non-sustainable aquaculture. As concluded, there are various research gaps: (i) the general status of the ecology of small Western Cape reservoirs ( 100 ha) and (iii) exposed sites (>100 ha) that show good mixing of the hypolimnion with the larger water body. Whilst reviewing the literature no effects of cage farming were detected only in the latter type of reservoir (Boyd et al. 2001). At smaller sites or sites of low exchange, the degrading effects of increasing phosphorus content, decreasing profundal oxygen concentration as well as alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages were detected (Gale 1999, Axler et al. 1996, Marsden et al. 1995, Stirling & Dey 1990). 2.1.1 Fish feed and aquaculture wastes Uneaten fish feed and fish faeces are the primary sources of nutrient input into waters during intensive aquaculture production (Podemski & Blanchfield 2006). The quality of feeding methods as well as feed composition have a great influence on the pollution potential and can be quantified by the food conversion ratio (FCR), which is the ratio between dry food added to the water and that retained as wet biomass in the fish flesh (Beveridge 2004). With a FCR approaching the optimum, which would be 1.0 with carnivorous fish completely dependent on additional feeding, the phosphorus release into the environment comprises of the phosphorus contained in the food minus the phosphorus retained in the fish. Trout flesh contains approximately 0.48 % of phosphorus (Beveridge 2004) while the majority of trout grower and grow-out feed applied in South Africa contains 1.2 % phosphorus (AquaNutro 2010). With a realistically achievable FCR of 1.2 with rainbow trout production in cages (Beveridge 2004), the amount of phosphorus released into the environment would therefore be 10.8 kg per ton of trout produced. In comparison, with a FCR of 2.0 the amount of phosphorus released into the environment would be approximately 19.2 kg per t of trout. This is approximately twice the load discarded as an optimum energy and nutrient loss. The minimum phosphorus released, even under ideal feeding conditions (FCR 1.0) would be 8.8 kg per ton of trout, about two thirds of the phosphorus in the feed (Temporetti et al. 2000). Improved trout feed formulations e.g. from the United States, were able to half this figure by reducing the phosphorus content in trout feed to concentrations of 0.7 to 0.9 % (Hinshaw 1999). There are different pathways for the release of phosphorus not incorporated into fish biomass. A proportion of the food offered to trout in cages will always remain and settle towards the lake bottom. The reason is that fish first have to recognize that food is present, and then secondly accept it as uncontaminated and of good tactile feel to the mouth. The location of the cage should be such that feed is not carried away, e.g. by currents (Beveridge 2004). To alleviate feed loss, one can improve food acceptance via olfactorial and visual attractants to meet tactile Chapter 2 Literature review 15 preferences. Float and sink characteristics of the food can be improved in order to optimally meet fish behaviour. Finally, feeding strategies and quantities can be adapted to certain weather conditions. All these factors will positively influence the FCR The proportion of uneaten feed also depends on stocking density and behavioural aspects, but can with conventional feeding be assumed to vary between 10 and 20 % at food conversion ratios reaching the optimum, and at a 1 to 5 % loss of uneaten feed when using self feeders (Geurden et al. 2005).

AB  - Rainbow trout (104.8±0.15g), Oncorhynchus mykiss, were fed a commercial extruded pellet for 7 weeks to investigate the effect of restricted feeding on performances. Three restricted feeding were tested: two day intervals (TDI), every other day (EOD) and twice a day (TD). Fish were held in fresh water at 9-13°C from January 16 to March 4, 2004. Feed conversion rate (FCR) were TDI and TD groups 1.33±0.03 and EOD group 1.54±0.03, protein efficiency ratio (PER) were TDI group 1.88±0.04, EOD group 1.59±0.03 and TD group 1.85±0.04, respectively. Although FCR was the same between TDI and TD, there was a significant differences in weight gain, relative growth rate (RGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) between the groups. These group evaluated the food at the same rate but since the given food amount were different, the weight gain, SGR and RGR of TD were the highest dependent to the food amount. Although the FCR was good in restricted fed fish, the taken feed amount sigificantly affected the growth parameters of fish. Relative growth rate (RGR), weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) were lower in TDI and EOD groups. Both specific growth rate and relative growth rate increased with number of restricted feeding. The restricted feeding influenced the chemical composition of the fish. The lipid, moisture and protein content of fish increased when the fish were fd twice a day (TD group). In terms of SGR and RGR, it can be concluded that the best growth rate was obtained from the fish fed twice a day (TD) and every other day (EOD) feeding for rainbow trout at 9-13oC.

AB  - Ownership of the product of living things, such as human tissue or cultures developed from human cells, is difficult for the law to determine. Civilian jurisdictions, with their legal heritage grounded in Roman law, offer one solution. Civilian jurisdictions would resolve such cases under the rules of specificatio (specification). A recent case from the Outer House of the Scottish Court of Session (Kinloch Damph Ltd v Nordvik Salmon Farms Ltd) addresses the problem. The case was properly decided, though the grounds of the decision could be improved. Specifically, on civil law principles, civilian courts ought to award ownership of a living thing to a maker/manufacturer who has altered the living thing's natural pattern of development.

AB  - The investigation of specific characteristics of Lepeophtheirus salmonis populations on farmed salmon was made possible by the examination of the parasite infestation parameters of regular non destructive samples taken for up to six years in five bays. Perennial persistence of seasonal patterns of infestation as exhibited by intensity, prevalence and abundance was examined. Site specific characteristics were detected which appeared to be independent of inter-annual variations. Seasonal variations in individual lice size and fecundity, and temporal variation in population dynamics on the farmed fish in the five bays are considered in the context of the not inconsiderable changes in husbandry and lice control practices which have been introduced in the industry over the six year period.

AB  - Background: Bioanalysis of large molecules can be challenging on LC–MS/MS due to multiply charged and endogenous interferences. While high sensitivity triple quadrupole systems (QqQ) have been commercialized recently, high-resolution MS (HRMS) systems are also available. HRMS provides alternative analysis methods, but more costly and with sensitivity lower than MRM on QqQ. Results: QqQ is generally operated at unit resolution; however, newer systems are able to practically tune to ‘high resolution’. Therefore, the advantages of both higher sensitivity of MRM on QqQ and better specificity on HRMS can possibly be combined on a QqQ to meet bioanalysis needs. Glucagon and salmon calcitonin were successfully quantified in high-resolution with fast cycle time on AB Sciex TripleQuad™ 5500. LLOQ (S/N) was increased and interferences reduced. Conclusion: For large molecules, the bioanalysis methods developed using high resolution on the QqQ are validated and used in preclinical and clinical studies.

AB  - Ractopamine is a synthetic catecholamine analogue which is known to improve feed efficiency, reduce carcass fat and increase lean muscle growth in terrestrial livestock (e.g. sheep, pigs, cattle and chickens), and therefore, may be useful in aquaculture production if similar effects can be elicited in fish. In the present study, rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), (mean initial weight of 196 g) were fed the β-agonist ractopamine at 0, 5, 10, 20 or 40 parts per million (p.p.m.) of the diet for 12 weeks in a complete, randomized experimental design. Growth and feed intake were monitored throughout the experiment. Carcasses were analysed for protein, fat, energy and ash prior to the initiation of the trial, and subsequently, every 4 weeks. The growth rate, expressed as thermal-unit growth coefficient (TGC) was higher (P ≤ 0.05) in the 10 p.p.m. groups during weeks 1-4 and when averaged over all treatment weeks. Feed efficiency was significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) in fish fed 10 and 5 p.p.m. ractopamine compared with controls during weeks 1-4 and 4-8, respectively, and was significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) in all treated groups when averaged over the 12-week treatment period. Compared with controls, carcass protein was elevated in fish fed 5 p.p.m. ractopamine for 4 weeks, and in those offered 10 and 20 p.p.m. for 8 weeks. Carcass fat was significantly lower (P ≤ 0.05) in fish fed 10 p.p.m. ractopamine for 8 weeks, although the 40 p.p.m. group exhibited elevated fat levels in comparison with control fish. The data suggest that rapidly growing rainbow trout demonstrate age-related growth and carcass compositional trends similar to those of mammals, in that feed efficiency and carcass protein decrease while carcass fat increases with age. Oral administration of ractopamine to rainbow trout only modestly altered growth performance, and the trends were not as dramatic nor as consistent as those observed in homeothermic vertebrates fed ractopamine. Out of the concentrations tested, feed incorporation of ractopamine at 10 p.p.m. elicited the most pronounced effect on growth performance.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Aquaculture is one of the most resource‐efficient and sustainable ways to produce animal protein. The Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that cultivated aquatic species will provide around 53% of the world's seafood supply by 2030. Further growth of intensive farmed aquatic species may be limited by a shortage of feed resources. The aquaculture sector therefore needs to intensify its search for alternative ingredients based on renewable natural resources. A significant increase in production will require an accelerated transition in technology and production systems, better use of natural available resources, development of high‐quality alternative feed resources and exploitation of available space. The present review discusses the urgent need to identify appropriate alternative ingredients for a sustainable future salmonid production. We describe and evaluate the most promising marine ingredients, including low‐trophic species (mesopelagic fish, zooplankton, polychaetes, macroalgae and crustaceans), novel microbial ingredients (bacteria, yeast and microalgae), insects (black soldier fly, yellow meal worm and crickets), animal by‐products (poultry meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal and hydrolysed feather meal) and by‐products from other commercial productions (trimmings and blood). Furthermore, we discuss the available volumes and need for new processing technologies and refining methods to ensure commercial production of nutritionally healthy ingredients. The essential production steps and considerations for future development of sustainable and safe seafood production are also discussed.</jats:p>

AB  - A rainbow trout high-density oligonucleotide microarray was constructed using all tentative consensus (TC) sequences that are publicly available from all international rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss genomic research projects through the Rainbow Trout Gene Index database. The new array contains 60-mer oligonucleotide probes representing 37 394 unique TC sequences and 1417 control spots. The array (4 × 44 format) was manufactured according to the design by Agilent Technologies using the inkjet-based SurePrint technology (design number 016320). The performance of the new microarray platform was evaluated by analysing gene expression associated with rainbow trout, vitellogenesis-induced muscle atrophy. This microarray will open new avenues of research that will aid in the development of novel strategies for genetic improvement for economically important traits benefiting the salmonid aquaculture industries.

AB  - Enrofloxacin (ENR) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic widely used due to its efficacy against pathogens. Microplastics (MPs) may bind to ENR and reduce its efficiency, whereas there would be an increase in its toxicity, bioavailability, and bio-accumulation rates. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the interaction between MPs and ENR can alter their toxicity and bioavailability. The subjective of this study is to examine the toxicity of various concentrations of ENR (0, 1.35, and 2.7 ml Kg<sup>-1</sup> diet) and MPs (0, 1000, and 2000 mg Kg<sup>-1</sup> diet) alone and in combination for 21 days. The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is an economic aquaculture species used as an experimental model in ecotoxicology studies. Blood biochemical analytes indicated that ENR and MPs combination led to increasing enzymatic activity of each biomarker, except for gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT). Alterations related to triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, urea, creatinine, total protein, and albumin blood contents were observed. An elevation in the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was found in the liver. In contrast, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels decreased. Furthermore, a decline was observed in the cellular total antioxidant (ANT) levels. These findings suggested that ENR and MPs could affect fish health both independently and together. Consequently, the study determined that when both ENR and MPs were present in high concentrations, the toxicity of ENR was amplified, providing further evidence of the synergistic impact of MPs on ENR toxicity.

AB  - Outer membrane porins, as the major components of Gram-negative bacterial membrane proteins, have been proven to be involved in interactions with the host immune system and potent protective antigen candidates against bacterial infection in fish. Outer membrane porin F (OmpF) is one of the major porins of Yersinia ruckeri (Y. ruckeri), the causative agent of enteric red mouth disease of salmonid and non-salmonid fish. In the present study, the molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of OmpF gene was studied, heterogenous expression, immunogenicity and protective immunity of OmpF were systemically evaluated as a subunit vaccine for channel catfish against Y. ruckeri infection. The results showed that OmpF gene was highly conserved among 15 known Yersinia species based on the analysis of conserved motifs, sequences alignment and phylogenetic tree, and was subjected to negative/purifying selection with global dN/dS ratios value of 0.649 throughout the evolution. Besides, OmpF was also identified to have immunogenicity by western blotting and was verified to be located on the surface of Y. ruckeri using cell surface staining and indirect immunofluorescence assays. Moreover, recombinant OmpF (rtOmpF) as a subunit vaccine was injected with commercial adjuvant ISA763, significantly enhanced the immune response by increasing serum antibody levels, lysozyme activity, complement C3 activity, total protein content, SOD activity, immune-related genes expression in the head kidney and spleen, and survival percent of channel catfish against Y. ruckeri infection. Thus, our present results not only enriched the information of molecular characterization and phylogenetics of OmpF, but also demonstrated that OmpF holds promise to be used as a potential antigen against Y. ruckeri infection in fish.

AB  - <jats:p>Molecular technologies may be quicker and more accurate than the culture, serology, and histology procedures that have historically been employed to identify fish parasites. By using molecular diagnostic methods, parasites can be found in asymptomatic fish, allowing disease outbreaks to be stopped. This review discusses the use of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) markers to detect parasite in aquaculture and their potential applications are discussed. It was found that it is a more reliable marker and species identification in combination with other DNA markers. ITS region are highly polymorphic non - coding region with sufficient taxonomic units. Thus, sequences can be separated at the species level. though ribosomal ITS as a universal barcode marker for parasite identification is still hampered by few limitations, the ITS will remain as the key choice for parasite identification. It remains the most important option for parasite identification. Many studies have been carried out using ITS markers for parasites identification such as cestode, nematodes, Pseudoterranova spp., Anisakis type I, Diplostomum, Gyrodactylids Hysterothylacium sp, Glochidia larvae. This identification of parasites are taken from the species Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Argentinesea bass, (Acanthistius patachonicus), and other samples from various places.</jats:p>

AB  - Texture of salmon fillets is an important quality trait for consumer acceptance as well as for the suitability for processing. In the present work we measured fillet firmness in a population of farmed Atlantic salmon with known pedigree and investigated the relationship between this trait and gene expression. Transcriptomic analyses performed with a 21 K oligonucleotide microarray revealed strong correlations between firmness and a large number of genes. Highly similar expression profiles were observed in several functional groups. Positive regression was found between firmness and genes encoding proteasome components (41 genes) and mitochondrial proteins (129 genes), proteins involved in stress responses (12 genes), and lipid metabolism (30 genes). Coefficients of determination (R(2)) were in the range of 0.64-0.74. A weaker though highly significant negative regression was seen in sugar metabolism (26 genes, R(2) = 0.66) and myofiber proteins (42 genes, R(2) = 0.54). Among individual genes that showed a strong association with firmness, there were extracellular matrix proteins (negative correlation), immune genes, and intracellular proteases (positive correlation). Several genes can be regarded as candidate markers of flesh quality (coiled-coil transcriptional coactivator b, AMP deaminase 3, and oligopeptide transporter 15) though their functional roles are unclear. To conclude, fillet firmness of Atlantic salmon depends largely on metabolic properties of the skeletal muscle; where aerobic metabolism using lipids as fuel, and the rapid removal of damaged proteins, appear to play a major role.

AB  - Longitudinal serological surveys for salmon pancreas disease virus (SPDV), the causal agent of pancreas disease (PD), were conducted on multiple caged populations of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., on two farms over a 77-week period (farm 1, freshwater and marine stages) and a 36-week period (farm 2, marine stage only), using a microtitre-based virus neutralization (VN) assay. Collected sera were also screened for viraemia with SPDV, and pancreas, heart and muscle tissues were examined for lesions consistent with PD. Outbreaks of PD occurred during the marine phase on both farms, as demonstrated by seroconversion, the isolation of virus and progressive histopathological changes consistent with a PD outbreak. All populations monitored showed a progressive increase in seroprevalence of 90-100%, typically accompanied by rises in geometric mean antibody titres. With the exception of one caged population, which showed a marked biphasic seroprevalence pattern, the seroprevalence figures in the remaining four monitored populations remained high (> or =70%) until the end of the study period. Peak VN titres of > or =1/1280 were detected on both farms. The results provide essential baseline information for the interpretation of SPDV VN serology results, and indicate that this methodology is suited to both the diagnosis and seroepidemiology of SPDV infections.

AB  - The conversion of estuarine marshes and floodplains to agricultural uses through diking, draining, and filling has left little adequate salmon habitat and, as a result, has been a critical factor in the decline of salmon populations. Current efforts to restore salmon by reestablishing ecosystem functionality. In particular, it has become more common to include dam and dike breaches as feasible solutions. Of course, there is a cost involved in habitat restoration, even if it is not an obvious environmental cost. This article examines the dialogue on salmon valuation by contrasting the historical view of salmon-as-commodity with insights from "ecosystem services." This emerging trend in ecological economics will play a critical role in justifying restoration projects and formulating sustainability strategies; ecosystem services valuation is showing that investments in natural capital can provide substantial returns. This article also provides a case study of the Smith Island Habitat Restoration Project in Snohomish County, Washington. Smith Island, which was converted to farmland a century ago, exhibits enormous potential value for habitat restoration and begs for an inclusive process that considers the voices for economic, human, and ecosystem well-being. The resolution of the Smith Island controversy provides an insightful example of how a sustainability framework can be useful in showing that restoration strategies can offer substantial benefits to other lands uses and interests.

Increases in dietary SPC were combined with appropriate increases in methionine, lysine and threonine supplementation, whereas added phosphorus was constant among treatments. Diets were administered to quadruplicate groups of 29 g juvenile Atlantic salmon were exposed to constant light, for 97 days. On Day 63 salmon were subjected to vaccination. Significant weight reductions in SPC65 and SPC80 compared with SPC35 salmon were observed by Day 97. Linear reductions in body cross-sectional ash, Ca/P ratios, and Ca, P, Mn and Zn were observed at Days 63 (prior vaccination) and 97 (34 days post-vaccination), while Mg presented a decrease at Day 63, in salmon fed increasing dietary SPC. Significant reductions in Zn, Ca, P and Ca/P ratios persisted in SPC65 and SPC80 compared with SPC35 salmon at Day 97. Significant haematocrit reductions in SPC50, SPC65 and SPC80 salmon were observed at Days 63, 70 and 97. Enhanced plasma haemolytic activity, increased total IgM, and a rise in thrombocytes were demonstrated in SPC50 and SPC65 salmon on Day 97, while increased lysozyme activity was demonstrated for these groups on Days 63, 70 and 97. Leucocyte and lymphocyte counts revealed enhanced immunostimulation in salmon fed with increasing dietary SPC at Day 97. High SPC inclusion diets did not compromise the immune responses of salmon, while SPC50 diet also supported good growth without compromising elemental concentrations.

AB  - The aim of this study was to diagnose the presence of Piscirickettsia salmonis in samples of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from fish farms in the Los Lagos Region, Chile, which presented outbreaks of piscirickettsiosis. In total, 19 fish with clinical signs of piscirickettsiosis were used. Smears of kidney, liver and splenic tissue and intestinal content were made, and processed using the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT) for the detection of P. salmonis through a commercial kit. The data obtained were subjected to the Cochran and McNemar Q test in the Chi square distribution. Higher positivity was found in the liver (68.4%) and kidney (52.6%). In addition, the bacterium was found in the faeces (47.4%), indicating that the elimination via the faeces of the agent is possible under farming conditions. By associating the kidney and liver results, only 78.9% of the fish positive for the bacteria could be detected, while by associating the liver, spleen and faeces results, 100% of the fish positive to P. salmonis can be detected.

AB  - Suboptimal vitamin D status is common among humans, and might increase bone resorption with subsequent negative effects on bone health. Fatty fish, including Atlantic salmon, is an important dietary vitamin D source. However, due to a considerable change in fish feed composition, the contribution of vitamin D from salmon fillet has been reduced. The main objective was to investigate if intake of vitamin D 3 enriched salmon or vitamin D 3 tablets decreased bone biomarkers (urinary N-telopeptides, deoxypyridinoline, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin) compared to a low vitamin D 3 intake. The 122 healthy postmenopausal women included in this 12 weeks intervention trial were randomized into four groups: three salmon groups (150 grams/two times/week) and one tablet group (800 IU vitamin D and 1000 mg calcium/day). The salmon groups also received calcium supplements. The salmon had three different vitamin D 3 /vitamin K 1 combinations: high D 3 +high K 1 , low D 3 +high K 1 , or high D 3 +low K 1 . Increased intake of salmon containing high levels of vitamin D 3 (0.35-0.38 mg/kg/fillet) and supplements with the same weekly contribution had a positive influence on bone health as measured by bone biomarkers in postmenopausal women. Consequently, an increased level of vitamin D 3 at least to original level in feed for salmonids will contribute to an improved vitamin D 3 status and may improve human bone health.

AB  - The liver is a multitasking organ with essential functions for vertebrate health spanning metabolism and immunity. In contrast to mammals, our understanding of liver cellular heterogeneity and its role in regulating immunological status remains poorly defined in fishes. Addressing this knowledge gap, we generated a transcriptomic atlas of 47,432 nuclei isolated from the liver of Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i> L.) contrasting control fish with those challenged with a pathogenic strain of <i>Aeromonas salmonicida</i>, a problematic bacterial pathogen in global aquaculture. We identified the major liver cell types and their sub-populations, revealing poor conservation of many hepatic cell marker genes utilized in mammals, while identifying novel heterogeneity within the hepatocyte, lymphoid, and myeloid lineages. This included polyploid hepatocytes, multiple T cell populations including γδ T cells, and candidate populations of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells. A dominant hepatocyte population radically remodeled its transcriptome following infection to activate the acute phase response and other defense functions, while repressing routine functions such as metabolism. These defense-specialized hepatocytes showed strong activation of genes controlling protein synthesis and secretion, presumably to support the release of acute phase proteins into circulation. The infection response further involved up-regulation of numerous genes in an immune-cell specific manner, reflecting functions in pathogen recognition and killing, antigen presentation, phagocytosis, regulation of inflammation, B cell differentiation and T cell activation. Overall, this study greatly enhances our understanding of the multifaceted role played by liver immune and non-immune cells in host defense and metabolic remodeling following infection and provides many novel cell-specific marker genes to empower future studies of this organ in fishes.

AB  - We consider the optimal harvesting problem for a fish farmer in a model which accounts for stochastic prices featuring a Schwartz 97 two factor price dynamics. Unlike any other literature in this context, we take account of the existence of a newly established market in salmon futures, which determines risk premia and other relevant variables, that influence the fish farmer in his decision. We consider the cases of single and infinite rotations. The value function of the harvesting problem determined in our arbitrage free setup constitutes the fair value of lease and ownership of the fish farm when correctly accounting for price risk. The data set used for this analysis contains a large set of futures contracts with different maturities traded at the Fish Pool market between 12/06/2006 and 22/03/2012.

AB  - Fisheries are coupled human and natural systems across space and time, involving movements of fish, money, and information in a globalized world. However, these social-ecological interactions over local to global scales are largely absent from the fisheries literature, as fisheries research to date has often been discipline- and location-specific. We analyzed this knowledge gap by using an emerging coupled human and natural systems research paradigm – the telecoupling framework – to investigate social-ecological interactions over distances (i.e. telecouplings) in the Great Lakes salmonine (i.e. Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha) fishery. Since the 1960s, this fishery has involved telecoupled movements of fish, money, and information over relatively long distances facilitated by numerous individual and organizational agents. These telecouplings have been characterized by diverse social-ecological causes (e.g. decline of commercial fisheries, rising incomes and greater leisure time for recreational fishing) and effects (e.g. salmonine stocking, creation of angling- and tourism-based economies). Telecouplings are critical for fisheries professionals to consider because they promote holistic understanding of fisheries management while occasionally confounding conservation efforts (e.g. salmonine stocking spreads diseases and parasites and changes fish community structure and genetic integrity). Hence, fisheries professionals will benefit from using the telecoupling framework to optimize favorable and reduce unfavorable telecouplings and thereby enhance fisheries management programs. Overall, the telecoupling framework advances fisheries science by enabling fisheries professionals to systematically understand the causes and consequences of complex social-ecological fisheries interactions and develop informed strategies for sustainable fisheries management and governance throughout the Great Lakes and the world.

AB  - Numbers and species of motile Aeromonas were determined in freshly caught freshwater fish, in the surrounding environment, and also during iced chilled storage of fish specimens. Although no significant differences were observed in water samples, initial levels for skin, gill, and intestines were significantly lower in farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) than in wild brown trout (Salmo trutta) and pike (Esox lucius). During storage of wild specimens, naturally occurring aeromonads grew fairly well on the surfaces of skin and body cavity. Of 171 strains assigned to the genus Aeromonas, 88% were identified to phenospecies and putative genospecies level by using comprehensive biochemical schemes. The isolates were allocated to putative hybridization groups (HGs) 1 and 3 Aeromonas hydrophila (29%); putative HG 8 Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria (19%); putative HG 2 Aeromonas bestiarum (18%); putative HG 9 Aeromonas jandaei (16%); putative HGs 4 and 5a Aeromonas caviae (2%); putative HG 12 Aeromonas schubertii (2%); and putative HG 11 (unnamed, 0.6%). The remaining 20 isolates (12%) resembled A. schubertii but could not be allocated to currently recognized phenospecies or to putative HGs. Although cultured rainbow trout yielded strains of putative HGs 1, 4, and 8, which appear to be of major clinical importance, most isolates assigned to putative HGs 1 and 8 were recovered from pike. Differences among HGs found in wild animals could be related to their origin (unpolluted rivers for brown trout and urban rivers for pike). The recovery of these aeromonads species was not related to sampling site. The initial levels of motile aeromonads, their behavior during storage, and the strong potential spoilage activity of most isolates confirm that these bacteria can contribute to deterioration of iced wild freshwater fish. Although adequate cooking would inactivate motile aeromonads, the high incidence of isolates belonging to gastroenteritis-associated HGs should be regarded as a potential health concern, particularly for susceptible populations when there is a possibility of cross-contamination.

AB  - Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) is a reovirus that has predominantly been detected in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). PRV is associated with heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon, and recently erythrocytes were identified as major target cells. The study of PRV replication and pathogenesis of the infection has been impeded by the inability to propagate PRV in vitro. In this study we developed an ex vivo cultivation system for PRV in Atlantic salmon erythrocytes. PRV was successfully passaged to naive erythrocytes using lysates of blood cells from infected salmon. During cultivation a significant increase in viral load was observed by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, which coincided with the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions resembled viral factories and contained both PRV protein and dsRNA. In addition, the erythrocytes generated an antiviral immune gene activation after PRV infection, with significant up-regulation of IFN-α, RIG-I, Mx and PKR transcripts. Supernatants from the first passage successfully transmitted virus to naive erythrocytes. This study demonstrates that PRV replicates in Atlantic salmon erythrocytes ex vivo. The ex vivo infection model closely reflects the situation in vivo and can be used to study the infection and replication mechanisms of PRV, as well as the antiviral immune responses of salmonid erythrocytes.

AB  - The United States today imports most of the seafood it consumes. Half of these imports are from aquaculture. Domestic wild capture production is limited and U.S. aquaculture production has declined in recent years. Policy, socioeconomic, and regulatory obstacles stand in the way of expanded U.S. aquaculture production. In this article, we examine the implications of two future paths for seafood supply: an increasing reliance on imports, and a shift toward increased domestic aquaculture production. We examine global trends, likely future developments in U.S. seafood demand and supply, and implications of the path of U.S. aquaculture development for U.S. seafood supply and prices, employment, ecological footprint, and seafood supply security and safety. We conclude with recommendations for a path forward that serves the interests of the nation and the global community in the search for economically sound and sustainable ways to feed a growing population.

AB  - The decline of Pacific salmon populations on the west coast of Canada has been observed for decades. Hatcheries are used as one solution to this issue, however the benefits and detriments of releasing hatchery-grown salmon into the wild are widely debated. We investigated the release and return numbers of Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha , at the Capilano River Hatchery in North Vancouver, British Columbia. This study focuses on: (1) establishing whether or not there is a declining trend in the number of returning Chinook salmon over the past seven years, and (2) deciphering the survival rate of a population of salmon. Data was collected by counting the returning Chinook salmon over 10 trials of one hour each. We calculated daily average as well as the use of the release and return data of previous years at the Capilano River Hatchery. The returning rate of Chinook salmon over the past seven years displayed a declining trend until the input of our data, which may be a result of unaccounted environmental factors, such as river height. The return numbers for the 2010 population of Chinook salmon was less than 1.28% in comparison to the amount of salmon released (98.1%). When comparing 2010-2016 return numbers per year, there was no significant effect on returns (z=0.864, df=6, p=0.3875), but there was a significant effect of both Sea Surface Temperature (SST) (z=2.343, df=6, p=0.0191) and an interaction between year and SST (z=-2.338, df=6, p=0.0194) on return numbers. The benefits of these hatcheries remain unclear and should be further studied.

AB  - The effects of extended autumn daylength and winter fasting on growth and smolting were studied in one-year-old Saimaa landlocked salmon. Underyearling juveniles were either exposed to extended light LD 20:4 regime (LD group) during August-October or reared under routine fish-farm illumination (ND group). After the photoperiod manipulation, LD fish were larger and a greater number of them belonged to upper size classes in comparison with ND fish. Upper size class fish from both photoperiod groups were selected for further experiments in which the fish were either fed or fasted during winter. Contrary to the LD fish, the ND fish increased their length and weight during January-March by which they achieved the size of the LD fish. There was a clear size difference between the ND fed and fasted groups during March-April, but the fasted fish compensated for their growth suppression soon after the feeding was started again. The activity of gill Na + ,K + -ATPase was lower in the ND fasted group during January-March as compared with that of the ND fed group suggesting that smolting may be switched off by poor nutritional conditions. The different gill Na + ,K + -ATPase profiles between the ND and the LD fish may indicate disturbed endogenous smolting cycle of the LD fish. However, despite these differences, all groups, independently of the treatment, completed their smolting at the same time in June as indicated by elevated gill Na + ,K + -ATPase activity, enhanced salinity tolerance, and hypoosmoregulatory ability. Lower levels of plasma sodium, chloride and magnesium in freshwater observed in all groups during spring-early summer coincident with other changes typical for smolting indicate gradually increasing maladaptation of the fish to freshwater. These results as well as an observed increase in potassium concentration in freshwater during spring-summer suggest that downstream migration is more like a passive than active process.

The fish were divided into four experimental groups. Two groups were fed experimental feeds (group TU basic feed; group TUB basic feed with Bioimmuno), and two groups were fed commercial feeds (group TB commercial feed; group TBF commercial feed with FOCUS Plus®). After 14 and 28 days of rearing (the end of the experiment) specimens were measured and blood was drawn from seven fish from each group for hematological and biochemical tests. No effects were confirmed on rearing parameters. After 14 days of rearing, decreased values of WBC, RBC, HGB, and HCT were noted in groups TU and TB, while after 28 days lower values of RBC and HCT persisted in these groups. Lower values of these parameters were also noted in group TUB. Increased ALP activity was noted in group TUB after 14 days, while in groups TU and TUB increased levels of TP and ALB were noted after 28 days. A significant increase in ALB was also noted in group TBF. The functional feeds positively affected the physiological state of the sea trout. The results indicated that it is necessary to conduct studies to determine the optimal dose of Bioimmuno for juvenile sea trout and the period during which functional feeds should be given.</jats:p>

AB  - Brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>) is an important aquaculture species in Germany, but its production faces challenges due to global warming and a high embryo mortality. Climate factors might influence the fish's bacterial community (BC) and thus increase embryo mortality. Yet, knowledge of the physiological BC during ontogeny in general is scarce. In this project, the BC of brown trout has been investigated in a period from unfertilized egg to 95 days post fertilization (dpf) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Developmental changes differed between early and late ontogeny and major differences in BC occurred especially during early developmental stages. Thus, analysis was conducted separately for 0 to 67 dpf and from 67 to 95 dpf. All analyzed stages were sampled in toto to avoid bias due to different sampling methods in different developmental stages. The most abundant phylum in the BC of all developmental stages was Pseudomonadota, while only two families (Comamonadaceae and Moraxellaceae) occurred in all developmental stages. The early developmental stages until 67 dpf displayed greater shifts in their BC regarding bacterial richness, microbial diversity, and taxonomic composition. Thereafter, in the fry stages, the BC seemed to stabilize and changes were moderate. In future studies, a reduction in the sampling time frames during early development, an increase in sampling numbers, and an attempt for biological reproduction in order to characterize the causes of these variations is recommended.

AB  - The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend twice weekly fish intake. Farmed Atlantic salmon is a good source of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids which have positive lipid modifying effects; however, it is unknown whether these responses are dose-dependent. Our primary research objective was to determine the effect of dose-dependent intake of farmed Atlantic salmon on lipoprotein particle (P) size and concentration. We hypothesized that low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-P and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-P size and concentration would increase with salmon intake in a dose-dependent manner. Overweight, adult participants (n = 19) were enrolled in a cross-over designed clinical trial evaluating intake of farmed Atlantic salmon. In random order, participants were assigned to 90, 180, or 270 g of salmon twice weekly for 4-week dietary treatments. Following a 4- to 8-week washout, participants crossed over to another dose of fish intake until all treatments were completed. Plasma lipid concentrations were determined and serum lipoprotein concentrations and particle size were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. Intake of salmon reduced plasma and serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations and increased plasma HDL-C concentrations. The concentrations of large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-P and chylomicron (CM)-P were reduced. Large LDL-P concentrations were increased in a dose-dependent manner. The mean size of VLDL-P was reduced and that of LDL was increased. Total TG was reduced as was the TG content of VLDL-P and CM-P. Twice weekly intake of farmed Atlantic salmon portions influences lipoprotein particle size and concentration in a manner associated with cardiovascular disease risk reduction.

AB  - Amoebic gill disease (AGD) is the most significant health problem affecting the production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in Tasmania, Australia. AGD affects a number of cultured fish species worldwide, however its impact is insignificant when compared to that in Tasmania. The disease was first identified in southern Tasmania in 1986 shortly after the initiation of Atlantic salmon farming. AGD is a result of an endemic parasite Neoparamoeba sp. attaching to the salmon's gill tissue. Research conducted over the years has resulted in a large reduction of AGD associated mortalities. However, the disease continues to place a significant financial burden on the industry with the only effective form of treatment being freshwater baths, a strategy implemented in the late 1980's. Epidemiological studies are essential as they facilitate in identifying causal factors that may be associated with disease outbreaks. An understanding of these complex interactions is required in order to implement effective control and prevention strategies. This thesis examined a number of environmental conditions and husbandry protocols currently utilised in the Atlantic salmon industry in Tasmania. Fallowing of lease sites as a disease management strategy for AGD was found to be unsuccessful. The mean AGD prevalence of Atlantic salmon cultured at a fallowed site (57.5% ± 5.32) was similar to fish at the control site (52.3% ± 5.35). Neoparamoeba sp. was isolated from environmental samples at the fallowed site despite the absence of salmon. Atlantic salmon maintained in copper based antifouling paint treated nets had a higher mean prevalence of AGD (29 .2% ± 6.74) compared to salmon maintained in untreated nets (21.3% ± 6.43). The belief that copper acts as an attractant for Neoparamoeba sp. was not ascertained. Atlantic salmon maintained under continuos artificial lights had a similar prevalence of AGD as salmon maintained under natural light conditions for the majority of a 12 month trial. However when subjected to stressful conditions the salmon maintained under artificial lights had a significantly higher percentage of gill lesions (43.1 % ± 4.38) compared to salmon held under natural light conditions (14.11%± 1.96). An Atlantic salmon farm located in the Tamar River in the north of Tasmania was studied as a control site, as the farm had been operating for approximately 5 years with no history of AGD. Neoparamoeba sp. was isolated from the benthic sediment and nylon nets, but not detected on steel nets or the salmon's gills. However approximately 12 months after the trial concluded the farm experienced its first outbreak of AGD. The work contained in this thesis has identified a number of environmental and husbandry practices that warrant further investigation to accurately understand their influence on the occurrence of AGD in Tasmanian cultured Atlantic salmon. Future research must also concentrate on identifying and understanding the causative agent/s involved in this disease in order to develop effective treatments.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The seafood sector is facing difficulties to meet the increasing demand for product greenhouse gas emission (GHG) assessments. We quantified GHGs of important seafood products of Norway, the world's second largest seafood exporter. We present results and improvement options for products of farmed salmon and wild‐caught shrimp, king crab, cod, and herring, followed to their dominating markets, based on detailed data for 2017. To enable more frequent monitoring, without engaging in a full assessment, we then suggest a simplified approach, focusing on the main drivers of production‐related emissions. The simplified approach is used to analyze temporal trends from 2007–2017 for fisheries and 1990–2017 for salmon aquaculture. Finally, the simplified approach was compared to the comprehensive assessment for 2017 to define species‐specific upscaling factors. Results show that salmon and crustacean products in 2017 caused higher emissions than cod and herring products, with feed and fuel use being the main emission drivers, whereas airfreighted products had the highest emissions of all products. Large improvement potential from average to best performers within each production system exists. The simplified approach shows that the fuel‐use intensity of Norwegian fisheries has increased by almost 50% for shrimp over the past decade whereas it has decreased for fish by 20% for demersal species such as cod and 5–10% for pelagic species such as herring. Feed‐related emissions for salmon, on the other hand, have increased by almost 30% during the same period, because of an increasing feed conversion ratio and increased inclusion of emission‐intensive feed inputs.</jats:p>

AB  - We describe a physically based empirical technique for correcting historical sea surface temperature measurements for time-varying biases. The corrections are based on models of heat and moisture transfers from uninsulated (canvas) and partially insulated (wooden) sea temperature buckets exposed on deck. One of the canvas bucket models is tested using measurements on board ship and published wind-tunnel measurements. The method gives geographically and seasonally varying bias corrections through the period 1856 to 1941. The corrections are fairly insensitive to uncertainties such as the size of the bucket or the details of its exposure on deck. A discussion of the history of sea surface temperature observations provides a background to the procedure. The resulting globally and seasonally averaged sea surface temperature corrections increase from 0.11 degC in 1856 to 0.42 degC by 1940. The corrections are compatible with recent measurements made at sea of the errors of canvas buckets. Global and hemispheric time series of corrected sea surface temperature and night marine air temperature data show good agreement: more detailed verifications of the corrections will be reported elsewhere.

AB  - Information on marine and freshwater survival and exploitation of River Bush salmon was developed into a model illustrating the potential ranges of grilse production per 1000 smolts. Values were attributed to the grilse ‘crop’ at each of three potential production stages – commercial landings, angler catches and fertilized egg production – using both published and derived valuations. Using the model, a range of values per wild smolt was calculated for grilse production on the River Bush.

AB  - Necropsy findings in adult salmon with subclinical "Hitra disease" (hemorrhagic syndrome) varied from negligible to hemorrhagic diathesis with generalized edema. By light microscopy, minute vessels were dilated, arterioles had mural necrosis, and thrombi were present. Occlusions consisted of fused erythrocytes and fibrin. Ultrastructurally, endothelial nuclei were pyknotic with condensed chromatin. The cytoplasm con- tained numerous laminar structures and electron-dense particles. Damaged erythrocytes adhered to the degen- erated endothelium, and coalesced erythrocytes had formed mural thrombi or filled the vascular lumen. Mi- crothrombi were frequently seen. There were no thrombocytes in the thrombi, which consisted of erythrocytes or reticulocytes. Clinically healthy farmed salmon pan showed the same disorders as did adults, but to a far lesser degree. Wild salmon parr had normal microvasculature. Results indicate that disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurs in "Hitra disease" in farmed Atlantic salmon. Since it was first recognized in 1977, "Hitra disease," or hemorrhagic syndrome, has been the most econom- ically significant disease in Norwegian salmonid farm- ing. The eponym "Hitra disease" refers to the island where the disease first posed a major problem. The disease affects any age-class of fish in seawater and has a greater prevalence in winter.29 "Hitra disease" is al- most exclusively a disease in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.)¶ although it is known to occur in rain- bow trout (Salmo gairdneri Richardson). It has only been reported twice from outside of Norway, i.e., from Scotland2 and from the Faroe islands (A. Mortensen, personal communication). "Hitra disease" is characterized by a hemorrhagic diathe~is~.~~ and, in the terminal stage, by stupor and coma.' The etiology is controversial. Some maintain an infectious theory, based on the presence of a specific Vibrio sp. in diseased fish, while others relate the disease to the lack of dietary selenium and vitamin E.13.28 Preliminary investigations in our laboratory on adult salmon with subclinical "Hitra disease" revealed mi- croscopic lesions, including mural degeneration and necrosis, in minute vessels, eosinophilic intravascular precipitates, thrombosis, congestion, hemorrhages with hemolysis, and generalized edema in a number of or- gans. These findings suggested that disseminated in- travascular coagulation (DIC) might be part of the syn- drome. Observations on clinically healthy, farmed salmon parr disclosed lesser, but similar, disorders of the microvasculature, which suggested that the process also took place in fre~hwater.~~ Presumptive clinico- chemical evidence of a coagulopathy similar to DIC has been reported in a number of fish Histopathology confirming DIC in fish seems, how- ever, to be lacking. The present work describes the microvascular histopathology in farmed Atlantic salm- on with subclinical "Hitra disease" to determine if DIC is a basic pathologic process in this syndrome.

AB  - Worldwide, viral diseases pose a serious challenge to the fish farming industry and wild fish stocks. In order to prevent the spread of serious fish diseases and to contain and control fish disease outbreaks at a global scale, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has published relevant data on these fish diseases, both in the Aquatic Animal Health Code (OIE, 2017a), including the OIE listed fish diseases, and in the Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals (OIE, 2017b), including recommended diagnostic methods. The list of viral OIE notifiable fish diseases currently includes: Epizootic haematopoietic necrosis disease (EHN), Infection with HPR-deleted or HPR0 infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISA), Infection with salmonid alphavirus, causing Pancreas disease (PD) and Sleeping disease (SD), Infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN), Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD), Red sea bream iridoviral disease (RSIVD), Spring viraemia of carp (SVC), and Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS). At European Union level, Commission Decision 2006/88/EC and Council Implementing Decision 2015/1554/EC provide specific regulation for surveillance and control of listed infectious aquatic diseases in Europe which include the fish viral diseases VHS, IHN, EHN, ISA, and KHVD (European Commission 2006, 2015). Due to the frequent emergence of new serious fish viral diseases, the OIE list of fish viral diseases is regularly being extended. However, apart from these well studied viral diseases, other non-notifiable serious fish viral diseases occur in freshwater fish farming. To focus on these new viral threats for freshwater fish farming, an open workshop was organized at the EAFP Conference at Belfast, 4th September 2017. The workshop consisted of five short lectures and a discussion, involving an audience of 69 international experts, originating from 25 countries, of which 6 outside Europe. The main topics presented included issues related to: i) the difficulty of preventing the global spread of cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2), ii) perhabdoviruses as a threat for percid farming, iii) pathogenesis and diagnostics of piscine orthoreoviruses in farmed rainbow trout, iv) Carp Edema Virus (CEV) in Europe, and v) the potential role of fish endogenous retroviruses in disease emergence. The general aim of the workshop was to identify potential collaborative approaches to carry out multidisciplinary studies aiming to define risks, diagnostic methods and suggest adequate prophylactic measures.

AB  - Use of phytobiotics as immunostimulant is increasing in aquaculture. In this study, the immune and growth prompting effects of parsley extract (PUE) were examined in the rainbow trout. In this regard, the various dietary levels of parsley extract (PUE), Petroselinum crispum (0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 4.5%) was added to the diet of rainbow trout to assay its potentials on immunity, growth, digestive enzymes, and mitigating ammonia-induced stress. A total of 450 fish (15.43 ±0.06 g; mean ± SE) were distributed into fifteen 300-L fiberglass tanks (30 fish per tank) and fed PUE for 60 days and then challenged with unionized ammonia (0.3 mg/l). According to results, PUE mainly at 3-4.5% levels increased the growth, lipase and protease activities, hemoral and mucusal immune components and liver antioxidant enzymes activities. These effects were kept even after ammonia stress, where the immune components were higher in PUE-treated fish than the control group. Furthermore, the dietary PUE reduced ammonia-related oxidative stress, as of malondialdehyde (MDA) values (as the indicator of lipid peroxidation) decreased in fish fed PUE. The concentrations of liver metabolic enzymes in blood both before and after ammonia stress declined in the fish fed PUE. Our findings demostrated the growth and immune boosting and ammonia-stress mitigating properties of PUE in rainbow trout.

AB  - The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an important parasite of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). It is widely spread in aquaculture facilities and leads to economic losses every year. As it has developed resistances against many common treatments, new control methods must be established. Here we characterize a novel gene family of the salmon louse, consisting of two genes, which has not been described in other species before. We analyzed temporal expression patterns of both genes, the localization of mRNA and protein. An RNAi mediated gene knockdown lead to information about the function of the protein. Overall, these two genes are expressed only in sperm ducts of male sea lice. The mucin-like proteins can additionally be found in the wall of spermatophores, which are responsible for sperm transfer to females. Knockdown showed that both genes are essential for successful fertilization of females. Overall, all results indicate that the two analyzed genes are necessary for reproduction in sea lice as they are essential for the formation of a wall surrounding the spermatophores, which is needed for fertilization. Therefore, we name them Mucin-like spermatophore wall protein 1 & 2 (MLSWP1 & MLSWP2). Analysis of sequence data from other copepod species suggests that MLSWPs are present in many copepod species and may also play a similar role in reproduction in those species.

AB  - Fine-scale habitat selection of Chilean dolphins was studied between January and April 2002 through shore- based theodolite tracking in order to investigate the environmental and behavioural determinants of habitat use, and to evaluate the interactions between this species and aquaculture activities in Yaldad Bay, southern Chile. During 293.5 h of effort, movement and habitat selection patterns of dolphins exhibited a significantly concentrated use of only 21% of the entire study area. Correspondence analysis showed that shallow waters (5-10 m), proximity to coast and rivers were the most significant environmental parameters determining fine- scale dolphin distribution patterns, with foraging the most frequently observed activity. Aquaculture activities in the area were observed to affect dolphin habitat use patterns by restricting space available for biologically important dolphin behaviours.

AB  - Biotype 2 (BT2) variants of the bacterium Yersinia ruckeri are an increasing disease problem in U.S. and European aquaculture and have been characterized as serovar 1 isolates that lack both peritrichous flagella and secreted phospholipase activity. The emergence of this biotype has been associated with an increased frequency of enteric redmouth disease (ERM) outbreaks in previously vaccinated salmonid fish. In this study, four independent specific natural mutations that cause the loss of both motility and secreted lipase activity were identified in BT2 strains from the United States, United Kingdom, and mainland Europe. Each of these was a unique mutation in either fliR, flhA, or flhB, all of which are genes predicted to encode essential components of the flagellar secretion apparatus. Our results demonstrate the existence of independent mutations leading to the BT2 phenotype; thus, this phenotype has emerged separately at least four times. In addition, BT2 strains from the United Kingdom were shown to have the same mutant allele found in U.S. BT2 strains, suggesting a common origin of this BT2 lineage. This differentiation of distinct BT2 lineages is of critical importance for the development and validation of alternative vaccines or other treatment strategies intended for the control of BT2 strains.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Mass mortality events (MMEs) are defined as the death of large numbers of fish over a short period of time. These events can result in catastrophic losses to the Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry and the local economy. However, they are challenging to understand because of their relative infrequency and the high number of potential factors involved. As a result, the causes and consequences of MMEs in Atlantic salmon aquaculture are not well understood. In this study, we developed a structural network of causal risk factors for MMEs for aquaculture and the communities that depend on Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique, we analysed the causes of Atlantic salmon mass mortalities due to environmental (abiotic), biological (biotic) and nutritional risk factors. The consequences of MMEs were also assessed for the occupational health and safety of aquaculture workers and their implications for the livelihoods of local communities. This structural network deepens our understanding of MMEs and points to management actions and interventions that can help mitigate mass mortalities. MMEs are typically not the result of a single risk factor but are caused by the systematic interaction of risk factors related to the environment, fish diseases, feeding/nutrition and cage‐site management. Results also indicate that considerations of health and safety risk, through pre‐ and post‐event risk assessments, may help to minimize workplace injuries and eliminate potential risks of human fatalities. Company and government‐assisted socio‐economic measures could help mitigate post‐mass mortality impacts. Appropriate and timely management actions may help reduce MMEs at Atlantic salmon cage sites and minimize the physical and social vulnerabilities of workers and local communities.</jats:p>

AB  - Background: Piscine reovirus (PRV) is a newly discovered fish reovirus of anadromous and marine fish ubiquitous among fish in Norwegian salmon farms, and likely the causative agent of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI). HSMI is an increasingly economically significant disease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms. The nucleotide sequence data available for PRV are limited, and there is no genetic information on this virus outside of Norway and none from wild fish. Methods: RT-PCR amplification and sequencing were used to obtain the complete viral genome of PRV (10 segments) from western Canada and Chile. The genetic diversity among the PRV strains and their relationship to Norwegian PRV isolates were determined by phylogenetic analyses and sequence identity comparisons. Results: PRV is distantly related to members of the genera Orthoreovirus and Aquareovirus and an unambiguous new genus within the family Reoviridae. The Canadian and Norwegian PRV strains are most divergent in the segment S1 and S4 encoded proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of PRV S1 sequences, for which the largest number of complete sequences from different “isolates” is available, grouped Norwegian PRV strains into a single genotype, Genotype I, with sub-genotypes, Ia and Ib. The Canadian PRV strains matched sub-genotype Ia and Chilean PRV strains matched sub-genotype Ib. Conclusions: PRV should be considered as a member of a new genus within the family Reoviridae with two major Norwegian sub-genotypes. The Canadian PRV diverged from Norwegian sub-genotype Ia around 2007 ± 1, whereas the Chilean PRV diverged from Norwegian sub-genotype Ib around 2008 ± 1.

AB  - Interspecifi c hybrids are interesting in terms of evolutionary genetics as well as conservation genetics. Hybridization is an important factor of evolution: many animal species have originated through distant hybridization (reviews: Serebrovskiy, 1935; Dowling & Secor, 1997; Barton, 2001; Arnold & Burke, 2005; Mallet, 2007). However, the environmental impact of human activities may also promote hybridization (reviews: Allendorf et al., 2001; Levin, 2002; Seehausen et al., 2007). Interspecifi c hybridization is common for many fi shes, including salmonids (reviews: Day, 188889; Hubbs, 1955; Nikolyukin, 1972; Dangel et al., 1973; Chevassus, 1979; Schwartz, 1981; Verspoor & Hammar, 1991; Smith, 1992; Yakovlev et al., 2000; Scribner et al., 2001; Taylor, 2004). Possibly, the hybrid between the Atlantic salmon and brown trout was the fi rst hybrid fi sh ever to be described; natural hybridization of these species was mentioned by Willughbeii (1686). The Atlantic salmon and brown trout were hybridized artifi cially for the fi rst time as early as in the 19th century (Shaw, pers. comm., 1841 (cited by Day, 1888-89); Coste, 1853; Rouiller et al., 1858; Fatio, 1890). The hybridization between the Atlantic salmon and brown trout is a good model for studying the factors and consequences of interspecific hybridization. In addition, these fi shes are key components of water ecosystems of Northern Europe and popular objects of aquaculture and angling. This article is a review of published data on natural and artifi cial hybridization between these species.

AB  - We investigated the effects of an early boost of cortisol exposure in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs during fertilisation on subsequent behavioural responses when exposed to a sudden stimulus in larvae and juveniles. At 55 d post-fertilisation (dpf), treatment had no effect on high accelerations occurring after a sudden event. At 146 dpf, these high accelerations were more frequent in cortisol-treated fish than in controls. At 146 dpf also, swimming activity was increased in cortisol-treated fish both before and after the sudden stimulus. This study underlines the important behavioural modifications in both larvae and juveniles, linked to a change in the surrounding environment of the embryo. Indeed, fish exposed to cortisol as eggs showed a higher level of fearfulness later in life. Our findings are of major interest for stress management in an aquaculture context and also allow for a better understanding of the long-lasting effects of a permanent and/or acute stress – mediated by cortisol – that could be encountered by females, affecting population's life history trajectory.

In addition, the stomach contents of 909 returning adults caught in the fjord were examined to determine the extent to which, how recently and on what species they had fed. The tagged individuals migrated through surface waters and performed aperiodic dives, regardless of whether they were leaving the fjord as post-spawners (kelts) or returning after a winter or more at sea. However, diving behaviour differed between the fjord and outer coast. During both outward and return migration, dives when fish were likely in the fjord were shallower than on the outer coast. Deep dives of longer duration were more frequent on the outer coast than in the fjord. The stomach content analysis of salmon captured in the fjord did not show strong evidence of recent feeding: 58% of the salmon had empty stomachs, and most stomach contents were highly digested fish (mainly herring, but some capelin and unidentifiable species). We conclude that the inferred diving behaviour in the coastal zone, both on outward migration to sea and on return to the natal river, did not provide sufficient evidence of foraging within the water column, and hypothesize that diving in search for navigation cues is a more likely explanation.</jats:p>

AB  - Infectious bacterial pathogens are a concern for aquaculture as estimates suggest that billions of US dollars are lost annually in aquaculture due to disease. One of the most prevalent salmonid pathogens is the bacterium <i>Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i> that causes bacterial coldwater disease. We reviewed the published <i>F. psychrophilum</i> literature and conducted a Bayesian analysis to examine large-scale patterns in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) mortality associated with laboratory challenge. We incorporated factors that were common across a majority of the laboratory exposure studies and these included bacterial dose, culture time, exposure method, bacterial isolate, experimental duration, and fish weight. The comparison showed that injection as the exposure method produced higher mortality than bath immersion, bacterial isolates differed in their effect on mortality, and bacterial dose has an interactive effect with fish weight and exposure method. Our comparison allows for inference on factors affecting rainbow trout mortality due to exposure to <i>F. psychrophilum</i> and suggests avenues to further optimize research protocols to better reach study goals.

Lima1, Sergio Bexiga1 and Joana I. Robalo1 1 MARE/ISPA, Portugal 2 Carna Research Station, Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland, Ireland 3 Marine and Freshwater Research Centre, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Ireland The ballan wrasse, Labrus bergylta (Labridae), is a protogynous hermaphrodite fish common in the north-eastern Atlantic from Norway to Morocco. It is a commercially important resource for local fisheries and is currently being used as cleaner fish to control sea lice in salmon farms in northern Europe. We analysed the phylogeographic patterns of this species using mitochondrial (control region) and nuclear (I intron of the S7 gene) markers in populations throughout its distributional range. The results revealed a marked genetic structure of L. bergylta along the sampled area, with a major separation found between the Archipelago of the Azores and all remaining locations and also a clear separation between the north-eastern Atlantic and Scandinavian locations. Similarly to other temperate species the genetic diversity decreased from north-eastern Atlantic to Scandinavian populations. Haplotype networks confirm the distinctiveness of the population from the Azores and show that Scandinavian populations also present some distinct haplotypes. The phylogeographic pattern and diversity indices found for the ballan wrasse are discussed and compared with others found for different labrid species. The recognition of different populations of L. bergylta may be an in important result for fisheries management and also for future regulation of capture and translocation of specimens to be used as cleaners in aquaculture facilities.

AB  - Infestations by the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and amoebic gill disease (AGD) are currently significant disease concerns facing the Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry in Ireland. Increasing seawater temperatures, and the move away from chemotherapeutants has prompted a new approach to researching areas of host-parasite life histories and using the physiology and behaviour of the parasites to develop novel control methods. Freshwater, with a low ionic concentration can be used to control sea lice and AGD but this may not always be available. Alternative treatments with hydrogen peroxide can prove toxic at the higher summer water temperatures experienced at this latitude. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of using nano-filtered hyposaline water as a non-medicinal method to reduce sea lice (L. salmonis and Caligus elongatus) infestation levels and amoebic gill disease under commercial conditions on an Atlantic salmon farm. To achieve this salmon were bathed in a tarpaulin filled with 5 ppt hyposaline water for 4.5 h and a regime of prophylactic bath treatments put in place to follow the production cycle. The nano-filtration unit consistently produced low saline water and resulted in a significant reduction of sea lice levels and AGD following routine 4.5 h baths. A 4.5 h bioassay of detached salmon lice confirmed both hyposaline and freshwater were equally effective against L. salmonis in the absence of the host.

AB  - The consequences of slaughter on the formation of lipid metabolites and oxidative stability of fish muscle during long term frozen storage (-10 °C) were evaluated using farmed rainbow trout killed by asphyxia in air or percussion. The level of major adenine nucleotides and their related compounds was determined in order to check the stress level during slaughter. Plasma lipid metabolites were studied through the determination of eicosanoids and docosanoids such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, isoprostanes, resolvins, hydroxides, hydroperoxides, coming from eicosapentaenoic (EPA), arachidonic (ARA), and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. In addition, lipid oxidative stability of fillets was monitored. Results revealed that stress during slaughter can greatly influence oxidative stress and oxidative stability of rainbow trout fillets. In fact, asphyxia, which was the most stressful, induced a higher production of some lipid mediators such as hydroperoxides and EPA-derived prostaglandins, such as 12-HpHEPE/15-HpHEPE and PGD3/PGE3. As a consequence, fillets derived from asphyxiated fish were less stable in terms of oxidative stability and showed lower shelf-life.

AB  - Interceptory fisheries represent an ongoing threat to migratory fish stocks particularly when managed in the absence of stock specific catch and exploitation information. Atlantic salmon from the southern portion of the North American range may be subject to exploitation in the commercial and recreational salmon fisheries occurring in the French territorial waters surrounding St. Pierre and Miquelon off southern Newfoundland. We evaluated stock composition of Atlantic salmon harvested in the St. Pierre and Miquelon Atlantic salmon fishery using genetic mixture analysis and individual assignment with a microsatellite baseline (15 loci, 12,409 individuals, 12 regional groups) encompassing the species western Atlantic range. Individual salmon were sampled from the St. Pierre and Miquelon fishery over four years (2004, 2011, 2013, and 2014). Biological characteristics indicate significant variation among years in the size and age distribution. Nonetheless, estimates of stock composition of the samples showed consistent dominance of three regions (i.e., Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, Gaspe Peninsula, and Newfoundland). Together salmon from these regions accounted for more than 70% of annual harvest over the decade examined. Comparison of individual assignments and biological characteristics revealed a trend of declining fresh water age with latitude of assigned region. Moreover, locally harvested Newfoundland salmon were ten times more likely to be small or one sea winter individuals whereas Quebec and Gaspe Peninsula salmon were two-three times more likely to be harvested as large or two sea winter salmon. Estimates of region specific catch were highest for salmon from the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence region ranging from 242 to 887 individuals annually. This work illustrates how genetic analysis of interceptory marine fisheries can directly inform assessment and management efforts in highly migratory marine species.

AB  - This chapter discusses the factors affecting the quality of the fish muscle, focusing on nutrient composition, harvesting methods, and changes occurring during the rigor mortis process affecting flesh quality. Some fish species show seasonal changes in muscle lipid content and then the lipid content is exchanged with water, keeping the other nutrients more or less constant. Farmed fish are fed numerous variations in diet energy density, are subjected to changes in feeding rate, manipulations of the dietary compositions, and light regimes resulting in changed breeding season, all factors that might influence the nutritional and sensory quality of the fish flesh at harvest. Product tailoring is focused on production of fish meat that is to contain a pre-defined nutritional composition when harvested. Lipid rich farmed fish like the salmonids are relatively easy to tailor when it comes to lipid soluble nutrients, but much harder when considering the water soluble nutrients. The fact that protein composition in fish is determined by the genetic code and the fact that free amino acids cannot be stored as such, which means that the fillet protein cannot be tailored. A high flesh quality might be defined as a fish muscle containing nutrients that are health promoting for the consumer, and have the texture and taste required by consumers but concomitantly containing as little as possible of any harmful contaminants that might jeopardize human health. Further, processing and slaughter methods might affect the final quality of the harvested fish.

AB  - The status of harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, is reviewed for stocks in Oregon and Washington waters, and the adjacent transboundary waters of southern British Columbia, Canada, emphasizing the most recent data on their geographic range, population structure, distribution, population size, trends in abundance, and reproductive biology. This information is used to determine if the annual rate of incidental mortality and serious injury in gill-net fisheries from 1990-94 could be at a biologically significant level. In the eastern North Pacific Ocean, harbor porpoise are found near the coast, generally in water depths of less than 200 m. Differences in harbor porpoise mitochondrial DNA and organochlorine pollutant ratios and concentrations indicate that porpoise movements and intrinsic rates of mixing are sufficiently restricted to form geographically distinct groups, but not specific stock boundaries. Two harbor porpoise transboundary management areas, the Inland Washington Stock and the Oregon/Washington Coast Stock, are recommended because incidental takes of harbor porpoise occur in commercial sockeye salmon gill-net fisheries of inland Washington waters. The corrected 1990-91 best and minimum abundance estimates are N = 3,352 (CV(N) = 0.270) and Nmin = 2,680 for inland Washington/southern British Columbia, and N = 26,175 (CV(N) = 0.206) and Nmin = 22,049 for coastal Oregon/Washington. Except for Puget Sound, where a substantial decline in harbor porpoise abundance has occurred, there are no data to determine population trends in Oregon and Washington waters. The aerial survey data collected during the summer of 1990-91 for water depths less than 91 m (50 fathoms), indicated significant differences (z = 6.9, P<O.OOl) in harbor porpoise mean densities (1.7 animals/km and 0.5

AB  - This chapter presents a survey of the forms, origin and background of the current salmon fishing policies and legal position of the United States and Japan. The North Pacific Salmon Fisheries issue is one of true international proportions, involving Japan, the United States and to a lesser extent, Canada. The salmon are a highly, but not completely mobile natural resource which range across existing political boundaries into areas where unambiguous spatial sovereignty is difficult to maintain. Conflicts between national salmon fishing policies have been traditionally adjusted by legal means by international treaties, generally according to the wishes of the dominant power. Salmon involved in the dispute in the North Pacific Ocean are spawned and hatched in Asian and American waters. Commercial exploitation of salmon in Siberia and Alaska began at river mouths along the coasts. The convention obligates the signatory powers to carry out scientific research into all aspects concerned with salmon and their movements on the high seas.

AB  - Models of virulence evolution for horizontally transmitted parasites often assume that transmission rate (the probability that an infected host infects a susceptible host) and virulence (the increase in host mortality due to infection) are positively correlated, because higher rates of production of propagules may cause more damages to the host. However, empirical support for this assumption is scant and limited to microparasites. To fill this gap, we explored the relationships between parasite life history and virulence in the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, a horizontally transmitted copepod ectoparasite on Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. In the laboratory, we infected juvenile salmon hosts with equal doses of infective L. salmonis larvae and monitored parasite age at first reproduction, parasite fecundity, area of damage caused on the skin of the host, and host weight and length gain. We found that earlier onset of parasite reproduction was associated with higher parasite fecundity. Moreover, higher parasite fecundity (a proxy for transmission rate, as infection probability increases with higher numbers of parasite larvae released to the water) was associated with lower host weight gain (correlated with lower survival in juvenile salmon), supporting the presence of a virulence–transmission trade-off. Our results are relevant in the context of increasing intensive farming, where frequent anti-parasite drug use and increased host density may have selected for faster production of parasite transmission stages, via earlier reproduction and increased early fecundity. Our study highlights that salmon lice, therefore, are a good model for studying how human activity may affect the evolution of parasite virulence.

AB  - It is well established that a collapse or strong reduction of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) would substantially cool the northern high latitudes. Here we show that there is a possibility that such cooling could be amplified under deliberate CO<sub>2</sub> removal and result in a temporary undershoot of a targeted temperature level. We find this behaviour in Earth system models that show a strong AMOC decline in response to anthropogenic forcing. Idealized simulations of CO<sub>2</sub> removal with one of these models indicate that the timing of negative emissions relative to AMOC decline and recovery is key in setting the strength of the temporary cooling. We show that the pronounced temperature-fluctuations at high northern latitudes found in these simulations would entail considerable consequences for sea-ice and permafrost extent as well as for high latitude ecosystems.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Novel genome editing techniques allow for efficient and targeted improvement of aquaculture stock and might be a solution to solve challenges related to disease and environmental impacts. This review has retrieved the latest research on genome editing on aquacultured finfish species, exploring the technological progress and the scope. Genome editing has most often been used on Nile tilapia (<jats:italic>Oreochromis niloticus</jats:italic> Linnaeus), followed by Atlantic salmon <jats:italic>(Salmo salar</jats:italic> Linnaeus). More than half of the studies have focused on developing solutions for aquaculture challenges, while the rest can be characterized as basic research on fish genetics/physiology or technology development. Main traits researched are reproduction and development, growth, pigmentation, disease resistance, use of trans‐GFP and study of the omega‐3 metabolism, respectively. There is a certain correlation between the species identified and their commercial relevance, indicating the relevance of most studies for present challenges of aquaculture. Reviewing geographical origin of the research, China has been in the forefront (29 publications), followed by the United States (9) and Norway (7). The research seems not to be dependent on regulative conditions in the respective countries, but merely on the purpose and objectives for the use of genome editing technologies. Some technical barriers identified in the studies are presented together with solutions to overcome these‐off‐target effects, ancestral genome duplication and mosaicism in F0. One of the objectives for use is the contribution to a more sustainable aquaculture, where the most prominent issues are solutions that contribute to minimizing impact on biodiversity.</jats:p>

AB  - Increased commercial value of brown trout, Salmo trutta macrostigma has lead to its declined natural stock due to over exploitation, and thereby made it an endangered species. Cryopreservation of spermatogonial and oogonial stem cells may help in protecting this species. In this context, we have earlier isolated and cultured spermatogonial stem cells from male S.t. macrostigma. In this study, we report isolation and culture of oogonial stem cells from brown trout (S. t. macrostigma).In addition, bacterial contamination in oogonial cell culture media were identified and described. Wild females wereobtained from Kılıç Trout Fish Farm (Kahramanmaraş, Turkey). In order to identify the appropriate size, age and ovarystructure for oogonial stem cell isolation and culture, the ovary structure was morphologically and histologically studied.Fish were anesthetized with 0.04% 2-phenoxethanol. The ovary tissue were digested by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA.HBSS, with1.0 μg/mL NaHCO3, antibiotics were used to maintain cells in a viable stage. The concentration of cells was measured byhemocytometer. Antibiogram and Gram staining techniques were applied to the culture media contaminated with bacteria.Appropriate age, size and weight of trout for oogonial stem cell isolation and culture were identified as 7+ month old,14.6±1.6 cm, 28.2±7.7 g, respectively. The highest oogonial stem cells were measured in the perinucleolar stage of theovary. Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii were identified in the contaminated cell media. Density ofoogonial stem cells were measured as 5.4×105±2.6×105 cells/mL. In this study, germ cell isolation and culture technique wasdeveloped for S. t. macrostigma.

AB  - Dams, once considered by many to be good for water development in the Western U.S., might not be a part of a climate resilient future. Dams have come under increasing scrutiny due to undesirable ecological implications. Although dam removal proposals are growingly popular in recent decades, they are controversial since they impact different stakeholders in different ways. In the Pacific Northwest, the Lower four Snake River dams have long been criticized for their negative impacts on salmon. In February 2021, US Congressman Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) proposed a comprehensive framework to deconstruct the Lower four Snake River dams as an attempt to redesign Idahoâ€™s energy landscape, change transportation pathways, and address the seemingly endless salmon wars. Through a political ecology lens, I examine the factors that serve as drivers to alliance building or points of detachment from alliance building amongst stakeholders, including how each sector views legal methodologies, values nature, embraces their social responsibility, and envisions the regionâ€™s future under increasing climate change. I analyze 22 semi-structured interviews with a broad range of social actors such as advocacy groups, power administrators, farmers, and Indigenous leaders, and examine dominant discourses in 50 media documents from the rollout of Representative Simpsonâ€™s Columbia Basin Initiative to the delivery of President Bidenâ€™s Infrastructure Package in August 2021. As dam removal proposals arise globally, this critical examination of place-based water conflict illuminates how dam destruction may bring actors together in unanticipated and unprecedented ways.

AB  - The present authors report the first description of a bacterial disease, Varracalbmi, recorded sporadically among seawater-reared Atlantic salmon in northern Norway between 1989 and early 1992. The causative organism, a Gram-negative, non-motile, capsule-forming, oxidase-positive and facultatively anaerobic rod, has not previously been described. The mean water temperatures during the outbreaks varied from 2.5 to 8 °C. The disease was characterized by haemorrhagic and necrotizing pyogranulomatous inflammation which targeted the eye and resulted in panophthalmitis. Accompanying lesions included deep dermal ulcerations, necrotizing and haemorrhagic pyogranulomatous lesions in the visceral organs, and necrosis of the pseudobranch. The proposed name of the disease, Varracalbmi, is the Lappish name for ‘bloody eye’.

AB  - RESUME: Les stocks de saumon atlantique (Salmo salar L.) se sont effondres au debut des annees 1990 en reponse a une combinaison de facteurs incluant la surpeche. Jusqu’a maintenant, peu de stocks ont presente des signes de retablissement malgre la fermeture de la majorite des peches commerciales et la mise en place de mesures de gestion visant a reduire les captures accidentelles par d’autres peches. Des etudes suggerent que les faibles niveaux actuels d’abondance des stocks de saumon atlantique seraient le resultat d’une hausse de la mortalite naturelle en mer causee par une diminution de la croissance. A cet egard, l’objectif de la presente etude est de verifier, pour la premiere fois pour les saumons d’une riviere du Quebec, si la croissance marine de ces saumons a diminue au cours des dernieres annees. Pour repondre a cet objectif, des indices de croissance ont ete calcules a partir de mesures scalimetriques incluant le nombre de circuli et la distance intercirculi. Les ecailles a analyser ont ete tirees de la collection historique de la riviere Matane. Cette collection, qui debute en 1965, est l’une des plus importantes au Quebec. Les resultats indiquent que les indices de croissance presentent des differences annuelles significatives qui sont accompagnees d’une tendance a la hausse entre 1963 et 1979, et d’une tendance a la baisse du milieu des annees 1990 jusqu’au debut des annees 2010. Ces tendances sont tres similaires au patron dominant de l’indice de l’oscillation nord-atlantique (IONA) ce qui suggere que la baisse de croissance mesuree chez les saumons de la riviere Matane serait associee a une hausse de la temperature de l’eau. Les resultats demontrent egalement que la croissance realisee entre juillet et octobre de chaque annee passee en mer supporte l’hypothese de l’atteinte d’une longueur automnale minimale permettant de repondre adequatement aux demandes metaboliques de l’hiver. Aucune relation n’est mesuree entre la croissance et les retours en riviere. Cette absence de relation suggere la presence d’autres facteurs de mortalite affectant les saumons de la riviere Matane. Ces resultats mettent en valeur le role de l’environnement dans la croissance marine du saumon atlantique. Ils representent egalement une premiere etape vers une meilleure comprehension des mecanismes affectant le recrutement de cette espece pour une riviere du Quebec. -- Mot(s) cle(s) en francais : Saumon atlantique, mortalite naturelle, croissance, circuli, distance intercirculi, indice de l’oscillation nord-atlantique, recrutement. -- ABSTRACT: The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) stocks collapsed in the early 1990s owing to a combination of factors including overfishing. Until now, few stocks have shown signs of recovery despite the closure of the majority of the commercial fisheries and the implementation of management measures to reduce the by-catches by other fisheries. Studies suggest that the current low levels of abundance of the Atlantic salmon stocks would be the result of an increase in the natural mortality at sea caused by a reduction in growth. In this regard, the objective of this study is to verify, for the first time for the salmons of a Quebec river, if the marine growth of these salmons has decreased in recent years. To meet this objective, growth indices were calculated from scalimetric measurements including the number of circuli and the inter-circuli distance. The scales to be analyzed were taken from the historical collection of the Matane River. This collection that dates back to 1965 is one of the most important in Quebec. The results indicate that the growth indices show significant annual differences that are accompanied by an upward trend between 1963 and 1979, and a downward trend from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. These trends are very similar to the dominant pattern of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) suggesting that the reduction in growth of the Matane River salmons is associated with an increase in water temperature. The results also sho that the growth achieved between July and October of each year spent at sea supports the hypothesis of reaching a minimum autumn length to adequately meet the metabolic demands of winter. No relationship is measured between growth and the river returns. This lack of relationship suggests the presence of other mortality factors affecting the salmons of the Matane River. These results highlight the role of the environment in the marine growth of the Atlantic salmon. They also represent a first step towards a better understanding of the mechanisms affecting the recruitment of this species for a Quebec river. -- Mot(s) cle(s) en anglais : Atlantic salmon, natural mortality, growth, circuli, inter-circuli distance, North Atlantic Oscillation Index, recruitment.

Their performance was compared with similarly reared batches of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri). This work shows that American brook trout require more care and attention than rainbow trout when reared artificially and that their survival to 1 year old is lower, although growth rate in the first year compares favourably.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Given the importance of gut microbiota for health, growth and performance of the host, the aquaculture industry has taken measures to develop functional fish feeds aiming at modulating gut microbiota and inducing the anticipated beneficial effects. However, present understanding of the impact of such functional feeds on the fish is limited. The study reported herein was conducted to gain knowledge on performance and gut health characteristics in post-smolt Atlantic salmon fed diets varying in content of functional ingredients. Three experimental diets, a diet containing fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), a diet with a combination of FOS and Pediococcus acidilactici (BC) and a diet containing galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and BC, were used in a 10-weeks feeding trial. A commercial diet without functional ingredients was also included as a control/reference. Samples of blood plasma, mucosa and digesta were subjected to microbiota, transcriptome and metabolome profiling for evaluation of the diet effects.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">No significant growth differences were observed between fish fed the supplemented diets, but FOS-BC fed fish showed significantly faster growth than the control fed fish. The microbiota results showed that the BC was present in both the digesta, and the mucosa samples of fish fed the FOS-BC and GOS-BC diets. Digesta-associated microbiota was altered, while mucosa-associated microbiota was relatively unaffected by diet. Replacing FOS with GOS increased the level of metabolites linked to phospholipid, fatty acid, carnitine and sphingolipid metabolism. Variation in metabolite levels between the treatments closely correlated with genera mainly belonging to Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla. The transcriptome analyses indicated diet effects of exchanging FOS with GOS on immune functions, oxidative defense and stress responses. No significant diet effect was observed on intestinal inflammation in the pyloric caeca or in the distal intestine, or on lipid accumulation in the pyloric caeca.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Dietary supplementation with BC induced moderate effects on the microbiota of the digesta, while the effects of replacing FOS with GOS were more marked and was observed also for nutrient metabolism. Our data indicates therefore that the quality of a prebiotic may be of great importance for the effects of a probiotic on gut microbiota, function, and health.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.

AB  - Atlantic salmon fish farming has become a large industry worldwide. The industry's processes are examined, and the farming stages analyzed. Fish Farming Industry Simulation Model (FFISiM), a hierarchical, colored Petri net simulation model, was developed to simulate Atlantic salmon fish farming industry. The model simulates different companies' situations in the fish farming industry. Because the model is implemented in a hierarchical structure, it is easy to scale the model for future simulations, and refinements can be implemented in all levels of the model. Several possibilities for refinement and sub model development are proposed based on existing models or ongoing research areas. The FFISiM Seawater sub model is implemented in GPenSIM under MATLAB environment. Simulation of several cases from the fish farming industry with the seawater sub model show convincing results, and indicate that the model is well suited for simulating different situation that could occur in the Atlantic salmon fish farming industry.

AB  - The arthropod salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is a major threat to Atlantic salmon aquaculture and wild salmonids. Essentially like in monoculture, very high concentrations of susceptible hosts may result in high reproduction and severe production of waves of pests. Pest management is crucial both for fish health and protection of wild fish populations from aquaculture influence. Various methods have been utilized to control salmon lice infestations, such as pesticide use, physical treatments, construction modifications, fallowing, breeding, vaccination, and biological control. Most of the methods are partially successful, but none completely fulfills the necessary pest control strategy. Like in agriculture, lice/pest management is an arms race, but the marine environment makes it even more difficult to precisely hit the target pest and avoid unintended negative effects on general wildlife. In this study, we provide an overview of the methods and principles of salmon lice management and address current possibilities and limitations. We also highlight the potential of emerging strategies and enabling technologies, like genome editing, RNA interference, and machine learning, in arthropod management in aquaculture.

AB  - In general, the well-being of aquatic ecosystems is a key parameter reflecting ecosystem wealth. To avoid negative influences on fish physiology, the stress state of species must be monitored. β- d -glucose level is one of the key indicators of acute stress in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles and has been associated with different environmental conditions, including different amounts of chemicals. In the present study, we explore the possibility of assessing the β- d -glucose level in water as a reliable indicator of acute stress in the fish exposed to chemical contaminants. Amperometric biosensor utilizing immobilized into membrane glucose oxidase Aspergillus niger (GOx) for the measurement of low concentration of β- d -glucose in fish holding water was developed and described. Specific layers of the enzymatic membrane allowed to eliminate interfering signals and the biosensor have been fitted for β- d -glucose measurements in fish-holding water. Besides that, the biosensor exhibited several advantageous functional properties, i.e. a wide linear range (0.005–30 mM), high sensitivity (1.07 ± 0.01 µA mM-1cm−2), good selectivity and long-term stability. It was the combination of these biosensor properties that made the simultaneous measurement of β- d -glucose both at low (in water) and high (in fish blood) concentrations and operating in non-pretreated turbid media feasible. Fish were exposed to the primary complex metal (Zn – 0.1, Cu – 0.01, Cd – 0.0015, Ni – 0.034, Pb – 0.014 and Cr – 0.01 mg·L−1, respectively) mixture (MIX) (prepared at maximum-permissible-concentrations for inland waters in European Union (EU)) and MIX5↓ (5-fold reduced (↓) concentration of each metal in the mixture). The obtained results revealed that the blood-glucose level in fish did not change over time significantly, while the level of β- d -glucose released into water by the fish after 3 h exposure to MIX was found to have significantly increased. However, potential stress was observed in the fish exposed to both MIX and MIX5↓ metal mixtures revealing fish sensitivity and proving suitability of the glucose measurement procedure. No significant relationship was found to exist between blood-glucose and water β- d -glucose levels. The results showed that in contrast to blood-glucose measurements, the proposed non-invasive measurement of β- d -glucose in water was beneficial. Thus, this study provides a new approach for the development of a method for stress indication in fish using the measurement of glucose in holding water. Moreover, this glucose measurement procedure can prove to be another valuable tool for stress evaluation method in aquaculture, fish welfare and toxicological research, especially for studying short-term stress responses induced by chemicals.

AB  - Effective marine monitoring and conservation efforts are urgently needed because anthropogenic pressures such as overfishing, habitat damage, pollution and invasive species are increasing (Laffoley et al., 2022). Public engagement activities can enhance marine monitoring efforts, providing valuable observations and increasing ocean literacy in society (Boaventura et al., 2021). Sharing knowledge about marine wildlife in accessible ways, such as digital media and at interactive workshops, can greatly increase the involvement of people in protecting their local environment. Marine citizen science is growing globally (Garcia-Soto et al., 2021; Kelly et al., 2020) ranging from specific environmental issues (e.g. plastic pollution; Rambonnet et al., 2019), habitat protection (e.g. seagrass meadows; Smale et al., 2019) or a focus on certain taxa (such as seaweeds; Brodie et al., 2023). Most UK marine citizen science initiatives have been driven by non-governmental organizations (Garcia-Soto et al., 2021). Examples include Project Seagrass, a Welsh University-led organization that combines research, public involvement and outreach activities to share seagrass knowledge and restore seagrass meadows (www.projectseagrass.org). More than 800,000 habitat and species observations have been reported to the UK National Biodiversity Network by Seasearch. This group of SCUBA divers and snorkelers are trained by the Marine Conservation Society and have been collecting data for marine conservation since 1988, greatly expanding the known distribution of maerl (www.seasearch.org.uk). Seasearch maerl data were used to inform the design of a network of Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Seasearch continues to build a database with maerl distribution records to inform future conservation and management initiatives and is working with Natural England to help improving maerl habitat classification (Angus Jackson, pers. comm.). Maerl is a seabed habitat made up of coralline algae thalli that grow unattached to substrata (Figure 1). Maerl habitats occur worldwide and have high ecological, socio-economic and cultural value but are far less well known or studied than habitats such as coral reefs, kelp forests or seagrass beds (Tuya et al., 2023). This habitat harbours high biodiversity and provides nursery areas for commercially valuable species such as cod and scallops and spawning areas for herring (Hall-Spencer, 2023). Scottish Natural Heritage (now called NatureScot; www.nature.scot) funded a workshop which drew together researchers from Europe and North and South America (Donnan & Moore, 2003) who noted that maerl is particularly sensitive to physical disturbance such as towed demersal gear impacts, it is now known to also be sensitive to fish farm wastes (Hall-Spencer, 2023). In a region where maerl was being heavily damaged by scallop dredging (Hall-Spencer & Moore, 2000), the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) paved the way in establishing Scotland's first No Take Zone in 2008 to protect maerl. Local divers and COAST worked alongside academic scientists to monitor the seabed recovery that occurred after scallop dredging was stopped, sending the clear message that citizen science can help change policy and improve the marine environment (Stewart et al., 2020). Maerl is now a Priority Marine Feature in Scotland and is on the OSPAR list of threatened and declining species and habitats. It is an Annex 1 habitat in the EU Habitats Directive and is on the European Red List of endangered and threatened habitats (Perry & Tyler-Walters, 2023). Donnan & Moore (2003) provided a scientific basis for the establishment of a tranche of SAC and MPAs with maerl listed as a Priority Marine Feature (Table 1 and Figure 2). These lines on maps drawn by government are now being used by citizens and community groups to monitor the protected areas and call for stricter controls on illegal or damaging activities, and a Priority Marine Feature review by NatureScot is ongoing to try to improve protection given to maerl out ide the network of named protected areas. Founded in 2015, the Blue Hope Alliance (BHA) is a coalition of groups and people interested in protecting marine ecosystems and biodiversity in northwest Scotland, with a special focus on maerl (www.bluehopealliance.co.uk). It was created due to growing concern about illegal scallop dredging and the expansion of fish farms in the Wester Ross Marine Protected Area, the largest maerl protected area in the world (Baker et al., 2023). The groups include the Scottish Creel Fishermen's Federation, North and West District Salmon Fishery Board, Sea Change Wester Ross, Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board and SubSea TV. The alliance is supported by a scientific advisory group and has volunteer anglers, Marine Conservation Society Seasearch divers and snorkelers, scallop divers, underwater photographers, recreational divers and community coordinators with experience of journalism, storytelling, filmmaking and artistry (Baker et al., 2023). In total, around 70–80 volunteers are involved in the work at different levels, with, for example, cooking during surveys, diving, arranging public arrangements or maintaining or lending equipment (Sara Nason, pers. comm.). After illegal scallop dredging within the Wester Ross MPA was reported in 2019 by local fishermen to Alasdair Hughson, member of the Scottish Creel Fishermen's Federation and one of the founders of BHA, volunteers from BHA documented damage from the dredging and presented the video and photo material as evidence in court, together with a witness testimony of A. Hughson (Sara Nason, pers. comm.). The skipper in charge of the fishing vessel was later fined £3211 (COPFS – Crown Office & Procurator Fiscal Service, 2022). This case highlights that engaged local people can record and quickly report illegal damaging activities to the authorities, thereby protecting the fragile habitats contained in the marine ecosystem. The BHA coalition has been surveying, observing change and communicating the need to protect the marine environment with SCUBA diving fixed transect maerl surveillance since 2018 to follow alterations in the structure and abundance of the maerl beds over time. These data are openly available on the BHA web page, and it can also be found at NatureScot. The survey locations are concentrated around the Summer Isles, Loch Broom, Loch Carron and Loch Ewe (MPA 3 and 4; Figure 2). Voluntary divers from BHA have extended the known maerl habitat distribution around the Summer Isles, and they have recorded new marine species for the geographical area (the red speckled anemone Anthopleura ballii and the sea slug Placida dendritica) as well as the critically endangered flapper skate Dipturus intermedius. Another intriguing discovery is that flame shell (Limaria hians) nests seem to be spreading and smothering several maerl beds in the region, so transects have been set up by BHA members to monitor the situation. A Sea Change Wester Ross group submitted a protest to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) against establishment of a new fish farm at Horse Island. The SEPA outcome gave the farmers a Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations (CAR) license; however, the farming has not yet started. The BHA transects might prove useful to follow maerl status before and after farm establishment. The BHA strives to increase ocean literacy by arranging public events showcasing films about the importance of maerl (Baker et al., 2023). The BHA is also supporting emerging groups, Maerl Friends of Loch Torridon and groups in Loch Ewe and Applecross, focusing on maerl conservation with knowledge sharing, survey protocols and scientific advice to create linkages and joint efforts in protecting maerl (Sara Nason, pers. comm.). In conclusion, citizen science and community engagement by COAST and the BHA have managed to (i) increase knowledge of maerl abundance and status, (ii) monitor maerl habitats over time, (iii) promote maerl importance in political discussions, (iv) document and report illegal activities dam ging maerl and (v) promote public awareness and engagement within the local and wider public. These examples demonstrate the importance of volunteer organizations for maerl conservation that could be applied elsewhere where maerl is at threat such as in Iceland from gravel extraction and Brazil from oil spills (Tuya et al., 2023). They show how public engagement can aid maerl conservation by gathering a diverse group of people with different skill sets, with efforts made to translate essential scientific evidence into key messages that speak well to policymakers and public. Local environmental activists can feel that this is a 'David against Goliath' task but are prepared to stand up to corporate power, persist in the face of slow decision making and feel rewarded when destructive practices abate.

AB  - The role of the larva of the alder fly Sialis lutaria as a host for Neoechinorhynchus rutili (Acanthocephala) has been investigated. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) infected with N. rutili were found to be feeding on S. lutaria larvae which contained juvenile acanthocephalans in their haemocoels. These acanthocephalans have been identified as N. rutili. A previous report of this host-parasite relationship indicated some form of host response to the larval acanthocephalan. Stained wax sections of S. lutaria larvae infected with N. rutili did not show any evidence of either a host response or encapsulation. Samples of S. lutaria larvae revealed an interesting pattern of infection. Only larvae of a particular size range were infected. An experiment to infect commercially obtained rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) with N. rutili by feeding them with infected S. lutaria larvae was successful. Since S. lutaria larvae are known to be prey items for trout it appears that this route of infection could commonly occur in the natural environment. Larval S. lutaria is considered as an additional intermediate host to several ostracod species which have been shown to play a role in the transmission of N. rutili.

AB  - In 2019, it was estimated that more than 50 million captive Atlantic salmon in Norway died in the final stage of their production in marine cages. This mortality represents a significant economic loss for producers and a need to improve welfare for farmed salmon. Single adverse events, such as algal blooms or infectious disease outbreaks, can explain mass mortality in salmon cages. However, little is known about the production, health, or environmental factors that contribute to their baseline mortality during the sea phase. Here we conducted a retrospective study including 1627 Atlantic salmon cohorts put to sea in 2014-2019. We found that sea lice treatments were associated with Atlantic salmon mortality. In particular, the trend towards non-medicinal sea lice treatments, including thermal delousing, increases Atlantic salmon mortality in the same month the treatment is applied. There were differences in mortality among production zones. Stocking month and weight were other important factors, with the lowest mortality in smaller salmon stocked in August-October. Sea surface temperature and salinity also influenced Atlantic salmon mortality. Knowledge of what affects baseline mortality in Norwegian aquaculture can be used as part of syndromic surveillance and to inform salmon producers on farming practices that can reduce mortality.

AB  - The salmon farming industry is shifting from an entrepreneurial spirit towards industrialization and cost efficiency. Large players are purchasing the small players, and the industry is consolidating. Optimization is therefore becoming more relevant, but little academic work has been done on the freshwater part of the value chain. This thesis presents a linear stochastic programming model that minimizes the total expected costs related to smolt production. One of its innovations is a linear formulation using SOS2, enabling water temperature to be a decision variable. The main uncertainty, freshwater intake temperature, is modeled through the use of scenarios,which were generated using a seasonal AR(1)-model. Testing and feedback sessions with biologists were conducted to ensure model quality. The model was applied to two case studies involving the Marine Harvest freshwater facility at Slordal, Sor-Trondelag. The first case investigates a typical two year production plan, while the other explores the production of 500 grams smolts, which is a new product. These case studies have yielded three core insights. First, they indicate that optimization can have a significant impact on the total costs. A typical two year production plan at the Slordal facility experienced a total cost reduction of 11%. Second, smolt orders can be fulfilled with reduced water heating compared to today?s praxis if the fry are deployed earlier. Third, 500 grams smolt should be delivered during the winter to exploit the natural temperature seasonalities. Smolt delivered during the winter has significantly lower cost and production time compared to other seasons.

AB  - Biotelemetry is a powerful instrument for monitoring aquatic species in their natural environment. Using telemetry, animals can be monitored from a passive perspective, without the biases associated with conventional handling and sampling techniques. To monitor aquatic species in remote environments, with vast stretches of water, and in situations requiring both acoustic and radio transmissions (e.g. for diadromous fish), advances in telemetry are necessary. In this paper, a field-proven telemetry system based on a radio receiver and incorporating combined acoustic and radio smart transmitters, wireless hydrophones and two-way satellite communications is described. The system was first deployed in Bay d’Espoir, Newfoundland, Canada, in 1998. The purpose of this deployment was to determine whether aquaculture triploid steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) (1.5–2.0 kg), experimentally released in the vicinity of a commercial aquaculture site, remained at the site (site fidelity) or dispersed. Two sets of fish releases, summer and winter, were performed to determine seasonal effects on the movement of aquaculture triploid steelhead trout in the wild. The results suggested strong site fidelity among steelhead trout when released during the growing season (summer). However, less fidelity was displayed for the winter released steelhead.
