AB  - AbstractWe present a multi-stage stochastic programming formulation for the long-term production planning problem of a salmon farmer. Uncertainty in prices, growth and mortality is included in the model formulation, but we mainly focus on modeling the growth and development of the biomass in this paper. The planning horizon is 4–5 years, spanning approximately 3 life cycles of releasing smolt and slaughtering salmon. The objective is to maximize the expected profits from farming salmon, with the main decisions being both the timing and the quantity of releasing smolt and selling salmon. This chapter focuses on the description of the stochastic model and important factors for the modelling. Further work will focus more on computations and analysis.

AB  - Our previous studies showed that particular antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were enriched locally in sediments below fish farms in the Northern Baltic Sea, Finland, even when the selection pressure from antibiotics was negligible. We assumed that a constant influx of farmed fish feces could be the plausible source of the ARGs enriched in the farm sediments. In the present study, we analyzed the composition of the antibiotic resistome from the intestinal contents of 20 fish from the Baltic Sea farms. We used a high-throughput method, WaferGen qPCR array with 364 primer sets to detect and quantify ARGs, mobile genetic elements, and the 16S rRNA gene. Despite a considerably wide selection of qPCR primer sets, only 28 genes were detected in the intestinal contents. The detected genes were ARGs encoding resistance to sulfonamide (sul1), trimethoprim (dfrA1), tetracycline (tet(32), tetM, tetO, tetW), aminoglycoside (aadA1, aadA2), chloramphenicol (catA1), and efflux-pumps resistance genes (emrB, matA, mefA, msrA). The detected genes also included class 1 integron-associated genes (intI1, qacE∆1) and transposases (tnpA). Importantly, most of the detected genes were the same genes enriched in the farm sediments. This preliminary study suggests that feces from farmed fish contribute to the ARG enrichment in farm sediments despite the lack of contemporaneous antibiotic treatments at the farms. We observed that the intestinal contents of individual farmed fish had their own resistome compositions. Our result also showed that the total relative abundances of transposases and tet genes were significantly correlated (p-value = 0.001, R2 = 0.71). In addition, we analyzed the mucosal skin and gill filament resistomes of the farmed fish but only one multidrug-efflux resistance gene (emrB) was detected. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the resistome of farmed fish using a culture-independent method. Determining the possible sources of ARGs, especially mobilized ARGs, is essential for controlling the occurrence and spread of ARGs at fish farming facilities and for lowering the risk of ARG spread from the farms to surrounding environments.

AB  - The Red-faced Lovebird is a very pretty little bird that inhabits much of equatorial Africa. In fact, the Red-faced and the Black-collared Lovebirds have the largest range of any of the species. There are two subspecies, and I believe I have had both, howeverthe difference is slight, being a variation of the rump feathers. The nominate subspecies, Agapornis pullaria pullaria, is from West and Central Africa. The subspecies ugandaeis from Uganda and allegedly northeast Tanzania. It is not known if the two overlap. The Red-faced Lovebird is sexually dimorphic with the male being brighter in color in the face. The facial color of the females varies, and even changes during the breeding season. One of the most attractive features is that the body color is very bright "apple" green, not the olive or dark greens of the Peachfaced or eye-ring species. As mentioned, the rump is a bright blue. The bill is red. The Red-faced has been imported into the United States somewhat infrequently. It was certainly one of the first species to arrive here, elating back to the thirties, however for reasons I will discuss later, never became established. At least two dealers have imported them since the start of quarantine, however, the last birds to my knowledge arrived about two years ago in Chicago and there have been none brought in since. Because they are poor breeders, and there are not established domestic strains, this could mean the encl of their presence in American aviculture. As with the other sexually dimorphic species (the Madagascar and Abyssinian Lovebirds), the females are the most aggressive of the sexes. Sigie Meyer of SE BIRD AND SUPPLY told me he kept them apart in quarantine because of this. Their dietary requirements are not particularly unusual, however l would not call them great eaters. Small seeds form the basis of the diet l feed (I use a Kaytee Mix). They do not eat sunflower or safflower here. They do like apple and will eat some greens. However, all my lovebirds relish a Kaycee soak and cook mixture I prepare daily and mix with vegetables, but the Red-faced will not touch it. In a mixed aviary with finches (although they are sometimes aggressive with each other, they are not aggressive with other birds and can be maintained in a community flight - do not try this with any other lovebird1), they ate meal worms. I compared the diet of my birds with that of several other aviculturists working with the species. One breeder told me her birds ate cranberries. Her birds also ate legumes and rice, which, as mentioned, mine will not touch after a year of trying. At the San Diego Zoo where there is a number of these birds, I think most of the "soft" foods are eaten by other aviary inhabitants and the Redfaced Lovebirds still feed mostly on Kaytee small hookbill mix. Still, the major problem with the Redfaced Lovebirds is not that they won't eat. The problem is that it is ve1y difficult to get them interested in breeding. Success has occurred occasionally, however it is hard to look at these cases as other than isolated events. In order to understand this lovebird's uniqueness, let us look at the natural history of the bird. ln the wild the birds nest in arboreal termite mounds. They tunnel the nests straight in, then down and to the right to form a completely darkened nest chamber about the size of an orange. The nest itself is warmed by the heat generated by the insects inside, and must certainly provide a warm comfortable brooder for the hatchling birds when the parents go off to feed. So as breeders began to work with this species, we had to become creative in what we offered the birds to entice them to nest. One breeder in South Africa offered an actual termite mound he collected himself and raised the birds successfully. In the United States this is not a practical alternative. Various types of boxes have been designed, some packed with cork, some with compressed peat, and here in the United States one breeder packed a box with dried grass. There has been success in a plain Budgie box, which somewhat proves my th ory that if a bird wants to nest bad enough, it will even under less than perfect conditions. I hope not to offend anyone by saying that I think some successes came through the "luck" of owning an exceptional pair. My new nest boxes this year (my latest design) are rectangular in shape with PVC spout lined with rolled cork. The birds must tunnel through the cork to get to the box, which is also lined with cork and filled with compressed peat. The new and improved model will have a false bottom which could hold a small reptile heater that could be turned on after chicks hatch to maintain a high brood temperature. Well this year I got further than I have ever before with the Red-faced. Two pairs from two completely different sources went to nest in the late fall of 1993. They tunneled through the 2 1/2 in. PVC cork-filled spout and started to tunnel downward into the peat. I might note here that I would much prefer a solid block of cork to the peat, but have never been able to find it. European breeders have had success with the cork. For the first time ever, I observed pairs not only feeding but copulating as well, so I felt I was on the right track. Then on January 17th, at 4:30 in the morning I, as well as my birds, were awakened by a major earthquake epicentered about five miles from my ranch. That was the end of the breeding season for the rare birds. I might add that one pair was kept in a 12 ft. aviary, while the other was kept in a 4 ft. breeding cage, and the results were the same. In speaking with two breeders in the African Love Bird Society who have been successful in the last two years, I offer these accounts. Jackie Eckman of Baltimore, Maryland provided a custom nest box, a small Budgie box lined with half inch sheets of cork. The box was not filled, only lined. The birds were kept in Safeguard stackable cages 18 in. square. The pair of Red-faced was on top with a Boston fern for privacy. The nest box went up in November and was investigated by the parents. At this time the female was noticeably paler in the face and feathers on the nape were smutty or brownish, just before nesting commenced (I have noticed this on my birds, as well as on the birds at the San Diego Zoo). Jackie observed the male feeding the hen but did not inspect the nest for two weeks or so. At that time there were two eggs and a week later four. She candled the eggs and all were fertile. After about 20 days she heard peeping from the nest and inspected, whereby the normally steady parents panicked and ultimately two babies were killed. One baby was pulled at four weeks and handfed, with the other left with the parents. Both offspring (males) were raised successfully, Jackie told me that black pinfeathers on the wings of the males are discernible very early. Thus sexing is possible in the nest. Marilena Salmones of Plano, Texas raised three Red-faced. She also raised the birds in relatively small cages and emphasized that the birds are place high up to give them a sense of privacy and security. She also reported the change in the color of the nape of the female. Her nest box was packed with sun-dried grass. She also cautions against interference of any kind. Marilena raised females. If second generation birds were exchanged by breeders like Jackie and Marilena, we would, hopefully, in subsequent nests see some of the shyness and specialization bred out of these birds. The Hooded Parakeet of Australia, also a termite-nester and once considered very difficult, is now established. We do not have very many Red-faced Lovebirds left and they will probably die out. This species was virtually absent from aviculture for many years prior to quarantine. The only known specimens were two males I owned (which were lent to the San Diego Zoo and the· source of many of the photographs published of the species) and a few imported by Lee Horton which did not thrive. In fact in the seventies, I finally gave Horton my only remaining male to mate with his only remaining hen. They did nest in a palm log, tunneling and even laying fertile eggs, but none were su cessfully raised. Thus, I don't really see much hope of establishing the Redfaced at this time. If we ever· receive any more importations of wild caught birds (they are in no way endangered in the wild), we need to be more prudent in trying to establish a self-sustaining domestic strain.

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector worldwide, mostly driven by a steadily increasing protein demand. In response to growing ecological concerns, life cycle assessment (LCA) emerged as a key environmental tool to measure the impacts of various production systems, including aquaculture. In this review, we focused on farmed salmonids to perform an in-depth analysis, investigating methodologies and comparing results of LCA studies of this finfish family in relation to species and production technologies. Identifying the environmental strengths and weaknesses of salmonid production technologies is central to ensure that industrial actors and policymakers make informed choices to take the production of this important marine livestock to a more sustainable path. Three critical aspects of salmonid LCAs were studied based on 24 articles and reports: (1) Methodological application, (2) construction of inventories, and (3) comparison of production technologies across studies. Our first assessment provides an overview and compares important methodological choices. The second analysis maps the main foreground and background data sources, as well as the state of process inclusion and exclusion. In the third section, a first attempt to compare life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) data across production technologies was conducted using a single factor statistical protocol. Overall, findings suggested a lack of methodological completeness and reporting in the literature and demonstrated that inventories suffered from incomplete description and partial disclosure. Our attempt to compare LCA results across studies was challenging due to confounding factors and poor data availability, but useful as a first step in highlighting the importance of production technology for salmonids. In groups where the data was robust enough for statistical comparison, both differences and mean equalities were identified, allowing ranking of technology clusters based on their average scores. We statistically demonstrated that sea-based systems outperform land-based technology in terms of energy demand and that sea-based systems have a generally higher FCR than land-based ones. Cross-study analytics also strongly suggest that open systems generate on average more eutrophying emissions than closed designs. We further discuss how to overcome bottlenecks currently hampering such LCA meta-analysis. Arguments are made in favor of further developing cross-study LCA analysis, particularly by increasing the number of salmonid LCA available (to improve sample sizes) and by reforming in-depth LCA practices to enable full reproducibility and greater access to inventory data.

AB  - During the last 25 years, aquaculture production has changed from a minor, relatively unimportant contributor to the world’s seafood supply (about 7% in 1975) to constituting about one-third of supply in 2000 (FAO 2002). This has, of course, changed seafood consumption patterns substantially, and therefore, market structure. An implication of this development is that aquaculture production, in many cases, cannot be ignored if one is interested in the functioning of seafood markets. This is true even in the case of fishery regulations. For instance, salmon and sea bass provide prime examples of how growth in aquaculture production leads to price reduction and a very different market environment for the fishermen that target these species. As noted by Anderson (2002, this issue), the distinction between a fishery and aquaculture depends, to a large extent, on the degree of control over the production process. This depends both on the migration of the stock in question and the degree of property rights. Hence, an ITQ system is closer to aquaculture than an open-access system. The distinction between a fishery and aquaculture then becomes very blurred for quite a few species, such as mussels, scallops, etc. These species, in principle, are wild and, in most cases, the breeding process is not controlled. However, when fishermen have use rights to a particular oyster bank, for example, and attempt to make the bank more productive, this is basically considered extensive aquaculture, having a number of similarities to traditional oyster aquaculture in China or France. As one gains increasing control over the production process, including breeding and feeding, aquaculture becomes more intensive and industrialized. To what extent the production process can be controlled is important with respect to planning, and thereby influences the timing and the quality of the product sold. The increased degree of control over the production process for aquaculture products has led to interest in a number of new research topics relating to seafood products on both the production and market sides, since this control enables producers to influence more parameters than in the traditional fishery. However, as new regulatory tools give fishermen increased control over their harvest, many of these topics are or will become important in studies of traditional fisheries. Moreover, their importance is likely to increase as the competition between wild and farmed seafood intensifies, and as market requirements become similar for captured and farmed seafood (e.g., in the form of ecolabels).

AB  - Dietary inclusion of canthaxanthin, a common carotenoid pigment, has been long practiced in aquaculture to give the favorable flesh color in farmed salmonids. However, carotenoids are associated with limited solubility and poor physicochemical stability, and their dose in fish feed is widely regulated. In this study, we included canthaxanthin- and α-tocopherol-loaded liposomes into fish diets and evaluated the effects of supplemented fish feed on fish growth, color, nutrition, and canthaxanthin deposition in fillets of cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The liposomes were fabricated using lecithin as phospholipids with the initial concentrations (IC = mcanthaxanthin/mlipids, % wt/wt) of canthaxanthin at 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%. Particle size characterization showed that liposome mean sizes were 109.70 ± 6.36, 105.10 ± 8.41, and 109.20 ± 5.66 nm (mean ± SD; n = 3), respectively, corresponding with liposomes synthesized at canthaxanthin IC = 0.1%, IC = 0.5%, and IC = 1%. The polydispersity index (PDI) of all samples remained lower than 0.2. There were no significant differences in the mean size and PDI between blank lecithin liposome and canthaxanthin- and α-tocopherol-loaded liposomes. The encapsulation efficiency of canthaxanthin- and α-tocopherol-loaded liposomes decreased when increasing the concentration of canthaxanthin in lecithin liposomes, with EE% values of IC = 0.1%, IC = 0.5%, and IC = 1% being 85.3 ± 2.1, 72.9 ± 1.8, and 55.3 ± 2.6, respectively. For fish growth, at the end of the experiment, final weight was significantly higher in fish fed with diet supplemented with 1 g/kg canthaxanthin- and α-tocopherol-loaded liposomes (IC = 0.5%) in comparison to other experimental control groups. The difference in color of the salmon muscle was most apparent after two months of feeding. However, after three months, there was no noticeable change in the color score of the fish muscle, indicating saturation of color of the fish muscle. The above results suggest the potential of canthaxanthin- and a-tocopherol-loaded liposomes as the red pigment in fish aquaculture.

AB  - Chloramine-T has been commonly used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of bacterial gill disease and related phenomena in the salmonid aquaculture industry, and it is now commonly used as a prophylactic agent to prevent diseases in commercial salmonid hatcheries. Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (average weight 98 g) were exposed to chloramine-T at 10 mg/L for 1 h twice weekly (a commonly used regime in the aquaculture industry) for 11 weeks. Fish were fed ad libitum without feed wastage throughout the 11 -week trial. Body weight, specific growth rate, feed conversion index, and appetite were assessed at the end of weeks 3, 6, 9, and 11. Chloramine-T treatment was not associated with either clinical disease or mortality. However, by the end of the trial, growth (based on body weight) of treated fish was significantly suppressed (δ = 7.3%) compared with control fish. Growth suppression was attributed to a significant reduction (δ = 9.3%) of feed conversion efficiency in treated fish. Based ...

AB  - In this study, the effects of oxygen supplementation in different stocking densities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) on the specific growth rates (SGR), feed conversion ratios (FCR) and survival rates were investigated in a commercial-scale culture system. High density cultures were maintained in a total of nine (12 m 3 ) flow-through systems supplemented with O2. Initial stocking rates for 3 different treatments with three replicates were 26.88±0.30 (low density), 36.72±0.26 (medium density) and 55.03±0.14kg m -3 (high density), corresponding to a total of 5800, 8000 and 12000 fish/tank, respectively. Water flow rate for each tank was maintained at 11±1.1 L sec -1 (660 L min -1 ) over the study period for each raceway, and the temperature was 12.3±0.8°C throughout the experimental period. At the end of the study, there were no significant differences in the survival rates and SGR among treatments (p>0.05). However, FCR was negatively affected in the high density treatment (p<0.05). Overall, our results indicated that oxygen supplementation supported fish growth and survival in high stocking densities. However, high production cost is prohibitive and further studies are required to reduce costs.

AB  - The ability of mobile stages of Lepeophtheirus salmonis to transfer between salmon, Salmo salar L., hosts was examined by two methods. The first of these was the removal of certain stages on farmed fish, while the second comprised the placement of mobile lice on clean fish in the laboratory. In one-sea-winter farmed salmon, 63% of males and 52% of female lice transferred to new hosts over a period of 4 days. In laboratory trials on post-smolts, 61% of males and 69% of female lice transferred to new hosts over 3 days. In another experiment, free-swimming adult male lice were added to the tank, and 90% of these were found on fish after 24 h. Immigration of lice to fish in trial cages and the large proportion of lice transferring between fish in both laboratory and farm trials indicates that L. salmonis can transfer between hosts.

AB  - <jats:p>Sexual maturation of post-smolts is a concern for Atlantic salmon producers, and its occurrence is dependent upon factors such as water temperature and energy availability, among others. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of different temperatures and feeding regimes on testis development and local regulation of spermatogenesis in salmon post-smolts. A 3 × 2 factorial design was used, with three temperatures (8 °C, 12.5 °C, and 18 °C) and two feed regimes (100% and 67% ration). Salmon (1800 parr, initial mean weight 23.1 ± 7.2 g) were reared from 28 October 2018 to 30 May 2019 in a freshwater flow-through system under continuous light (LD24:0), except for a 5-week winter signal (LD12:12) introduced on 4 February 2019. Testis histology, transcription of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (fshr) and luteinizing hormone receptor (lhr), and transcription of testis proteins involved in spermatogenesis regulation such as gonadal-soma-derived factors 1 (gsdf1) and 2 (gsdf2), anti-Müllerian hormone (amh), and insulin-like growth factor-3 (igf3), were analyzed. Results showed that high temperature alone (18 °C), irrespective of the feed regime, promoted early presence of type B spermatogonia and reduced transcript levels of the proliferation-inhibitory factor amh in males still considered immature, of groups 18–100% and 18–67% that later matured in high proportion (~100%). This effect was also present to some degree in the group 12.5–100% (40% maturation), and absent in 12.5–67%, 8–100%, and 8–67% (groups with little or no maturation). Later, at onset of rapid testis growth, high temperature was linked to a pronounced downregulation of amh and of the self-renewal factors gsdf1 and gsdf2, as well as to a pronounced upregulation of the proliferation-stimulating factor igf3. Overall, the present findings demonstrate that rearing salmon at high temperatures can stimulate an early activation of the brain–pituitary–gonad axis before actual onset of rapid testis growth, enhancing and accelerating the mechanisms that control initiation and progression of maturation, while the feed regime has a minor impact. This poses a challenge for current salmon aquaculture practices that use sustained high temperature to maximize growth, since these practices increase the risk of early post-smolt maturation.</jats:p>

AB  - Lumpfish is now the single most important cleaner fish species to date and there is an extensive lumpfish translocation along the Norwegian coast. A reliable baseline information about the population genetic structure of lumpfish is a prerequisite for an optimal managing of the species to minimize possible genetic translocation and avoid possible hybridisation and introgression with local populations. The current study is a follow up of the study of Jónsdóttir et al. (2018) using expressed sequence tag-short tandem repeats (EST-STRs) markers. Samples (N = 291) were analysed from six sample locations along the Norwegian coastline from south to north, with additional 18 samples of first-generation (from wild fish) reared fish from a fish farm outside Tromsø (North Norway). Present findings show a lack of population differentiation among lumpfish sampling population along the Norwegian coast using EST-STRs, which is in accordance with the findings of Jónsdóttir et al. (2018) where genomic STRs (g-STRs) were analysed. Present findings indicate that should translocated lumpfish escape from salmon sea pens in Norway, this will probably have little impact on the genetic composition of the local lumpfish population.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that immune-related recombinant proteins can enhance immune function, increasing host survival against infectious diseases in salmonids. This research evaluated inclusion bodies (IBs) of antimicrobial peptides (CAMP<sup>IB</sup> and HAMP<sup>IB</sup>) and a cytokine (IL1β<sup>IB</sup> and TNFα<sup>IB</sup>) as potential immunostimulants in farmed salmonids. For this purpose, we produced five IBs (including iRFP<sup>IB</sup> as a control), and we evaluated their ability to modulate immune marker gene expression of three IBs in the RTS11 cell line by RT-qPCR. Additionally, we characterized the scale-up of IBs production by comparing two different scale systems. The results showed that CAMP<sup>IB</sup> can increase the upregulation of <i>tnfα</i>, <i>il1β</i>, <i>il8</i>, and <i>il10</i>, HAMP<sup>IB</sup> significantly increases the upregulation of <i>tnfα</i>, <i>inos</i>, and <i>il10</i>, and IL1β<sup>IB</sup> significantly upregulated the expression of <i>tnfα</i>, <i>il1β</i>, and <i>cox2</i>. A comparison of IL1β<sup>IB</sup> production showed that the yield was greater in shake flasks than in bioreactors (39 ± 1.15 mg/L and 14.5 ± 4.08 mg/L), and larger nanoparticles were produced in shake flasks (540 ± 129 nm and 427 ± 134 nm, <i>p</i> < 0.0001, respectively). However, compared with its shake flask counterpart, the IL1β<sup>IB</sup> produced in a bioreactor has an increased immunomodulatory ability. Further studies are needed to understand the immune response pathways activated by IBs and the optimal production conditions in bioreactors, such as a defined medium, fed-batch production, and mechanical bacterial lysis, to increase yield.

AB  - Relocating Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. farms away from important salmonid rivers is possibly a means to reduce Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer, 1837) interactions between farmed Atlantic salmon and wild salmonids. However, to date, no data have been presented on the conse- quences of salmon farm relocation in terms of densities of planktonic L. salmonis. Near-surface plankton were sampled at 5 stations during 2 full farming production cycles; 1 before and 1 after a salmon farm relocation within a sea loch/fjord. The relocation comprised the removal of a salmon farm and the reallocation of its fish biomass to a different farm within the same management area. Over 85% of the larval sea lice we identified in sub-samples were L. salmonis; we therefore assumed that the majority of the larvae found were of that species. Densities of L. salmonis larvae increased significantly at all stations post relocation, except at the station near the vacated farm site where mean densities of nauplii were significantly lower and mean densities of copepodids were lower without statistical significance. The removal/relocation of the salmon farm significantly reduced the production of L. salmonis larvae, but did not significantly reduce the infection pressure, as repre- sented by densities of the infectious copepodid stage, at the vacated farm site. This finding indicates that planktonic L. sal monis were transported to the vacated farm site from sources at a minimum of 5 to 8 km distant.

AB  - Summary Atlantic and Pacific salmon are ecologically important both for the marine food web and for terrestrial ecosystems, as they provide nutrient transport when the mature fishes migrate upstream. With their complex life cycle, they are also extremely sensitive to changes affecting their river runs. Demand for human consumption is partially covered by supplementation with hatchery fish or aquaculture, but these interventions can also come with their own sets of problems. Michael Gross reports.

AB  - Sea louse (Family Caligidae: genera Caligus and Lepeophtheirus) infection of farmed salmonids represents a significant threat to animal welfare and undermines profitability. Lice may also act as vectors for the transmission of viral and bacterial pathogens. Pest-control programmes parallel those deployed in terrestrial livestock farming and include the use of parasiticides. The authorisation process for fish medicines varies widely between salmon farming countries and undue regulatory constraint may place farmers in one country at a competitive disadvantage. In many jurisdictions, fish are a 'minor' species and mounting demands for environmental assessment increase registration costs. A successful integrated louse-management strategy requires free access to a range of effective, chemically unrelated active ingredients deployed according to current best practice. Over-reliance on a limited number of products will lead, inevitably, to resistance, which is difficult to counter.

AB  - With a whole genome duplication event and wealth of biological data, salmonids are excellent model organisms for studying evolutionary processes, fates of duplicated genes and genetic and physiological processes associated with complex behavioral phenotypes. It is surprising therefore, that no salmonid genome has been sequenced. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a good representative salmonid for sequencing given its importance in aquaculture and the genomic resources available. However, the size and complexity of the genome combined with the lack of a sequenced reference genome from a closely related fish makes assembly challenging. Given the cost and time limitations of Sanger sequencing as well as recent improvements to next generation sequencing technologies, we examined the feasibility of using the Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX pyrosequencing system to obtain the sequence of a salmonid genome. Eight pooled BACs belonging to a minimum tiling path covering ~1 Mb of the Atlantic salmon genome were sequenced by GS FLX shotgun and Long Paired End sequencing and compared with a ninth BAC sequenced by Sanger sequencing of a shotgun library. An initial assembly using only GS FLX shotgun sequences (average read length 248.5 bp) with ~30× coverage allowed gene identification, but was incomplete even when 126 Sanger-generated BAC-end sequences (~0.09× coverage) were incorporated. The addition of paired end sequencing reads (additional ~26× coverage) produced a final assembly comprising 175 contigs assembled into four scaffolds with 171 gaps. Sanger sequencing of the ninth BAC (~10.5× coverage) produced nine contigs and two scaffolds. The number of scaffolds produced by the GS FLX assembly was comparable to Sanger-generated sequencing; however, the number of gaps was much higher in the GS FLX assembly. These results represent the first use of GS FLX paired end reads for de novo sequence assembly. Our data demonstrated that this improved the GS FLX assemblies; however, with respect to de novo sequencing of complex genomes, the GS FLX technology is limited to gene mining and establishing a set of ordered sequence contigs. Currently, for a salmonid reference sequence, it appears that a substantial portion of sequencing should be done using Sanger technology.

AB  - Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB), are natural phenomena that are produced by the proliferation of phytoplankton potentially harmful to humans and for some ecosystem services ( e.g ., good water quality for use in aquaculture, availability of natural resources). In Chile, HAB events of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and Alexandrium catenella are particularly relevant due to their potential toxicity. Although there are studies of the negative impact of these events, both the prediction of the occurrence of these phenomena and the associated risks are limited in the country. The proliferations have been attributed to the action of various oceanographic forcings ( e.g ., vertical stratification, irradiation, availability of nutrients). A research has been made about the factors and processes that have been associated with the appearance, permanence and toxicity of HAB and about the methodological efforts made to study and generate HAB forecasts in other countries. Based on a compilation of the information of occurrences and localities affected by these events, the seasonal, interannual and spatial variability of the events or occurrences of HAB in Chile was constructed. Subsequently, the current monitoring system is described, as well as future prediction efforts. Finally, the configuration of a monitoring system with observations and integrated prediction for the occurrence of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and Alexandrium catenella is suggested.

AB  - Salmon is an oily fish which contains vitamin D which cannot be obtained from the sun during the winter months in Scotland. Yet, farmed salmon often has a higher carbon footprint relative to chicken which conflicts with the Scottish government’s aims of reducing carbon emissions while improving vitamin D intake. This paper investigates how the application of carbon consumption taxes on meat and fish products may affect these aims. Carbon and nutrient elasticities are calculated from Marshallian price elasticities of demand which are obtained from a linear version of an almost ideal demand system (LA-AIDS). The household purchasing data used in the analysis were obtained from Kantar Worldpanel for the years 2006-2011 with nutrient data provided by Defra and the Food Standards agency. The results suggest that taxing only meat products would have the positive effect of reducing carbon emissions associated with Scottish household food consumption by 46,304.02 t/CO2e/y. Also, the intake of vitamin D per person would increase by 0.08 μg/day which represents 3.81% of the government’s recommended daily vitamin D intake. Taxing both fish and meat products is likely to result in a reduction of vitamin D intake. Total fat intake is likely to reduce for either scenario.

AB  - Sturgeon aquaculture has taken a parallel yet unique path relative to other teleost rearing. One of the driving factors has been the fact that virtually all extant species are facing extinction; thus, laws concerning the transport and processing of sturgeon are stringent. As a result, most sturgeon companies vertically integrate the farming process from hatchery to harvest, in contrast to the production of other commercial fish species (e.g., trout, sea bass, salmon), where farmers tend to purchase fry from producers specialized only in the production of that life stage and sell product to unaffiliated fish processors. Sturgeon aquaculture is furthermore unique in the extremely high value of the main product (caviar). The secondary product (meat) also surpasses other finfish aquaculture products' average price per weight. These expensive outputs reveal the greatest challenge in production — an exceptionally long time to market from larvae to harvestable adults. For all their rigor and robustness as juveniles and adults, sturgeon species are highly fragile during larval stages. Due to the unique legal framework around sturgeon cultivation, aquaculturists often specialize in regional species, although some hybrids have achieved global popularity. This lends to a heterogenous swath of literature on best cultivation and management practices, especially at early growth stages. Nonetheless, the role of aquaculture as both a food source and restocking program to thwart further extinction of sturgeon species has hardly been fully tapped. In light of the many challenges, this review examines recent advances in sturgeon farming with an emphasis on broodstock and early life-stage management to summarize studies that can help researchers and farmers assess the industry's current state.

AB  - A total of 130 strains of the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida isolated in Denmark, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the USA were examined. The strains originated from farmed salmonid fish. The biochemical, physiological and serological characteristics, antibiotic resistance patterns and cell surface-related properties were compared. Aeromonas salmonicida was found to be remarkably consistent in general cultural and biochemical characteristics. It is noteworthy that the strains were positive in the fermentation of L-arabinose and were negative in the fermentation of D-arabinose. All the strains were highly proteolytic. It was observed, however, that 5% of the strains did not digest calf and trout serum and the production of haemolysin and degradation of casein by the same strains were delayed compared with the other strains. Common to all of the rough strains were auto-aggregation and ability to bind the dyes Coomassie brilliant blue and Congo red and the majority of these strains were highly hydrophobic. The strains were tested for their susceptibility to 22 antibacterial agents. Antibiotic resistance profiles of Aer. salmonicida indicated that resistance to the quinolones and oxytetracycline was increasing and that multi-resistant strains were found in several countries. The variation found in antibiograms could have potential as epidemiological markers in certain geographic areas.

AB  - Vaccination of fish against many different pathogenic organisms has made it possible to rear Atlantic salmon in net pen cages and produce fish commercially around the world. In fact, vaccine use is critical for the continued growth of the aquaculture industry and researchers are continually looking to develop new and improved vaccines for a wide variety of fish pathogens. Fish vaccines have been formulated from killed or attenuated pathogens, recombinant viral proteins or peptides, and most recently, plasmid DNA encoding viral proteins (1-7). The use of DNA vaccines for the control of viral diseases of fish is particularly appealing since this type of vaccine eliminates the need to purify the viral pathogen or immunoprotective antigen. Other advantages are the elimination of any possibility of reversion to virulence since the DNA vaccine encodes only a portion of the viral genome, the relative stability of the DNA preparation; the ease of DNA preparation; and, importantly, the elicitation of a robust immune response in fish.

AB  - Population-specific spatial and temporal distribution data are necessary to identify mechanisms regulating abundance and to manage anthropogenic impacts.However the distributions of highly migratory species are often difficult to resolve, particularly when multiple populations' movements overlap.Here we present an integrated model to estimate spatially-stratified, seasonal trends in abundance and population composition, using data from extensive genetic sampling of commercial and recreational Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) fisheries in southern British Columbia.We use the model to estimate seasonal changes in population-specific standardized catch per unit effort (a proxy for abundance) across six marine regions, while accounting for annual variability in sampling effort and uncertain genetic stock assignment.We also share this model as an R package stockseasonr for application to other regions and species.Even at the relatively small spatial scales considered here, we found that patterns in seasonal abundance differed among regions and stocks.While certain locations were clearly migratory corridors, regions within the Salish Sea exhibited diverse, and often weak, seasonal patterns in abundance, emphasizing that they are important, year-round foraging habitats.Furthermore, we found evidence that stocks with similar freshwater life histories and adult run timing, as well as relatively proximate spawning locations, exhibited divergent distributions.Our findings highlight subtle, but important differences in how adult Chinook salmon use marine habitats.Down-scaled model outputs could be used to inform ecosystem-based management efforts by resolving the degree to which salmon overlap with other species of concern, as well as specific fisheries.More broadly, variation in stock-specific abundance among regions indicates efforts to identify mechanisms driving changes in size-at-maturity and natural mortality should account for distinct marine distributions.

AB  - <jats:p>In this study, the effects of photo-electrocatalysis (PEC) were evaluated as an innovative application of conventional photocatalysis (PC) to remediate water in a recirculating system for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) culture, in relation to fish welfare and health, with a multidisciplinary approach. Three tanks were employed, equipped with conventional biological filters as a control system, and three tanks equipped with the PEC purification system. The concentrations of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate ions in water were monitored, and the fish’s oxidative damage and stress response were evaluated in parallel. The water of the PEC-treated experimental group showed lower ammonia (TAN) and nitrite concentrations and higher nitrate concentration, possibly deriving from TAN oxidation through PEC, also leading to gaseous N2. Histological analysis did not reveal any pathological alteration in the gills and liver of both groups. The superoxide dismutase (sod1), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx1), and Tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) gene expressions were significantly higher in the control group than in the PEC-treated group, while the Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) expression did not show any difference in the two groups. These results indicate that the use of PEC filters has a positive effect on water quality, compared to the use of conventional biological filters, inducing a high level of welfare in O. mykiss.</jats:p>

AB  - Phospholipid which is able to induce the differentiation of some undifferentiated tumour cells was isolated from the rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) embryos. As HPLC gave only one peak, the phospholipid seemed to be completely purified. However, the spectra of SIMS and FD-MS have shown that it was a mixture of two molecular species. By the chemical and enzymic studies their structures were determined as C16:0/C22:6-and C18:1/C22:6-phosphatidyl cholines. The isolated and structurally elucidated phosphatidyl cholines induce haemoglobin synthesis in murine erythroleukemia cells and a rapid decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity in teratocarcinoma cells. Some phosphatidyl cholines which are commercially available have shown no or conspicuously low activities. Recently we isolated another differentiation-inducing substance(s), which proved to be diglyceride(s) containing the completely same fatty acids as those in the above mentioned phosphatidyl cholines, that is, C16:0/C22:6-and C18:1/C22:6. These results suggest that the lipids containing C22:6 fatty acid or this fatty acid itself might play an important part in the differentiation and development.

AB  - The presence of genetically modified food products within our food system has been a topic of discussion around the world. One source of controversy is whether or not the benefits of genetically modified foods outweigh the potential environmental impact of their production. One important environmental impact of genetically modified (GM) foods is the threat to biodiversity resulting from the genetic transfer from GM crops to native plant species. Another concern is that the increased use of herbicides like Monsanto Roundup  will lead to a new generation of herbicide-resistant weeds that could hamper plant growth. Additionally, since GM crops can be resistant to pests as well, this can lead to pests developing resistance genes at a faster rate than normal. Pollution is another environmental issue, including the issue of increased underwater pollution resulting from GM salmon that can lead to the destruction of aquatic life. Many nations, such as the European Union, United States, and Australia, have policies in place that have allowed the entrance of various GM foods into our food system. However, researchers state that one of the problems involved in addressing the environmental issues surrounding GM foods is that there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes environmental damage or environmental harm. Regarding GM foods, consumers place their trust the most in university scientists and farmers, followed by government agencies and environmental groups with a moderate trust level, and they place the least amount of trust in food producers and supermarkets. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the policies in different countries and the impact of GM food production on the environment.

AB  - Underwater vehicles such as AUVs and ROVs with hovering capabilities is a promising method for inspection of net integrity in large scale, sea based, salmon farms. The location of the salmon farms cause underwater vehicles to be affected by strong tidal currents and waves. In this thesis a six degree of freedom unified process plant model combining seakeeping theory and maneuvering theory for a small work ROV called Argus Mariner is developed. Using the software WAMIT, the hydrodynamic potential coefficients and wave induced forces and moments are found. A basic control system for traversing a dynamic netcage model is developed. The models and control system are implemented in a simulation environment called FhSim developed by SINTEF Fishery and Aquaculture AS.

AB  - <i>Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i> is the causative agent of bacterial cold-water disease in salmonids and rainbow trout fry syndrome. This pathogen has attained a global presence and can spread both horizontally and vertically. However, it was not documented in Korea before September 2018. In this study, the objectives were to characterize <i>Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i> strain FPRT1, isolated from diseased rainbow trout genotypically and phenotypically. We also conducted various investigations to better understand its impact and assess potential control measures. We acquired fifty rainbow trout (approximately 70 g in weight) and transferred them to a laboratory aquarium. During the initial acclimation period, we observed mortality and examined affected fish for clinical signs. We isolated the bacterium from the spleen of infected rainbow trout using tryptone yeast extract salts agar supplemented with glucose, naming this FPRT1. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out, and from the result, we selected enrofloxacin to administer to the trout orally to reduce mortality. To evaluate pathogenicity, we exposed the trout to FPRT1 at different water temperatures (8, 15, and 22 °C). Genomic analysis was conducted to identify the serotype and relatedness of FPRT1 to European strains. Affected fish displayed clinical signs, such as ulcerative lesions in the mandible, anemia with pale gills, exophthalmia, and increased mucus secretion. Internal symptoms included pale liver and enlarged spleen. FPRT1 was susceptible to erythromycin, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, and gentamicin, but resistant to oxolinic acid and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Oral administration of enrofloxacin resulted in a decrease in mortality from 28% to 6%. Pathogenicity tests revealed varying mortality rates due to FPRT1 at different temperatures. The highest rates were observed at 8 °C (ranging from 43% to 100%) for both intraperitoneal and intramuscular injections, and lower rates occurred at 22 °C (ranging from 0% to 30%), with intramuscular injections displaying higher susceptibility. Genomic analysis identified FPRT1 as serotype 2 and indicated its close genetic relationship with European strains based on the core genome and dispensable genome. The substantial genomic similarity between our strain and European strains suggests the possibility of bacterial spread through the importation of fertilized eggs from Europe. In conclusion, this study highlights the introduction of the previously undocumented pathogen (<i>F. psychrophilum</i>) into Korean rainbow trout populations. The detection of this pathogen and its pathogenicity assessment is not only important for understanding its impact on local aquaculture but also for establishing surveillance and control measures to prevent further transmission and outbreaks in the region.

AB  - Boxwood (Buxus sp. L.) is a very popular evergreen shrub in the United States which is widely used as landscape plant and fresh greenery. Boxwood 'Green velvet' (B. sinica var. insularis x B. sempervirens) plants grown in field condition exhibiting Volutella blight symptoms were found in a commercial nursery in Warren Co., Tennessee in May 2019. Leaves appeared red, brown or tan color on affected plants. Waxy, salmon pink colored fruiting bodies (sporodochia) were observed underneath the affected leaves using a hand lens (Figure 1). Leaf drop was also observed on plants. Black lesions under the bark were observed in some of the plants. The disease severity (percentage leaf area diseased) was nearly 40% and the disease incidence was nearly 30% of 1,000 plants. Infected leaf and stem tissues collected from four symptomatic plants were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol and washed with sterile distilled water. Culturing the infected leaf and stem pieces, 5-mm in size, on potato dextrose agar (PDA) consistently yielded white fluffy aerial mycelium growth with scattered salmon-color slimy masses of conidia forming from sporodochia after 10 days incubation at 25°C in a 12-h fluorescent light and dark cycle. A total of two isolates (FBG2020_396 and FBG2020_405) were hyphal tip purified on PDA. The conidia (n = 50) were hyaline, aseptate, fusiform to ellipsoidal measuring average of 7.8 × 3.3 μm (range: 4.84 to 13.2 μm × 2.2 to 4.64 μm). To confirm the pathogen identity, total DNA was extracted using UltraClean Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) directly from a 5-day old culture of isolates (FBG2020_396 and FBG2020_405) on PDA. The ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), β-tubulin (tub2) and part of 28S large ribosomal subunit (LSU) regions were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs ITS 5/ITS 4, T1/BTb2 and LR0R/LR5, respectively (Glass and Donaldson 1995; O'Donnell and Cigelnik 1997; Rehner and Samuels 1994; Vilgalys and Hester 1990; White et al. 1990). Newly generated sequences - GenBank/NCBI acc. nos. MW459251, MW465902 (ITS), MW464656, MW464657 (tub2) and MW459255, MW465903 (LSU) were 100% identical to Pseudonectria foliicola L. Lombard & Crous ex-type (CBS 123190) sequences KM231776, KM232035 and NG_058095, respectively. To complete Koch's postulates, six boxwood 'Green velvet' plants grown in 10 cm square pots (containing 40% coarse sand and 60% ground pine bark) were inoculated by spraying conidial suspension of P. foliicola [FBG2020_396 (1 × 105 conidia/mL)] obtained from 2-wk-old PDA cultures. Plants were covered with clear plastic humidity domes for 3 days and then they were maintained in a growth chamber at 25°C and 60% RH in a 12-h fluorescent light and dark cycle. Six control boxwood plants were maintained in the same environment without pathogen introduction. Pathogenicity test was conducted twice. After 10 days, typical symptoms of Volutella blight developed on the inoculated plants and microscopic examination revealed the same pathogen morphology as the original isolate. Pseudonectria foliicola was consistently re-isolated from leaves and stems. All control boxwood plants remained symptom-free and P. foliicola was not isolated from the leaves or stems. Pseudonectria foliicola causing Volutella blight has been reported on B. sempervirens in Czech Republic (Spetik et al. 2020), New Zealand (Lombard et al. 2015); Buxus sp. in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Washington (Salgado-Salazar et al. 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Volutella blight of boxwood caused by P. foliicola in Tennessee. Pseudonectria foliicola is an opportunistic pathogen and infects weak, stressed, and injured boxwood plants/cuttings (Rivera et al. 2018). This pathogen could cause a serious economic loss to boxwood nursery growers, as it can significantly affect the ornamental value of boxwood plants and fresh greenery. Integration of sanitation practices with other disease management strategies such as biorational products and reduced-ri k fungicides will be necessary for limiting the spread of pathogen and successful management of P. foliicola on boxwood in both field and postharvest conditions.

Adverse reactions have been reported to bath treatments including mortalities, inappetance, reduction in growth and reduced louse sensitivity to dichlorvos. The physical constraints of bath treatments are examined and improvements recommended. Oxygen saturation was adequate during treatments but declined rapidly when the tarpaulin was removed. A chemical marker dispersed uniformally both horizontally and vertically in a cage within 5 mins of dispensing indicating dispersal of a medicine is rapid and adequate during treatment. The range in enclosed volumes in 86 treatments was 46 to 146% of theoretical, suggesting potential toxicity due to high concentrations at low volumes and the risk of reduced sensitivity at high volumes. Residual concentrations of hydrogen peroxide varied from 50 to 400 ppm from 5 to 15 mins after the tarpaulin was removed. Water exchange should be encouraged by aerating the cage and flushing at the end of treatment.

AB  - Article Figures and data Abstract eLife digest Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods Data availability References Decision letter Author response Article and author information Metrics Abstract In many species, males can make rapid adjustments to ejaculate performance in response to sperm competition risk; however, the mechanisms behind these changes are not understood. Here, we manipulate male social status in an externally fertilising fish, chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and find that in less than 48 hr, males can upregulate sperm velocity when faced with an increased risk of sperm competition. Using a series of in vitro sperm manipulation and competition experiments, we show that rapid changes in sperm velocity are mediated by seminal fluid and the effect of seminal fluid on sperm velocity directly impacts paternity share and therefore reproductive success. These combined findings, completely consistent with sperm competition theory, provide unequivocal evidence that sperm competition risk drives plastic adjustment of ejaculate quality, that seminal fluid harbours the mechanism for the rapid adjustment of sperm velocity and that fitness benefits accrue to males from such adjustment. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28811.001 eLife digest Males of many animal species fight to establish social dominance and control access to females so that they have more opportunities to reproduce than their competitors. Males with lower social status will struggle to directly compete for mates, thus they attempt to mate with females by stealth. This often leads to more than one male mating with the same female so that the sperm from each male end up competing to fertilise that female’s eggs, a phenomenon known as sperm competition. Males suspend their sperm in a fluid to make a mixture known as semen. It has been shown that, compared to high status males, low status males will produce higher quality semen that contains greater numbers of faster swimming sperm, giving them an advantage in sperm competition. Growing evidence from several species indicates that males can quickly adjust how fast their sperm swim in response to social cues that signal changing risks of sperm competition. However, how these rapid adjustments occur remains largely unknown, and whether they alter a male’s reproductive success against a competitor has seldom been examined. Chinook salmon usually live in the North Pacific Ocean but they swim up rivers in North America and Asia to reproduce. They have also been introduced to several other countries including New Zealand where they are farmed commercially. The fish are highly prized by sport fishermen and are also of cultural significance to certain groups of indigenous people in North America. Barlett et al. studied the semen of chinook salmon, undertaking a series of experiments in which males switched between high and low social status. The experiments show that, as predicted, the sperm of males that changed from high to low social status started to swim faster. These changes in speed were caused by the fluid in the semen and altered the number of eggs that the male’s sperm fertilised when competing against sperm from another male. In their natural range some populations of chinook salmon are declining due to overfishing combined with habitat loss and alteration. The findings of Barlett et al. contribute to a better understanding of how this fish species reproduces, which may lead to the introduction of measures that help natural populations to recover or help to improve commercial farming. Improved knowledge of how the fluid in semen affects sperm activity may also have important consequences for our wider understanding of male fertility in humans and other animals. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28811.002 Introduction Sperm competition (Parker, 1970) occurs commonly across many invertebrate and vertebrate taxa and is a potent evolutionary force influencing male reproductive biology (Birkhead and Møller, 1998; Birkhead and Pizzari, 2002; Simmons and Fitzpatrick, 2012). Spe m competition theory predicts that males will trade-off between energy expended making high-quality ejaculates with obtaining mating opportunities and that males will invest differentially in ejaculates with respect to sperm competition risk (Parker, 1990; Parker et al., 1997; Parker, 1998; Wedell et al., 2002; Birkhead et al., 2009; Parker and Pizzari, 2010). In agreement with these predictions, males of many species can make rapid adjustments to ejaculate quality within days (Rudolfsen et al., 2006; Pizzari et al., 2007; Thomas and Simmons, 2007; Gasparini et al., 2009; Smith and Ryan, 2011), hours (Cornwallis and Birkhead, 2007a) and even minutes (Kilgallon and Simmons, 2005; Joseph et al., 2015) of exposure to a new social cue that signals changing sperm competition risk, such as the presence of a female, or a male competitor. For example, in fowl (Gallus gallus), males of dominant social status strategically allocate sperm, ejaculating more and faster swimming sperm in initial copulations and to females of higher quality (Pizzari et al., 2003; Cornwallis and Birkhead, 2006; Cornwallis and Birkhead, 2007a; Cornwallis and Birkhead, 2007b), and alter their allocation strategy accordingly when changing social status (Cornwallis and Birkhead, 2007a). While males of several vertebrate species ranging from fish (Rudolfsen et al., 2006; Gasparini et al., 2009; Smith and Ryan, 2011) to humans (Kilgallon and Simmons, 2005; Joseph et al., 2015) can strategically alter the quality of their ejaculate in response to social cues, the mechanism behind such rapid adjustments is as yet unknown. A promising candidate mechanism for rapid adjustment of sperm velocity may be found in the non-sperm component (seminal fluid and its constituents) of the ejaculate, particularly if such adjustments occur more rapidly than spermatogenesis (Cameron et al., 2007; Perry et al., 2013; Fitzpatrick and Lüpold, 2014). Seminal fluid is a complex medium containing a great diversity of molecules (Poiani, 2006; Juyena and Stelletta, 2012) and is known to influence sperm velocity and motility in vertebrates (Lahnsteiner et al., 1998; Lahnsteiner et al., 1996; Poiani, 2006; Locatello et al., 2013; González-Cadavid et al., 2014). For example, research using an externally fertilising fish, the grass goby (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus), compared males for which sperm competition strategy is determined by age/size and found large males that adopt a guarding strategy have a greater concentration of the seminal fluid glycoprotein mucin (Scaggiante et al., 1999). Furthermore, by separating and recombining seminal fluid and sperm from different males, research using the same species found seminal fluid had a tactic-specific effect on sperm velocity, with seminal fluid from sneak males decreasing the velocity of rival guard male sperm and seminal fluid from guard males increasing the velocity of sneak male sperm (Locatello et al., 2013). However, only one study to date has investigated the role that seminal fluid plays as a mediator of short-term plastic sperm performance in a vertebrate species using fowl and the results were inconsistent with theoretical expectation: Cornwallis and O'Connor, 2009 found that while ejaculates produced by male fowl that were allocated to females of higher quality contained faster sperm, seminal fluid from those ejaculates reduced the velocity of sperm from the same male allocated to females of lower quality. To be consistent with the prediction that seminal fluid mediates changes in sperm velocity, seminal fluid from ejaculates allocated to higher quality females should increase, not decrease the speed of sperm isolated from ejaculates allocated to lower quality females. Thus, although there is evidence that seminal fluid can influence sperm velocity, evidence that seminal fluid mediates the rapid plastic adjustment of an ejaculate’s motile performance consistent with theoretical expectation is lacking. We use an ideal model species, chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), to examine patterns of ejaculate plasticity in respons to changes in male social status and the reproductive consequences of these changes. In salmonids, fertilisation occurs externally and sperm competition occurs in the majority of spawnings (Berejikian et al., 2010; Sørum et al., 2011). Male chinook salmon adopt Alternative Reproductive Tactics (ARTs) situationally, as ‘hooknose’ males fight to establish social dominance (Esteve, 2005). Only dominant males guard spawning females thus obtaining priority in mating position, while subdominant males that lose contests attempt to sneak fertilisations by invading spawning pairs and releasing their sperm (Esteve, 2005). The social status of male salmon is subject to change over the course of a spawning season; for example, in coho salmon (O. kisutch), 22% of observed contests between hooknose males resulted in displacement of the previous dominant male (Healey and Prince, 1998). Therefore, in this mating system, females mate with multiple males in a dynamic social environment that results in intense levels of fluctuating sperm competition risk. Previous research has shown that when males engage in sperm competition, sperm swimming speed is the primary predictor of fertilisation success in chinook salmon (Evans et al., 2013; Rosengrave et al., 2016) and other salmonids (Gage et al., 2004; Liljedal et al., 2008; Egeland et al., 2015). Sperm competition theory therefore predicts subdominant males, which have greater sperm competition risk, will invest in ejaculates with faster swimming sperm than dominant males and males changing social status should adjust their investment accordingly (Parker, 1990; Parker et al., 1997; Parker, 1998; Wedell et al., 2002; Birkhead et al., 2009; Parker and Pizzari, 2010). Indeed, several studies that experimentally manipulated social status using Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) have found that subdominant males produce ejaculates with more sperm and faster swimming sperm than dominant males (Liljedal and Folstad, 2003; Rudolfsen et al., 2006; Vaz Serrano et al., 2006; Haugland et al., 2009). Furthermore, Rudolfsen et al. (2006) demonstrated that following a social challenge, both sperm concentration and velocity decreased over a 4-day period compared with pre-trial levels in dominant males, and observed an increase in sperm concentration but no change in sperm velocity for subdominant males. However, Rudolfsen et al. (2006) did not evaluate male social status prior to the social challenge, so it is unknown if these males actually changed or simply retained the same status through the course of the experiment. Recent research shows that ejaculates from subdominant Arctic charr sire the same number of eggs when in competition with ejaculates from dominant males if their sperm were released after the average delay observed under natural conditions (Egeland et al., 2015). These results suggest that salmonid males in disfavoured mating positions can compensate by producing more competitive ejaculates than dominant males, but whether males changing social status adjust their sperm velocity, and if such adjustments to ejaculates are mediated by sperm or non-sperm components of the ejaculate, is yet to be determined. Here, we use a comprehensive experimental approach to determine if changes in sperm velocity observed in response to an individual’s social position are the result of alterations to the gametes or to seminal fluid and if such responses actually alter a male’s reproductive success against a sperm competitor. Specifically, we examine whether ejaculate quality is phenotypically plastic in response to changes in sperm competition risk over 48 hr periods, using a two-stage challenge to manipulate social status (Cornwallis and Birkhead, 2007a; Pizzari et al., 2007) and collected ejaculates at each stage of the experiment. In the second stage, males either retained or were forced to change their social status, creating four social phenotypes with varying sperm competition risk (Figure 1). We found that subdominant males, which have greater sperm competition risk, invest more in both sperm o centration and sperm velocity compared to socially dominant males. Additionally, we find males that change from dominant to subdominant social status, thus elevated their sperm competition risk, increased their sperm velocity as predicted by sperm competition theory (Parker, 1990; Parker et al., 1997; Parker, 1998; Wedell et al., 2002; Birkhead et al., 2009; Parker and Pizzari, 2010). We also separated sperm from seminal fluid and created reciprocal combinations both within and between rival males, finding that males can make rapid adjustments to sperm velocity by producing seminal fluid that enhances sperm function. We then used in vitro fertilisation trials and found the seminal fluid effects on sperm swimming speed influences male reproductive success under sperm competition. Our combined experimental results provide compelling evidence that seminal fluid is the mediator of rapid strategic adjustment of sperm velocity, thus bringing us a critical step closer to identifying the underlying molecular mechanism that enables plasticity of ejaculate performance in dynamic social environments. Figure 1 Download asset Open asset Experimental design using a two-stage social status manipulation in chinook salmon. For each trial, in stage 1, four males of unknown social status were used to form two pairs and the social hierarchy within each pairing was then determined, assigning one male as dominant (D) and the other subdominant (S). After 48 hr, ejaculates were collected from each male (D, S, D, S). In stage 2, we reformed pairs, putting males with the same social status together, and re-determined the social hierarchy within each pairing. Males either retained the same status, dominant (DD) or subdominant (SS) in both stages, or changed status in either direction, dominant to subdominant (DS) or subdominant to dominant (SD). After 48 hr, ejaculates were recollected from each male (DD, DS, SD, SS). https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28811.003 Results Social status and ejaculate quality Subdominant (S) males had on average faster swimming sperm (Average Path Velocity, or VAP) than dominant (D) males. This difference was not significant when social status was initially determined in stage 1 (Table 1; Figure 2a) but was significant for stage 2 (Table 1; Figure 2b). Overall, there was considerable variation in sperm swimming speeds among males, accounted for by the random predictor ‘male identity’ that was significant in both stages (stage 1: χ2(1)=105.11, p<0.001; stage 2: χ2(1)=70.02, p<0.001). Additionally, sperm concentration was significantly higher in S than in D males in stage 1 (Table 1; Figure 3a), but not stage 2 (Table 1; Figure 3b). However, sperm concentration for males that remained subdominant (SS) was significantly higher than for those males that remained socially dominant (DD) in stage 2 (Table 1).

Seminal fluid from subdominant males increased the sperm swimming speed of sperm from dominant males, conversely, the seminal fluid from dominant males decreased sperm swimming speed of the sperm from subdominant males (Figure 5). However, rival’s social status was no longer significant (Table 3) when the difference in VAP between the focal male control and rival male control was added as a fixed predictor to the model, for which a significant positive linear relationship was detected (Table 3), with sperm in the seminal fluid of a rival that had faster VAP increasing sperm velocity and sperm in the seminal fluid of a rival that had slower VAP decreasing sperm velocity relative to VAP in their own seminal fluid (Figure 6).

Seminal fluid from dominant rival males on average decreased VAP of sperm from subdominant males. In contrast, seminal fluid from rival subdominant males on average increased VAP of sperm from dominant males.

AB  - Chile is the second-largest producer of Atlantic salmon in the world, and the Chilean salmon production accounts for 27% of the world’s production. One important step of the productive cycle in freshwater is the smoltification process that prepares the fish for the marine life stage. This review describes the biological basis of smoltification in Atlantic salmon, with particular attention on branchial osmoregulatory adaptations. We also discuss some of the infectious diseases and problems in smoltification (two of the main causes of losses in Chilean aquaculture) that could be related from a physiological point of view.

AB  - The interaction of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) levels with omega-6 to omega-3 ratios (ω6:ω3), and their impact on head kidney lipid metabolism in farmed fish, are not fully elucidated. We investigated the influence of five plant-based diets (12-week exposure) with varying EPA+DHA levels (0.3, 1.0, or 1.4%) and ω6:ω3 (high ω6, high ω3, or balanced) on tissue lipid composition, and transcript expression of genes involved in fatty acid and eicosanoid metabolism in Atlantic salmon head kidney. Tissue fatty acid composition was reflective of the diet with respect to C18 PUFA and MUFA levels (% of total FA), and ω6:ω3 (0.5-1.5). Fish fed 0.3% EPA+DHA with high ω6 (0.3% EPA+DHA↑ω6) had the highest increase in proportions (1.7-2.3-fold) and in concentrations (1.4-1.8-fold) of arachidonic acid (ARA). EPA showed the greatest decrease in proportion and in concentration (by ~½) in the 0.3% EPA+DHA↑ω6 fed fish compared to the other treatments. However, no differences were observed in EPA proportions among salmon fed the high ω3 (0.3 and 1.0% EPA+DHA) and balanced (1.4% EPA+DHA) diets, and DHA proportions were similar among all treatments. Further, the transcript expression of elovl5a was lowest in the 0.3% EPA+DHA↑ω6 fed fish, and correlated positively with 20:3ω3, 20:4ω3 and EPA:ARA in the head kidney. This indicates that high dietary 18:3ω3 promoted the synthesis of ω3 LC-PUFA. Dietary EPA+DHA levels had a positive impact on elovl5a, fadsd5 and srebp1 expression, and these transcripts positively correlated with tissue ΣMUFA. This supported the hypothesis that LC-PUFA synthesis is positively influenced by tissue MUFA levels in Atlantic salmon. The expression of pparaa was higher in the 0.3% EPA+DHA↑ω6 compared to the 0.3% EPA+DHA↑ω3 fed fish. Finally, significant correlations between head kidney fatty acid composition and the expression of eicosanoid synthesis-related transcripts (i.e., 5loxa, 5loxb, cox1, cox2, ptges2, ptges3, and pgds) illustrated the constitutive relationships among fatty acids and eicosanoid metabolism in salmon.

AB  - In 1990, the US International Trade Commission stated that Atlantic and Pacific salmon species did not share a substitute relationship in any of the product forms. This result is contrary to economic demand studies that show a substitute relationship for Atlantic and Pacific salmon species. Time‐series results reported in this paper are consistent with the earlier demand studies and show evidence of an equilibrium price system that includes Atlantic, chinook and coho salmon species for the US market. For these three salmon species a substitute relationship cannot be rejected. However, we observe only weak price links across the three different species in the different US regional markets.

AB  - Global population growth and changing diets increase the importance, and challenges, of reducing the environmental impacts of food production. Farmed seafood is a relatively efficient way to produce protein and has already overtaken wild fisheries. The use of protein-rich food crops, such as soy, instead of fishmeal in aquaculture feed diverts these important protein sources away from direct human consumption and creates new environmental challenges. Single cell proteins (SCPs), including bacteria and yeast, have recently emerged as replacements for plant-based proteins in salmon feeds. Attributional life cycle assessment is used to compare salmon feeds based on protein from soy, methanotrophic bacteria, and yeast ingredients. All ingredients are modeled at the industrial production scale and compared based on seven resource use and emissions indicators. Yeast protein concentrate showed drastically lower impacts in all categories compared to soy protein concentrate. Bacteria meal also had lower impacts than soy protein concentrate for five of the seven indicators. When these target meals were incorporated into complete feeds the relative trends remain fairly constant, but benefits of the novel ingredients are dampened by high impacts from the nontarget ingredients. Particularly, primary production requirements (PPR) are about equal and constant across all feeds for both analyses since PPR was driven by fishmeal and oil. The bacteria-based feed has the highest climate change impacts due to the use of methane to feed the bacteria who then release carbon dioxide. Overall, the results of this study suggest that incorporating SCP ingredients into salmon feeds can help reduce the environmental impacts of salmon production. Continued improvements in SCP production would further increase the sustainability of salmon farming.

AB  - A commercially available soybean molasses (alcohol extract from soybean meal) was included at levels of 0. 5,10,15 and 20% in a fish meal based diet for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., weighing about 75 g. These inclusion levels supplied dietary alcohol soluble components corresponding to levels that would have been obtained if a standard soybean meal was included at levels up to about 70%. The fish were reared in fresh water at 9oC and with a minimum of 7 ppm O2 at outlet, and fed the experimental diets for 14 days before the faeces were stripped. Digestibility coefficients were determined using chromic oxide as an indigestible indicator. The digestibility of fat, and particularly the long-chained, saturated-and monounsaturated fatty acids, were significantly reduced by increasing the inclusion level of soybean molasses, whereas digestibility of dry matter, protein (%N x 6.25) and polyunsaturated fatty acids were not affected significantly. The present results show that alcohol-soluble components of soybeans may be responsible for a significant part of the negative effects of standard soybean meal in diets for Atlantic salmon.

AB  - <jats:p>Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) have been classified depending on the causative organism and its impacts: non-toxic HAB (microalgae capable of affecting tourism and causing oxygen deficiency, which generates mortality of marine organisms), toxic HAB (microalgae capable of transferring toxins to the food chain), and ichthyotoxic HAB (microalgae capable of generating mechanical damage in fish). HABs represent a worldwide problem and have apparently increased in frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution at different latitudes. This review details the occurrence of HAB events in the Southeast Pacific, Chile, over a 65-year period, analysing two of the three types of HAB described: toxic and ichthyotoxic HABs. For this, we conducted a review from many different scientific sources and from the written press and social media, that have mentioned HAB events in the country. In Chile, the microalgae involved in HAB events are dinoflagellate (52%), diatoms (33%) and silicoflagellate (10%), with a total of 41 species and/or genera described in the literature. A total of 501 HAB events were recorded in Chile between 1956 and 2021, where 240 (47.9%), 238 (47.5%), 14 (2.7%), 8 (1.5%) and 1 (0.2%) event were caused by diatoms, dinoflagellate, silicoflagellate, raphidophycean and haptophyte, respectively. An apparent increase in the frequency of HAB events is observed since the first record in 1956, with a maximum of 46 events during the years 2017 and 2019. The highest incidence in fish is caused by the group of silicoflagellate, raphidophycean and haptophyte (23 events), where 10 events caused mortalities in salmon with an incidence rate of 43.4%. Unlike what is observed with diatoms and dinoflagellate, the events associated with these groups are less frequent, but hold a much higher salmon mortality rate. During the last 65 years, HAB’s geographic extent shows an apparent trend to increase south-to-north. However, the identification of events is closely linked to the areas where much of the country’s aquaculture is located and, therefore, it could be biased. In turn, it is observed that the apparent increase in HAB events could be associated with a greater monitoring effort after major events (e.g., after the 2016 HAB event). On the other hand, it is also recognized a lack of knowledge about harmful algae throughout the Chilean Humboldt Current system, particularly in the northern regions, such as Atacama and Coquimbo. Therefore, the total number of blooms that have occurred in fjords and channels, particularly those that have caused minor economic impacts for artisanal fishermen and the salmon and mussel farming sector, might be underestimated.</jats:p>

AB  - Aquaculture is an extremely valuable and rapidly expanding sector worldwide, but concerns exist related to environmental sustainability. The sediment below aquaculture farms receives inputs of antimicrobials, metal-containing products, and organic matter from uneaten food and fecal material. These inputs impact the surrounding marine microbial communities in complex ways; however, functional diversity shifts related to taxonomic composition remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of pollution from marine fish farms on sediment bacterial communities. We compared the bacterial communities and functional bacterial diversity in surface sediments at salmon aquaculture and reference sites in Chiloe, southern Chile, using Roche 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the predictive metagenomics approach (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States, PICRUSt). Bacterial diversity, measured as the inverse Simpson index, was significantly lower at aquaculture than at reference sites, while species richness, based on Chao’s estimator, was not significantly different. Nevertheless, community composition differed significantly between reference and aquaculture sites. We found that Gammaproteobacteria and several taxa involved in remediating metal contamination and known to have antimicrobial resistances were enriched at aquaculture sites. However, PICRUSt predicted functions indicated a degree of functional redundancy between sites, whereas taxonomic-functional relationships indicated differences in the functional traits of specific taxa at aquaculture sites. This study provides a first step in understanding the bacterial community structure and functional changes due to Chilean salmon aquaculture and has direct implications for using bacterial shifts as indicators of aquaculture perturbations.

AB  - An epidemiological study was carried out in Norway in 2015-2018, investigating the development of infection with Piscine myocarditis virus (PMCV) and development of cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) in farmed Atlantic salmon. Cohorts from 12 sites were followed and sampled every month or every other month from sea transfer to slaughter. PMCV was detected at all sites and in all sampled cages, and fish in six sites developed clinical CMS. The initial infection happened between 1 and 7 months post-sea transfer, and the median time from infection with PMCV until outbreak of CMS was 6.5 months. Generally, fish from sites with CMS had higher viral titre and a higher prevalence of PMCV, compared to sites that did not develop clinical CMS. The virus persisted until the point of slaughter at most (11 out of 12) of the sites. The detection of PMCV in all sites suggests that PMCV is more widespread than previously known. Screening for PMCV as a tool to monitor impending outbreaks of CMS must be supported by observations of the health status of the fish and risk factors for development of disease.

There should be no question that flows into, through, and out of California's Delta are biologically important. Equally true is that water is a limited resource. Competing demands for Delta water include flows for native fish, water supply for farms and cit- ies, and cold water held back in large reservoirs to cool salmon streams. With the Delta Reform Act of 2009, the California Legislature established as overarch- ing state policy the co-equal goals of a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. Since water is limited, there are inevitable trade-offs. This is where science and policy intersect. For too long, this tension has been handled one species at a time, one crisis at a time, and usually in court. This has fostered “combat science,” where regulatory agencies, water contractors, and environmental advocates line up their own hypotheses, ­studies, and conclusions like artillery in the courtroom. It has fed distrust and stymied col- laboration. This is a failed approach. A growing number of species dependent on the Delta are listed pursuant to the federal or state endangered species acts. Absent a change in how we manage the Delta, there is no evidence to suggest the situation will improve. We can do better. We must do better. The Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) (http://baydeltaconservationplan.com/ PlanningProcess/BDCP/BDCPProcess.aspx) takes a more comprehensive approach than the single-species management that has developed pursuant to Section 7 of the U.S. Endangered Species Act. In addition to providing a higher standard of protec- tion for listed species, the plan proposes to develop a more robust and collaborative science program that engages the same parties who historically have met in court to resolve disputes. Of course, this plan is not yet final. More environmental review and public input is scheduled, and ultimately our two departments have different roles: the California Department of Water Resources will propose a plan and the California

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> The flesh pigmentation of farmed Atlantic salmon is formed by accumulation of carotenoids derived from commercial diets. In the salmon gastrointestinal system, the hindgut is considered critical in the processes of carotenoids uptake and metabolism. In Tasmania, flesh color depletion can noticeably affect farmed Atlantic salmon at different levels of severity following extremely hot summers. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to investigate the reduction in flesh pigmentation. Library preparation is a key step that significantly impacts the effectiveness of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments. Besides the commonly used whole transcript RNA-Seq method, the 3’ mRNA-Seq method is being applied widely, owing to its reduced cost, enabling more repeats to be sequenced at the expense of lower resolution. Therefore, the output of the Illumina TruSeq kit (whole transcript RNA-Seq) and the Lexogen QuantSeq kit (3’ mRNA-Seq) was analyzed to identify genes in the Atlantic salmon hindgut that are differentially expressed (DEGs) between two flesh color phenotypes.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In both methods, DEGs between the two color phenotypes were associated with metal ion transport, oxidation-reduction processes, and immune responses. We also found DEGs related to lipid metabolism in the QuantSeq method. In the TruSeq method, a missense mutation was detected in DEGs in different flesh color traits. The number of DEGs found in the TruSeq libraries was much higher than the QuantSeq; however, the trend of DEGs in both library methods was similar and validated by qPCR.<jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>Flesh coloration in Atlantic salmon is related to lipid metabolism in which apolipoproteins, serum albumin and fatty acid-binding protein genes are hypothesized to be linked to the absorption, transport and deposition of carotenoids. Our findings suggest that Grp could inhibit the feeding behavior of low color-banded fish, resulting in the dietary carotenoid shortage. Several SNPs in genes involving in carotenoid-binding cholesterol and oxidative stress were detected in both flesh color phenotypes. Regarding the choice of the library preparation method, the selection criteria depend on the research design and purpose.<jats:bold> </jats:bold>The 3’ mRNA-Seq method is ideal for targeted identification of highly expressed genes, while the whole RNA-Seq method is recommended for identification of unknown genes, enabling the identification of splice variants and trait-associated SNPs, as we have found for Duox2 and DuoxA1.</jats:p>

AB  - The exponential growth of the salmonid farming industry during the last 3 decades has created conditions for massive escapes of these exotic species into natural environments in southern Chile. Here, we review and update information about salmonid escapes from 1993 to 2012 and examine their potential environmental, social, and economic consequences. We estimate that more than 1 million salmonids escape each year from marine farms, mainly due to weather conditions and technical and operational failures of net-pens. While a decrease in the magnitude of escaped Atlantic and coho salmon has occurred during the last several years, escaped rainbow trout have not followed the same pattern. Rainbow trout have become a greater threat to native ecosystems due to their greater potential to establish self-sustaining naturalized populations. The main ecological effects of escapees are related to short-term predatory effects upon native fish, long-term effects linked to the likelihood of farmed salmon establishing self-sustainable popula- tions, and disease and pathogen transfer to native fauna. More research is needed to identify and develop reliable indicators to estimate the impact of escapees at the ecosystem level in both mar- ine and freshwater systems. An understanding of the mechanisms of coexistence between native fishes and introduced non-native salmonids may be useful to design effective management strate- gies aimed at protecting native fish from salmonid introductions. A precautionary approach that encourages local artisanal and recreational fisheries to counteract colonization and naturalization of salmon species in southern Chile may constitute another management option.

AB  - Twelve commercial longline vessels, six Canadian and six U.S., were chartered by the International Pacifi c Halibut Commission for survey operations in 2009. During a combined 65 trips and 687 charter days, these vessels successfully completed 27 charter regions covering halibut habitat from southern Oregon to the island of Attu in the Aleutian Islands and north along the Bering Sea shelf edge. All 1,262 survey stations as well as all 18 rockfi sh index stations planned for 2009 were completed. Of the survey stations, 1,253 (99.3%) were considered successful for stock assessment analysis. Approximately 866,352 pounds of halibut, 241,999 pounds of Pacifi c cod, and 67,821 pounds of rockfi sh were landed from the standardized survey stations. Compared to the 2008 survey, WPUE decreased in Regulatory Areas 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4C, increased in Regulatory Areas 2C, 4B, and 4D, and remained unchanged in Regulatory Area 4A. Introduction The International Pacifi c Halibut Commission (IPHC; the Commission) standardized stock assessment (SSA) survey provides catch information and biological data that are independent of the commercial fi shery. These data, which are collected using standardized methods, bait, and gear during the summer of each year, provide an important comparison with data collected from the commercial fi shery. The survey fi shing effort, however, is a small fraction of the commercial effort and takes place only during the summer. The commercial fi shery is more variable in its gear composition and distribution of fi shing effort over time but presents a broad spatial and temporal sampling of the stock. Biological data collected on the surveys (e.g., the size, age, and sex composition of halibut) are used to monitor changes in biomass, growth, and mortality in adult and sub-adult components of the population. In addition, records of non-target species caught during survey operations provide insight into bait competition, rate of bait attacks, and serve as an index of abundance over time, making them valuable to the assessment, management, and avoidance of bycatch species. The Commission has conducted standardized setline surveys in selected areas during most years since 1963 (with a break from 1987 to 1992). Historical information regarding previous standardized survey operations has been presented in IPHC Annual Reports and Survey Manuals 1963-1965, 1976-1986, 1993-current; IPHC Report of Assessment and Research Activities (RARA) documents 1993-current; and IPHC Technical Report No. 18 (Hoag et al. 1980). The current base survey station design and most sampling protocols have been the same since 1998. Survey design and procedures The 2009 Standardized Stock Assessment Survey Manual (IPHC 2009b) (an in-house publication) provides complete details regarding all survey procedures including survey design, setting, hauling, and sampling protocols. Brief descriptions of the grid survey design and procedures follow. 554 IPHC REPORT OF ASSESSMENT AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES 2009 Design The 2009 survey design encompassed both nearshore and offshore waters of Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, southeast Alaska, the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and the Bering Sea continental shelf edge (Fig. 1). These areas were divided into 27 regions, each requiring between 17 and 40 charter days to complete. Stations were located at the intersections of a 10 nmi by 10 nmi square grid within the depth range occupied by Pacifi c halibut during summer months (25-275 fm in most areas). Experimental (ES) stations that did not follow the standard survey grid pattern were added in Southeast Alaska, where chartered vessels would otherwise have been required to spend an entire day fi shing an isolated station. As in previous years, data collected from these experimental stations are not used for stock assessment. The rockfi sh (Scorpaenidae) index stations in the Washington charter region, however, were arranged in a pattern different from the SSA design (described in the Special Projects section of this document). Figure 1 shows the s rvey station positions, charter region divisions, and regulatory areas surveyed in 2009. The current station layout has been in place since 1998, with the addition of extra stations in the Pribilof Islands beginning in 2006. Seven skates were fi shed at each station in all charter regions except for the rockfi sh index stations in the Washington charter region, where fi shing effort was limited to three skates per station to allay concerns about exceeding permitted yelloweye rockfi sh (Sebastes ruberrimus) catch. Setline survey specifi cations for gear and bait, as well as setting schedule and soak time are consistent among years. Standard survey gear consists of fi xed-hook, 1,800-foot skates with 100 16/0 circle hooks spaced 18 feet apart. Gangion length ranges from 24 to 48 inches. All hooks were baited with 0.25 to 0.33 pound pieces of Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute (ASMI) grade No. 2 semi-bright or better chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta). Each vessel set one to four stations daily (or up to fi ve stations if fi shing rockfi sh index stations) beginning at fi rst light, or around 0500 and soaked the gear at least fi ve hours before hauling. Soaking the gear at night was avoided whenever possible. Data from gear soaked longer than 24 hours were not used for assessment purposes. Sets were considered ineffective for stock assessment if predetermined limits for lost gear, snarls, predation, or displacement from predetermined station coordinates were exceeded. The fork lengths of all halibut captured at survey stations were recorded to the nearest centimeter; all lengths stated hereafter will be fork lengths. Each fork length was converted to an estimated weight using a standard formula, which was then used to generate the catch per unit effort (WPUE or weight per unit effort) data. Average WPUE, expressed as pounds per skate, was calculated by dividing the estimated catch in pounds (net weight) of halibut over 32 inches (O32 halibut) by the number of standardized skates hauled for each station and averaging these values for each area (statistical, charter, or regulatory). Sampling protocols Sea samplers collect data according to protocols established in the Survey Manual (IPHC 2009b) and the Bycatch Sampling Manual (IPHC 2009a). As the gear was set, IPHC samplers evaluated the performance of the bird avoidance devices and recorded the exact number of baits lost and hooks set per skate. During gear retrieval, samplers recorded hook status (e.g., empty, returned bait, species captured). Samplers in all areas ordinarily targeted the fi rst 20 consecutive hooks of each skate for monitoring hook status; however, processing needs for fi sh from previous skates, particularly in areas with high catch rates, sometimes affected where in the 100-hook sequence of the skate the sample was taken. In some areas, where sequential whole-haul hook

Up-Coast: Forests and Industry on British Columbia's North Coast, 1870-2005. Victoria, Canada: Royal BC Museum, 2006. 294 pp. Hardbound. ISBN: 0-7726-5460-3. $US49.95. [Richard A. Rajala. Clearcutting the Pacific Rain Forest: Production, Science, and Regulation. Vancouver: UBC Press, June 1998. 286 pp. Paperback. ISBN 0-7748-0591-9. $US 24.95] In Clearcutting the Pacific Rain Forest, Richard A. Rajala explored the roots of the deforestation crisis in the Douglas fir regions of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon between 1880 and 1965. In Up- Coast, the geographical scope is restricted to British Columbia's central and north coast from the Seymor inlet in the south to the Cassiar District in the North, and the Queen Charlotte Islands. The time scope, however, is prolonged from 1870 to early 2005. My original intent was to review only the most recently published of the books, but due to their complementary character, it seemed worthwhile to combine them for the sake of the review. The back cover of the new work promises that: Up-Coast presents the first comprehensive history of British Columbia's central-and-north-coast forest industry. This would, of course, be impossible for such a long time span (135 years) within less than 300 pages. Wisely, Rajala concentrates on one aspect, in this case wood procurement for the needs of the forest industry, starting from the first commercial sawmill on the north coast in operation by 1874, and ending with the needs of giant pulp-and-paper firms. For example, water pollution gets only a few lines of attention while the effects of forestry practices on salmon spawning grounds gets a bit more. Even so, every page of the book is fully packed with information, as Rajala takes us through several boom-and-bust cycles in the forest industry. We learn how the World Wars and, especially, how the need for airplane spruces affected the forest; we take a trip along the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and a boat trip with the International Woodworkers of America's Loggers' Navy. The book also works as a social history of the district, including both First Nations and other forest- or forestry-dependent local communities. I, and other readers not familiar with North American logging practices, would certainly need to read more about different logging and transporting methods presented in the book. Fortunately many of these are presented in detail in Clearcutting the Pacific Rain Forest. Now I know what a steam-donkey is, or how a cable logging system works. (I still, however, do not know how an A-frame works.) Up-Coast has a clear lesson for all resource-rich but capital-poor countries or regions. Providing cheap resources for companies to attract investments does not automatically generate welfare for the people and communities in the region, at least not in the long run. One of the reasons is that new labor-saving technology constantly eats up the employment benefits of increased production and logging. Clearcutting the Pacific Rain Forest concentrates on technology advances in logging operations, and how they transformed logging into an industrial operation. We also learn how flawed research supporting large- scale clear cutting survived as the results were convenient for short time industrial interests. Neither of the books are easy reads due to their massive amounts of detailed information, but both are well worth the effort. My only real reason for complaint is the use of endnotes instead of footnotes, which creates a lot of flipping back and forth. Luckily, in the endnotes for Clearcutting, each page heading clearly showed to which pages in the main text the notes referred, a nice feature which unfortunately was missing from the newer work.

The LCAs are on mealworms farmed in the Netherlands or France, fed on cereals or vegetable waste food and brewery side stream (four cases); and black soldier fly larvae farmed in Germany, fed on brewery side stream or brewery side stream with vegetable waste (two cases). The focus is on those insect proteins which can be utilised as fish feed with use in Norway as an example. Special attention is paid to obtain consistent system boundaries, method choices, background data, and indicators. The results show that the insect diet is crucial for all the analysed environmental indicators for insects fed a diet of high economic value vegetables. Emissions from the utilisation of insect manure for biogas, fertilisers or similar, and direct insect greenhouse gas emissions, seem to have little importance. The article further shows results compared with the greenhouse gas emissions for the most important salmon protein feed ingredients in Norway. Insect protein based on vegetables with low economic value has the potential to compete in environmental performance with existing protein sources for fish feed and can also cover 10 to 15% of the volumes of crude protein currently imported to the EU.</jats:p>

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate three canola protein products as partial replacements of steam-dried whole herring meal (HM) in a practical diet for juvenile chinook salmon in seawater. Groups of 30–40 g chinook salmon held in 9.5–12°C seawater on a natural photoperiod were fed one of seven equivalent protein (390 g kg−1) and isoenergetic (20 MJ gross energy kg−1) diets to satiation. Each of three test protein sources, namely, commercial canola meal (CM), low-temperature extruded CM (90°C; LT), and high-temperature extruded CM (150°C; HT) comprised about 120 and 240 g kg−1 of dietary protein by replacement of 15 and 30%, respectively, of the HM protein in the control diet. Chinook salmon growth and feed intake were markedly depressed by replacing HM protein with a high level of CM, but these responses were not lowered by replacement with LT and HT. The phytic acid content in commercial canola meal was reduced by about 10 and 30% from the original level by extrusion cooking at low (90°C) and high (150°C) temperature, respectively. Therefore, the diets containing HT still had significant amounts of phytic acid. Terminal whole-body zinc contents were inversely related to the dietary levels of the different canola protein products. Thyroid function was altered by CM but this effect was offset by heat treatment. The results suggest that extrusion cooking of CM improves its nutritive value for chinook salmon in seawater. Indeed, it was found that HT could comprise 240 g kg−1 of the dietary protein without adversely affecting performance.

AB  - <jats:p>The primary barrier to research into feed efficiency of Atlantic salmon (<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>) is the lack of a reliable method to assess individual feed intake in large cohorts of fish over a growth period. A method with potential is the X-ray method, which images radio-opaque markers (beads) in feed consumed by fish. However, the time taken to count the markers in the digestive tract of fish is extremely onerous and the method has previously been shown to have low repeatability. Furthermore, the method has not been assessed and optimized for Atlantic salmon. Firstly, we made use of image analysis to count beads within the digital radiographs, which was highly correlated to manual counting by human observers (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.99). Remarkably, image counting was up to 6 times faster than human counting when the number of beads per fish was high (&amp;gt; 300 per fish). We investigated the potential effect of different sources of error on the feed mass to bead count calibration equation and found the effects of X-ray exposure setting and the position of pellets on the X-ray plate to be negligible on the bead counts of both human and image analysis. We tested different feeding periods with the time of the X-ray images to minimize the loss of beads through defecation. We found that fish should be X-rayed within 6.5–11 hours of first being offered feed for a 6-hour feeding period which fed the entire daily ration. Lastly, we assessed the repeatability of feed intake over a 70-day growth period from 80–300 grams and found feed intake to be significantly and moderately repeatable (r = 0.45 ± 0.11), indicating developments in the method result in a consistent ranking of individual fish based on feed intake from three repeated measurements. The X-ray method combined with image analysis greatly reduces counting time without compromising accuracy, achieves promising repeatability, and is feasible in Atlantic salmon parr.</jats:p>

AB  - Piscirickettsia salmonis is one of the main infectious diseases affecting coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) farming, and current treatments have been ineffective for the control of this disease. Genetic improvement for P. salmonis resistance has been proposed as a feasible alternative for the control of this infectious disease in farmed fish. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) strategies allow genotyping of hundreds of individuals with thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be used to perform genome wide association studies (GWAS) and predict genetic values using genome-wide information. We used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to dissect the genetic architecture of resistance against P. salmonis in a farmed coho salmon population and to identify molecular markers associated with the trait. We also evaluated genomic selection (GS) models in order to determine the potential to accelerate the genetic improvement of this trait by means of using genome-wide molecular information. A total of 764 individuals from 33 full-sib families (17 highly resistant and 16 highly susceptible) were experimentally challenged against P. salmonis and their genotypes were assayed using ddRAD sequencing. A total of 9,389 SNPs markers were identified in the population. These markers were used to test genomic selection models and compare different GWAS methodologies for resistance measured as day of death (DD) and binary survival (BIN). Genomic selection models showed higher accuracies than the traditional pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) method, for both DD and BIN. The models showed an improvement of up to 95% and 155% respectively over PBLUP. One SNP related with B-cell development was identified as a potential functional candidate associated with resistance to P. salmonis defined as DD.

AB  - In early September 2003, >3.0 × 105 cells l−1 of Alexandrium fundyense were detected in close proximity to salmon aquaculture sites near Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, eastern Canada. High concentrations persisted throughout the month, peaking to >8 × 105 cells l−1 on 18 September. Concurrently, some salmon farms in the area experienced elevated mortalities. Although the cause of mortality is not yet fully understood, it appears to be related to the high concentrations of A. fundyense. Paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins were not detected in the edible flesh of salmon (by mouse bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography), but were detected at low levels in viscera and gills. Blue mussels Mytilus edulis analysed from areas affected by the bloom reached levels of 18 000μg STX equivalents 100g−1 of tissue. As a result of the salmon mortalities, a project was initiated to establish a monitoring approach for harmful algal blooms to provide an early warning of potential events and to act as a...

AB  - Triploidisation represents several advantages (e.g. sterility) and therefore is routinely applied in aquaculture of several commercially important fish species, including rainbow trout. The comparative transcriptomic analysis of ovaries of triploid (3N) and diploid (2N) female rainbow trout revealed a total of 9 075 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 4 105 genes upregulated in 2N and 4 970 genes upregulated in 3N ovaries, respectively). Identified clusters for DEGs upregulated in 3N and 2N ovaries were different, including carbohydrate and lipid metabolic process and transport, protein modification, signalling (related to folliculogenesis) and response to stimulus for DEGs upregulated in 2N, and developmental process, signalling (related to apoptosis, cellular senescence and adherence junctions) and regulation of RNA metabolic process for DEGs upregulated in 3N. The enrichment of processes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in 2N ovaries indicated high metabolism of ovarian tissue and the energy reservoir generation indispensable during the earliest stages of development. Our results highlight the importance of oocyte hydration along with oestrogen, insulin, leptin, fibroblast growth factor, and Notch signalling and pathways related to the regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in proper oocyte meiotic maturation prior to ovulation in 2N ovaries. Conversely, triploidisation may lead to an increase in ovarian cellular senescence and apoptosis, which in turn can result in abnormal gonadal morphology and fibrosis. The downregulation of genes responsible for the precise regulation of meiosis and proper chromosome segregation during meiosis probably affects meiotic maturation via irregular meiotic division of chromosomes. The induction of triploidy of the rainbow trout genome resulted in enhanced expression of male-specific genes, genes responsible for re-establishing the transcriptional balance after genome reorganisation and genes involved in regulatory mechanisms, including gene silencing and DNA methylation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide investigation providing in-depth comprehensive and comparative gene expression patterns in the ovary from 2N and 3N rainbow trout females helping in elucidating the molecular mechanisms leading to impaired gonadal development and sterility of female triploids.

AB  - Vibrio anguillarum infections result in huge economic losses in the aquaculture industry annually. Pleurocidin, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) isolated in 1997 from winter flounder, exhibited MICs in the micromolar range against a wide variety of fish and human pathogens [1]. Studies have shown a correlation between antimicrobial activity and the charges, hydrophobicities, and hydrophobic moments of amphipathic peptides that are capable of adopting an α-helical structure [2]. Although the C-terminal acid is the naturally-occurring form, synthetic pleurocidin amide is more potent and has been shown to protect coho salmon from vibriosis in vivo [3]. No additional increase in potency was obtained by adding a lysine at the N-terminus of pleurocidin amide to increase the positive charge on the peptide [3]. To characterize the structural determinants required for antimicrobial activity and to discover minimal sequences for genetic engineering, we synthesized pleurocidin amide and two new pleurocidin analogs LM4–1 and LM4–2 (see Figure 1). The analogs were truncated at the C-terminus to determine if any residues in this region could be deleted and yet retain activity. Peptide LM4–1 lacked seven C-terminal residues and also one of the pair of phenylalanines found at positions 5/6 in native pleurocidin. This deletion moved a positively-charged lysine pair up to positions 6/7, thereby giving the N-terminus of LM4–1 an amphipathic pattern similar to that responsible for helix formation in cecropin A [4]. AMPs were screened against E. coli, V. anguillarum, and V. carchariae.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture is the fastest growing animal protein production system in the world; however, intensive farming leads to poor weight gain, stress, and disease outbreaks. Probiotics offer the potential to enhance growth performance and feed efficiency in Atlantic salmon, as well as immunostimulate fish against common pathogens, benefitting farmers and consumers with more efficient production. Here, we isolated and identified 900 native microbial isolates including 18 Lactobacilli from the farmed salmon intestines. Based on whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the Lactobacillus candidates belonged to Latilactobacillus curvatus (L. curvatus) species and formed two distinct phylogenetic groups. Using bioinformatics and in vitro analyses, we selected two candidates L. curvatus ATCC PTA-127116 and L. curvatus ATCC PTA-127117, which showed desirable safety and probiotic properties. The two L. curvatus candidates were evaluated for safety and efficacy (higher final weight) in Atlantic salmon alongside spore-forming Bacilli isolated from salmon, poultry, and swine. All the tested candidates were safe to salmon with no adverse effects. While we did not see efficacy in any Bacillus supplemented groups, compared to untreated group, the group administered with the two L. curvatus strains consortium in feed for seven weeks in freshwater showed indicators of improvement in final body weight by 4.2%. Similarly, the two L. curvatus candidates were also evaluated for safety and efficacy in Atlantic salmon in saltwater; the group administered with the two L. curvatus strains consortium in feed for 11 weeks showed indicators of improvement in final body weight by 4.7%. Comprehensive metabolomics analyses in the presence of different prebiotics and/or additives identified galactooligosaccharide as a potential prebiotic to enhance the efficacy of two L. curvatus candidates. All together, these data provide comprehensive genomic, phenotypic and metabolomic evidence of safety and desirable probiotic properties as well as indicators of in vivo efficacy of two novel endogenous L. curvatus candidates for potential probiotic applications in Atlantic salmon. The in vivo findings need to be confirmed in larger performance studies, including field trials.

AB  - Although fish is a healthy alternative for meat, it can be a vehicle for mercury (Hg), including in its most toxic organic form, methylmercury (MeHg). The objective of the present study was to estimate the risk to human health caused by the consumption of sushi and sashimi as commercialized by Japanese food restaurants in the city of Campinas (SP, Brazil). The total Hg content was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition and amalgamation, and the MeHg content calculated considering that 90% of the total Hg is in the organic form. The health risk was estimated from the values for the provisional tolerable weekly ingestion (PTWI) by both adults and children. The mean concentrations for total Hg were: 147.99, 6.13, and 3.42 µg kg ⁻¹ in the tuna, kani, and salmon sushi samples, respectively, and 589.09, 85.09, and 11.38 µg kg ⁻¹ in the tuna, octopus and salmon sashimi samples, respectively. The tuna samples showed the highest Hg concentrations. One portion of tuna sashimi exceeded the PTWI value for MeHg established for children and adults. The estimate of risk for human health indicated that the level of toxicity depended on the type of fish and size of the portion consumed.

AB  - Seven thermal spring sites in Alaska were investigated as possible locations for the construction of a salmon hatchery to test and demonstrate the potential applications of geothermal energy in the aquaculture of these fish. Investigations consisted of identifying candidate thermal springs and evaluating the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of each site to determine its potential for salmon aquaculture. The seven sites studied included Akutan in the Aleutian Islands, False Pass, Port Moller and Mother Goose Lake on the Alaska Peninsula, Ophir Creek in the Kilbuck Mountains northeast of Bethel plus Bailey, and Bell islands north of Ketchikan in southeastern Alaska. Each site is described according to its physical character, water resources, biological aspects, hatchery application, and construction feasibility. The Bell Island site appears to be the best candidate for a pilot hatchery program utilizing geothermal energy. Additional in-depth engineering/hydrologic and biological studies are recommended. All sites are discussed with conclusions and recommendations presented.

AB  - Aquaculture contributes to the global animal protein supply and the prevention of malnutrition and diet-related diseases (FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations); Fiorella et al., 2021). In particular, fish is a significant source of animal protein, fatty acids (e.g., docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid), vitamins, and essential trace elements in the human diet. Nonetheless, fish bioaccumulates metals from their diet and habitat. This data article includes information on the concentrations of 4 essential and 4 non-essential trace elements in cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the human health risks through fish consumption in the adult population. Concentrations of four essential (Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn) and four non-essential (As, Cd, Pb, and Hg) elements were quantified in ninety-one O. mykiss samples from an in-door production system. Total mercury (THg) levels in samples were determined by AAS, and other analyzed trace elements were measured by ICP-OES after microwave-assisted acid digestion. The highest concentrations of metals/metalloid (mg/kg wet weight) in fish muscle were Cr (0.44), Cu (4.21), Ni (1.01), As (0.47), Cd (0.045), Pb (0.65), THg (0.029), and Zn (6.21). The average concentrations of Cr and Pb exceeded their respective maximum limit. In most cases, median metal concentrations significantly (p < 0.05) differed across the fish size groups (small: 264-295 mm; medium: 300-395 mm; and large: 400-552 mm). The median concentrations of Cd, Zn, and THg in the large size group differed significantly (p < 0.05) between genders. The estimated weekly intake values of quantified elements from muscle were below the provisional tolerable weekly intakes. Non-carcinogenic risk assessment in adult consumers, being below one (THQ ≤ 1; and TTHQ ≤ 1), indicated an insignificant health hazard. The estimated incremental and cumulative cancer risks in the adult class through Cr, As, Ni, and Pb exposure were greater than the benchmark (10-5). Accordingly, high dietary intake of metals/metalloid from cultured O. mykiss posed a risk of carcinogenesis in the adult risk class.

AB  - Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is the aetiological agent of a highly contagious disease that affects farmed salmonids. IPNV isolates have been phylogenetically classified into eight genogroups, of which two are present in Chile, genogroups 1 and 5. Here, we compare the mortality rate caused by isolates from both genogroups in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fry to determine if there is an association between host susceptibility and phylogenetic characterization of IPNV. Fish were challenged by immersion with one of four isolates (two for each genogroup), and mortality curves were assessed after 30 days. Viral load was measured in all mortalities and in live fish sampled at 1, 7 and 20 days post-infection. Although mortality was low throughout the challenge, differences were found between fish infected with different isolates. Both isolates from genogroup 1 caused greater cumulative mortalities than either of the isolates from genogroup 5. When combined, the overall mortality rate of fish challenged with genogroup 1 isolates was significantly higher than those infected with genogroup 5. However, viral load was lower on trout infected with genogroup 1 isolates. These results suggest that rainbow trout are more susceptible to IPNV isolates from genogroup 1 than genogroup 5.

AB  - We describe the finding of a novel viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) Genotype III strain that caused disease of both a neurological and septicaemic nature in seawater-farmed rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in Storfjorden, Norway. In November 2007, an outbreak of VHS associated with slightly elevated mortality was confirmed at a seawater site rearing rainbow trout (90 to 440 g). Within 3 to 4 mo, the disease was recognised in 3 neighbouring sea sites with ongrowing rainbow trout. The clinical, gross pathological and histopathological findings were in accordance with VHS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of VHSV in brain and internal tissues by immunohistochemistry, cell culture and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Sequence analysis of the G-gene revealed that the isolated virus clustered with VHSV Genotype III and that the Norwegian isolate represents a unique strain of VHSV. The pathogenicity of the virus strain to rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar was examined using infection experiments. In immersion trials, the Norwegian isolate produced a cumulative mortality of 70% in rainbow trout, while nearly 100% mortality was obtained after intraperitoneal injection of the virus. For Atlantic salmon, no mortality was observed in immersion trials, whereas 52% mortality was observed after intraperitoneal injection. The Norwegian isolate thus represents the first VHSV of Genotype III pathogenic to rainbow trout.

AB  - <i>Piscine orthoreovirus</i> (PRV) is a pathogen that causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation in <i>Salmo salar</i> and has also been linked to circulatory disorders in other farmed salmonids, such as <i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i> and <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>. The virus has a segmented, double-stranded RNA genome, which makes it possible to undergo genetic reassortment and increase its genomic diversity through point mutations. In this study, genetic reassortment in PRV was assessed using the full genome sequences available in public databases. This study used full genome sequences that were concatenated and genome-wide reassortment events, and phylogenetic analyses were performed using the recombination/reassortment detection program version 5 (RDP5 V 5.5) software. Additionally, each segment was aligned codon by codon, and overall mean distance and selection was tested using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis X software, version 10.2 (MEGA X version 10.2). The results showed that there were 17 significant reassortment events in 12 reassortant sequences, involving genome exchange between low and highly virulent genotypes. PRV sequences from different salmonid host species did not appear to limit the reassortment. This study found that PRV frequently undergoes reassortment events to increase the diversity of its segmented genome, leading to antigenic variation and increased virulence. This study also noted that to date, no reassortment events have been described between PRV-1 and PRV-3 genotypes. However, the number of complete genomic sequences within each genotype is uneven. This is important because PRV-3 induces cross-protection against PRV-1, making it a potential vaccine candidate.

AB  - <i>Ex situ</i> amphibian populations can experience reproductive dysfunction due to the absence of environmental cues that trigger reproductive events. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for amphibians, specifically exogenous hormone regimens, can circumvent these external signals to induce gametogenesis and gamete release. Currently, the use of the mammalian reproductive hormones gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are used in a species-specific manner to stimulate amphibian breeding. Hormones or hormone mixtures that are effective in all breeding scenarios would provide the best option for conservation practitioners and some commercial products are already in use for breeding other ectotherms. Ovaprim®, which contains salmon GnRH analogue (sGnRHa) and the dopamine antagonist domperidone (DOM), is effective in fish aquaculture and may be effective for amphibians. To test this hypothesis, we treated Fowler's toads (<i>Anaxyrus fowleri</i>) with either sGnRHa alone, a high or low dose of Ovaprim® or hCG. We then compared spermiation response, sperm quantity and quality parameters, and changes in animal mass over time within each treatment. We found administration of Ovaprim® resulted in more males producing sperm with better motility compared to administration of sGnRHa alone. In addition, the Ovaprim® and sGnRHa treatments resulted in lower response rates, lower sperm motilities, more abnormal sperm, and higher aggregations of sperm compared to the hCG treatment. Furthermore, Ovaprim®-treated males gained significant mass, suggesting an anti-diuretic effect of DOM. Together, these results show that neither Ovaprim® nor sGnRHa, at the concentrations tested, are likely suitable replacements for hCG in <i>ex situ</i> bufonid breeding programmes and that hormone mixtures developed for fish may have limited transferability to new world toad species.

AB  -   A new tensile strength method was developed to quantify the force required to tear a standardized block of Atlantic salmon muscle with the aim of identifying those samples more prone to factory downgrading as a result of softness and fillet gaping. The new method effectively overcomes problems of sample attachment encountered with previous tensile strength tests. The repeatability and sensitivity and predictability of the new technique were evaluated against other common instrumental texture measurement methods. The relationship between sensory assessments of firmness and parameters from the instrumental texture methods was also determined. Data from the new method were shown to have the strongest correlations with gaping severity (r =−0.514, P < 0.001) and the highest level of repeatability of data when analyzing cold-smoked samples. The Warner Bratzler shear method gave the most repeatable data from fresh samples and had the highest correlations between fresh and smoked product from the same fish (r = 0.811, P < 0.001). A hierarchical cluster analysis placed the tensile test in the top cluster, alongside the Warner Bratzler method, demonstrating that it also yields adequate data with respect to these tests. None of the tested sensory analysis attributes showed significant relationships to mechanical tests except fillet firmness, with correlations (r) of 0.42 for cylinder probe maximum force (P = 0.005) and 0.31 for tensile work (P = 0.04). It was concluded that the tensile test method developed provides an important addition to the available tools for mechanical analysis of salmon quality, particularly with respect to the prediction of gaping during factory processing, which is a serious commercial problem. Practical Application: A novel, reliable method of measuring flesh tensile strength in salmon, provides data of relevance to gaping.

AB  - The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment. This risk profile was developed following the Codex Guidelines for Risk Analysis of Foodborne Antimicrobial Resistance with the objectives of describing the current state of knowledge of ESBL-EB in relation to retail shrimp and salmon available to consumers in Canada, the primary aquacultured species consumed in Canada. The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. Although the information available did not permit the conclusion as to whether there is a human health risk related to ESBLs in Enterobacterales in salmon and shrimp available for consumption by Canadians, ESBL-EB in imported seafood available at the retail level in Canada have been found. Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products.

The fast growth rates achieved in ideal conditions make RAS projects highly profitable, with an internal rate of return (IRR) of up to 30%. However, several factors need to be considered when evaluating the investment efficiency, including growth periods, mortality rates, feed conversion ratios, and fish purging before slaughter. The high energy consumption required to power pumps and chillers for water cooling adds to the operational costs of RAS farms, and designing farms should be done to align with ESG principles. The article outlines the main principles that should be taken into account when considering investment in RAS salmon farming projects.</jats:p>

AB  - Salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) is a contagious disease caused by Piscirickettsia salmonis, an intracellular bacterium. SRS causes an estimated economic loss of $700 million USD to the Chilean industry annually. Vaccination and antibiotic therapy are the primary prophylactic and control measures used against SRS. Unfortunately, commercially available SRS vaccines have not been shown to have a significant effect on reducing mortality. Most vaccines contain whole inactivated bacteria which results in decreased efficacy due to the limited ability of the vaccine to evoke a cellular mediated immune response that can eliminate the pathogen or infected cells. In addition, SRS vaccine efficacy has been evaluated primarily with Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon). Vaccine studies using Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) are scarce, despite SRS being the leading cause of infectious death for this species. In this study, we evaluate an injectable vaccine based on P. salmonis proteoliposome; describing the vaccine security profile, capacity to induce specific anti-P. salmonis IgM and gene expression of immune markers related to T CD8 cell-mediated immunity. Efficacy was determined by experimental challenge with P. salmonis intraperitoneally. Our findings indicate that a P. salmonis proteoliposome-based vaccine is able to protect O. mykiss against challenge with a P. salmonis Chilean isolate and causes a specific antibody response. The transcriptional profile suggests that the vaccine is capable of inducing cellular immunity. This study provides new insights into O. mykiss protection and the immune response induced by a P. salmonis proteoliposome-based vaccine.

AB  - Lipidomics methodologies traditionally utilize either reverse phase- or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-type separations; however, supercritical fluid chromatography can offer a rapid normal phase type separation while reducing the dependence on organic solvents. However, normal phase type lipid separations typically lack pronounced intraclass separation, which is problematic for complex lipidomes containing very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those from genetically modified organisms. A high-strength silica C18 method was developed, which benefitted from discrete class separation, as well as displaying intraclass selectivity sufficient for profiling flesh of salmon fed with a diet supplemented with oil from the genetically engineered oilseed Camelina sativa, a terrestrial oilseed with a fish oil-type profile. Salmon fed a diet containing this Camelina oil were found to have flesh enriched in triacylglycerols and phospholipids containing 18:3, 20:5, and 22:6, whereas salmon fed the control diet were differentiated by shorter chain plant-type fatty acids integrated within complex lipids. Coupled with active scanning quadrupole technology, data acquisition was enhanced, allowing for fragmentation data to be acquired in a data independent fashion, permitting acyl chain identification of resolved isomers. Therefore, we have developed a method, which is amenable for lipidomics studies of complex lipidomes, specifically those altered by synthetic biology approaches.

AB  - The microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract heavily influences the health, growth and survival of fish. Probiotics have proved effective in improving fish productivity in aquaculture. Research suggests that probiotics, supplemented in the feed, may elicit these benefits by altering the ecology of the gastrointestinal microbiota. The probiotic Pediococcus acidilactici has been successfully used for terrestrial animals and humans but its use in aquatic organisms has been less researched. In the present study, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) were fed a diet that contained Ped. Acidilactici, or a control diet. Analysis of the posterior digesta bacteria, using a non-culture dependant technique, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), showed that Ped. acidilactici had some effects on the ecology of the microbiota but this was not statistically significant compared to controls. This study suggests that Ped. acidilactici must be fed at a dose above the manufacturer’s recommended dose, of 10 6 CFU g -1 of feed, for more than four weeks for significant changes in the microbiota to occur.

AB  - The ability of poultry products to replace fish meal in diets for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, depends on their nutrient composition, cost, and consistency. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of three commercially available poultry products (chicken concentrate, CC, poultry by-product blend, PBB; or chicken and egg concentrate, CE) to maintain growth and disease resistance when substituted for fish meal in a rainbow trout starter diet. A control diet was formulated to contain 48% crude protein and 18% crude lipid; 100% of the fish meal in test diets was replaced with CC, PBB, or CE. At stocking, fry were counted into groups (50 fish/tank) with six replicate tanks for each diet and fed their respective diets four times daily for 8 wk. All the poultry-based diets supported growth (over 1600% increase over initial weight), nutrient retention, and feed conversion ratios of rainbow trout fry equal to or greater than those observed for fry fed with the fish meal-based diet. No effect of diet on survival was observed following subcutaneous injection challenge with Flavobacterium psychrophilum. These data suggest that the examined products can be used in place of fish meal for rainbow trout fry without lowering growth and disease resistance.

AB  - There is a growing scientific and legislative consensus that fish are sentient, and therefore have the capacity to experience pain and suffering. The assessment of the welfare of farmed fish is challenging due to the aquatic environment and the number of animals housed together. However, with increasing global production and intensification of aquaculture comes greater impetus for developing effective tools which are suitable for the aquatic environment to assess the emotional experience and welfare of farmed fish. This study therefore aimed to investigate the use of Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA), originally developed for terrestrial farmed animals, in farmed salmon and evaluate its potential for use as a welfare monitoring tool. QBA is a ‘whole animal’ approach based on the description and quantification of the expressive qualities of an animal’s dynamic style of behaving, using descriptors such as relaxed, agitated, lethargic, or confident. A list of twenty qualitative descriptors was generated by fish farmers after viewing video-footage showing behaviour expressions representative of the full repertoire of salmon in this context. A separate, non-experienced group of ten observers subsequently watched twenty-five video clips of farmed salmon, and scored the twenty descriptors for each clip using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). To assess intra-observer reliability each observer viewed the same twenty-five video clips twice, in two sessions 10 days apart, with the second clip set presented in different order. The observers were unaware that the two sets of video clips were identical. Data were analysed using Principal Component (PC) Analysis (correlation matrix, no rotation), revealing four dimensions that together explained 79% of the variation between video clips, with PC1 (tense/anxious/skittish – calm/mellow/relaxed) explaining the greatest percentage of variation (56%). PC1 was the only dimension to show acceptable inter- and intra-observer reliability, and mean PC1 scores correlated significantly to durations of slow and erratic physical movements measured for the same 25 video clips. Further refinements to the methodology may be necessary, but this study is the first to provide evidence for the potential of Qualitative Behavioural Assessment to serve as a time-efficient welfare assessment tool for juvenile salmon under farmed conditions.

AB  - Summary Intensive aquaculture conditions expose fish to bacterial infections, leading to significant financial losses, extensive antibiotic use and risk of antibiotic resistance in target bacteria. Flavobacterium columnare causes columnaris disease in aquaculture worldwide. To develop a bacteriophage-based control of columnaris disease, we isolated and characterized 126 F. columnare strains and 63 phages against F. columnare from Finland and Sweden. Bacterial isolates were virulent on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and fell into four previously described genetic groups A, C, E and G, with genetic groups C and E being the most virulent. Phage host range studied against a collection of 228 bacterial isolates demonstrated modular infection patterns based on host genetic group. Phages infected contemporary and previously isolated bacterial hosts, but bacteria isolated most recently were generally resistant to previously isolated phages. Despite large differences in geographical origin, isolation year or host range of the phages, whole genome sequencing of 56 phages showed high level of genetic similarity to previously isolated F. columnare phages (Ficleduovirus, Myoviridae). Altogether, this phage collection demonstrates a potential to be used in phage therapy. Significance Statement Bacteriophages were discovered already over a century ago, and used widely in treatment of bacterial diseases before the era of antibiotics. Due to harmful effects of antibiotic leakage into environment, aquaculture is a potential target for phage therapy. However, the development of efficient phage therapy approach requires detailed characterization of bacterial pathogen virulence and phage host range. Here, we describe phage-bacterium interactions in the fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare. We found that genetically similar phages are found from different fish farms, and their infectivity cluster according to genetic group of bacteria. In addition, phages were able to infect bacterial hosts from other farms, which is a preferable trait considering phage therapy approach. However, the most recently isolated phages had broader host range than the previously isolated phages, suggesting a response in the phage community to evolution of resistance in the bacteria. These results show that designing phage therapy for aquaculture (and other) systems needs consideration of both temporal and geographical aspects of the phage-bacterium interaction.

AB  - The present study reports measured levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in commercial salmon feed (n = 8) and farmed Atlantic, coho, and chinook salmon (n = 110), as well as wild coho, chinook, chum, sockeye, and pink salmon (n = 91). Flesh residue concentrations (ng/g wet weight) of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordanes, chlorobenzenes (CBz) and cyclodiene pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, mirex) were 2 to 11 times higher (p   105). Surprisingly, less hydrophobic pesticides such as hexachlorocyclohexanes and endosulfans (KOWs   5). This is contrary to previous laboratory and field observations demonstrating fish BMFs less than 1 for low KOW chemicals, because of efficient respiratory elimination of those compounds via gills. The results suggest that ambient seawater concentrations and bioconcentration-driven accumulation may play a key role in the bioaccumulation of these relatively more water-soluble contaminants in farmed salmon. Finally, OCP exposure through consumption of British Columbian salmon is found to be low relative to United States national average per capita total exposure levels and provisional tolerable daily intakes.

AB  - Summary 1. Pathogen transmission from open net-pen aquaculture facilities can depress sympatric wild fish populations. However, little is known about the effects of pathogen transmission from farmed fish on species interactions or other ecosystem components. Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch smolts are susceptible hosts to the parasitic salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis as well as a primary predator of juvenile pink Oncorhynchus gorbuscha salmon, a major host species for lice. 2. We used a hierarchical model of stock-recruit dynamics to compare coho salmon population dynamics across a region that varies in salmon louse infestation of juvenile coho and their pink salmon prey. 3. During a period of recurring salmon louse infestations in a region of open net-pen salmon farms, coho salmon productivity (recruits per spawner at low spawner abundance) was depressed approximately sevenfold relative to unexposed populations. Alternate hypotheses for the observed difference in productivity, such as declines in coho prey, perturbations to freshwater habitat or stochasticity, are unlikely to explain this pattern. 4. Lice parasitizing juvenile coho salmon were likely to be trophically transmitted during predation on parasitized juvenile pink salmon as well as directly transmitted from salmon farms. 5. Synthesis and applications. The finding that species interactions may cause the effects of pathogen transmission from farmed to wild fish to propagate up a marine food web has important conservation implications: (i) the management of salmon aquaculture should consider and account for species interactions and the potential for these interactions to intensify pathogen transmission from farmed to wild fish, (ii) the ecosystem impact of louse transmission from farmed to wild salmon has likely to have been previously underestimated and (iii) comprehensive monitoring of wild salmon and their population dynamics in areas of intensive salmon aquaculture should be a priority to determine if open net-pen salmon aquaculture is ecologically sustainable.

AB  - The skin of the teleost is a flexible and scaled structure that protects the fish toward the external environment. The outermost surface of the skin is coated with mucus, which is believed to be colonized by a diverse bacterial community (commensal and/or opportunistic). Little is known about such communities and their role in fish welfare. In aquaculture, fish seem to be more susceptible to pathogens compared to wild fish. Indeed common fish farming practices may play important roles in promoting their vulnerability, possibly by causing changes to their microbiomes. In the present study, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was employed to analyze the composition of the farmed Salmo salar skin-mucus microbiome before and after netting and transfer. The composition of the bacterial community present in the rearing water was also investigated in order to evaluate its correlation with the community present on the fish skin. Our results reveal variability of the skin-mucus microbiome among the biological replicates before fish handling. On the contrary, after fish handling, the skin-mucus community exhibited structural similarity among the biological replicates and significant changes were observed in the bacterial composition compared to the fish analyzed prior to netting and transfer. Limited correlation was revealed between the skin-mucus microbiome and the bacterial community present in the rearing water. Finally, analysis of skin-mucus bacterial biomasses indicated low abundance for some samples, highlighting the need of caution when interpreting community data due to the possible contamination of water-residing bacteria.

AB  - The upsurge in havoc being wreaked by antibiotic-resistant bacteria has led to an urgent need for efficacious alternatives to antibiotics. This study assessed the antibacterial efficacy of two isobutyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles (iBCA-NPs), D6O and NP30, against major bacterial pathogens of fish. In vivo tests on rainbow trout were preceded by in vitro tests of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). NP30 exhibited higher efficacy than D60, but both iBCA-NPs demonstrated dose-dependent and species-specific in vitro antibacterial properties against the bacterial isolates. Generally, Gram-negative bacteria were more resistant to the iBCA-NPs. <i>Streptococcus iniae</i>, <i>Tenacibaculum maritimum</i>, and <i>Photobacterium damselae</i> were particularly sensitive to both iBCA-NPs. Administered to rainbow trout at 3571.4 mg (iBCA-NP)/kg feed, the iBCA-NPs produced a relative gain rate and survival rates comparable to the control (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The condition factor and the hepatosomatic and viscerosomatic indices of fish were indifferentiable (<i>p</i> > 0.05) between the iBCA-NP groups and the control. The iBCA-NPs caused no alteration in stress, oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, SOD), plasma complement titer, or lysozyme activity. This study presents the first report of antibacterial activity of iBCA-NPs against Gram-negative bacteria. The results of this study suggest that D60 and NP30 may contribute to reducing the amounts of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents used in aquaculture.

AB  - The use of genomic information has been proven to be a highly effective in predicting genomic breeding values (GEBV) across various species, including aquatic organisms. In the Finnish national rainbow trout breeding programme, the integration of genomic selection holds particular significance for the traits recorded on sibling fish reared in the main commercial sea production environment, given the selection occurs among the breeding candidates reared in the freshwater nucleus. In the programme, family tanks allow to maintain a pedigree for a large number of fish, and genotyping of a portion of the fish accompanied with a single-step genomic evaluation (ssGBLUP) would maintain high selection intensity and simultaneously make use of possibilities of genomic selection. In this study we used three different statistical approaches to quantify the selection accuracy of ssGBLUP evaluation of body weight and maturity age, relative to the evaluation based on the traditional sire-dam-offspring pedigree (PBLUP). The data included 600,409 fish in the pedigree among which 214,410 and 4573 were phenotyped for the reported traits and genotyped, respectively. Firstly, a phenotypic cross validation study showed that ssGBLUP had a slightly better prediction power for body weight and maturity age recorded at the sea, with an average 2.7% relative increase in accuracy compared to PBLUP. Secondly, a linear regression (LR) of GEBVs computed using either full or reduced dataset demonstrated that the ssGBLUP model had a consistently lower bias and dispersion compared to the PBLUP model, underscoring its efficacy in dealing with complex datasets like ours. When considering the reliability of [G]EBV predictions, the use of ssGBLUP model resulted in a significant improvement. There is, on average, a notable 50% relative increase in the reliability of predictions for the sea-recorded traits. Thirdly, the enhancement in reliability was further evidenced by the individual assessment of [G]EBVs computed using the reverse reliability methodology. Notably, genotyped individuals experienced an average increase of 0.27 units in reliability, while ungenotyped individuals experienced a corresponding increase of 0.03 units. The results show that the ssGBLUP method had higher prediction accuracy for both sea and freshwater traits compared to PBLUP. The developed ssGBLUP model will be instrumental in Finland's rainbow trout breeding, facilitating precise and efficient selection of new candidates.

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry in the world and it accounts for roughly half of the world's fish supply. The majority of global aquaculture production occurs in freshwater systems that are increasingly subject to multiple uses by different stakeholders. Given the overall scarcity of freshwater on a global scale, freshwater aquaculture will face increasing environmental constraints that will demand an ever better understanding of its potential impacts on the aquatic environment and human health. This thesis consists of a series of studies that, collectively, contribute to further our understanding on the effects of freshwater aquaculture effluents on aquatic ecosystems, on the effects and environmental safety of antibiotics used in freshwater aquaculture on aquatic bacterial communities and on the link between antibiotic pollution and antibiotic resistance. Chapter 2 reviews the effects of freshwater aquaculture effluents on stream ecosystems using land-based salmonid farms as a case study. In this chapter I discuss relevant considerations related to the temporal and spatial scales of effluent discharge and ecological effects that highlight the need to characterize the patterns of stressor discharge when assessing environmental impacts and designing ecological effects studies. I also discuss the potential role of multiple stressors - with an emphasis on veterinary medicines - in disrupting ecosystem structure and function. Overall, the critical analysis presented in this chapter indicates that further research on the effects of veterinary medicines using relevant exposure scenarios would significantly contribute to our understanding of their impact in relation to other effluent stressors. Chapter 3 is a general methods chapter that describes the stream microcosm system used to assess the effects of erythromycin thiocyanate (ERT) and florfenicol (FFC) on bacterial communities of stream biofilms. This chapter presents the results of preliminary experiments whose results provided relevant information on the overall operation of the microcosms and on the variability of major physical and biological variables. This information guided the experimental designs used to assess the effects of FFC and ERT on the bacterial community structure of stream biofilms. Chapter 4 presents the results of the experiment conducted to assess the effects of FFC on the bacterial community structure of developing biofilms. The objective was to assess changes in bacterial community structure along a gradient of FFC concentrations that could provide insight into the type and magnitude of effects that could be expected from episodic exposure of stream biofilms to FFC in headwater streams. At 10 and 20 days of biofilm development, bacterial community structure differentiated in a pattern consistent with the FFC concentration gradient and there was a positive relationship between bacterial richness and bacterial diversity with FFC concentration. At 15 days of biofilm development there was also a positive relationship between…

AB  - The sustainable growth of fish aquaculture will require the procurement of non-marine feed sources. Glycerol is a potential feed supplement whose metabolism may spare the catabolism of dietary amino acids, thereby extending the use of the feed protein to other physiological functions such as growth. In the present study, the effects of dietary glycerol supplementation on the muscle and liver metabolomes of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were evaluated. Fish juveniles were fed diets with 0%, 2.5%, and 5% glycerol. Muscle and liver aqueous fractions were extracted and 1H NMR spectra were acquired. Metabolite profiles derived from the 1H NMR signals were assessed using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. The adenylate energy charge was determined in the muscle. For both species, the muscle metabolite profile showed more variability compared to that of the liver and was most perturbed by the 5.0% glycerol diet. For the liver metabolite profile, rainbow trout showed fewer differences compared to European seabass. No differences were observed in energy charge between experimental groups for either species. Thus, rainbow trout appeared to be less susceptible to tissue metabolite perturbations, compared to seabass, when the diet was supplemented with up to 5% glycerol.

AB  - Chloramine-T is a widely used disinfectant for the treatment of gill diseases of fish in freshwater, and more recently attention has turned to its use in seawater. However, despite the wide use of chloramine-T, few studies have examined its toxicity to fish. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine the effects of disinfection by Chloramine-T on the muscle tissue of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) using oxidative stress biomarkers (levels of 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and derivatives of oxidatively modified proteins) and biochemical enzymes’ activity (alanine- and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) to observe the its toxic effects. The endpoints obtained from this study will be useful to monitor the effects of disinfectant bathing with Chloramine-T for this species of fish. In the disinfectant group, rainbow trout (n = 11) were exposed to Chloramine-T in final concentration of 9 mg per L. Control group of trout (n = 11) was handled with water from basin in the same way as Chloramine-T exposed group. Fish were bathed with Chloramine-T for 20 min and repeated three times every 3 days. Two days after the last bathing fish were sampled to study. Our results showed that Chloramine-T bathing caused the decrease of the lipid peroxidation as well as ALT and AST activity and significant decrease of LDH activity (by 339%, p = 0.017) compared to controls. Chloramine-T markedly affects on lactate and pyruvate metabolism and resulted to decrease of LDH activity. Correlative analysis revealed that the lipid peroxidation level is correlated with ALT and AST activity in the muscle tissue of unhandled control group. In the muscle tissue of trout disinfected by Chloramine-T, LDH activity is correlated positively with ALT and AST activity. Thus, the skeletal muscles of fish play an important role in the processing of lactate through the gluconeogenic and glycogenic pathways including a greater potential for biosynthesis. Our studies indicated that Chloramine-T in dose of 9 mg per L could at least partly attenuate oxidative stress and can be used for prophylactic disinfecting treatment of rainbow trout. Oxidative stress and biochemical alterations could be effectively used as potential biomarkers of Chloramine-T toxicity to the fish in the warning signal for pharmaceutical exposure to aquatic organisms. However, more detailed studies on using of these specific biomarkers to monitor the disinfectant treatment in aquaculture are needed.

AB  - Aquaculture feeds have changed dramatically from being largely based on fishmeal (FM) towards increased use of plant protein sources, which could impact the fish's immune response. In order to characterize immunomodulatory properties of novel functional ingredients, this study used four diets, one based on FM, a challenging diet with 40% soybean meal (SBM), and two diets containing 40% SBM with 5% of Cyberlindnera jadinii yeast exposed to different down-stream processing conditions: heat-inactivated (ICJ) or autolysation (ACJ). The immunomodulatory effects of the diets were analyzed in the spleen of Atlantic salmon after 37 days of feeding, using a transcriptomic evaluation by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and the detection of specific immunological markers at the protein level through indirect Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (indirect ELISA). The results showed that SBM (compared to FM) induced a down-regulation of pathways related to ion binding and transport, along with an increase at the protein level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interferon gamma (IFNγ). On the other hand, while ICJ (compared to FM-group) maintain the inflammatory response associated with SBM, with higher levels of TNFα and IFNγ, and with an upregulation of creatine kinase activity and phosphagen metabolic process, the inclusion of ACJ was able to modulate the response of Atlantic salmon compared to fish fed the SBM-diet by the activation of biological pathways related to endocytosis, Pattern recognition receptor (PPRs)-signal transduction and transporter activity. In addition, ACJ was also able to control the pro-inflammatory profile of SBM, increasing Interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels and decreasing TNFα production, triggering an immune response similar to that of fish fed an FM-based diet. Finally, we suggest that the spleen is a good candidate to characterize the immunomodulatory effects of functional ingredients in Atlantic salmon. Moreover, the inclusion of ACJ in fish diets, with the ability to control inflammatory processes, could be considered in the formulation of sustainable salmon feed.

AB  - Due to their convenience, magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction kits are commonly used in shrimp genotyping and pathogen screening applications. However, in advanced breeding programs requiring the testing of many thousands of shrimp, their cost can be prohibitive. Various permutations of different Proteinase K digestion, tissue lysis and bead washing buffers as well as magnetic bead types were thus evaluated to devise a high-throughput shrimp DNA extraction (SDE) protocol capable of recovering high-purity DNA using a KingFisher™ Flex Magnetic Particle processor. When genotyped using a MassARRAY® platform (Agena Bioscience) requiring 60-61 genome regions to be co-amplified in a single multiplexed PCR, DNA extracted from shrimp muscle tissue using either the SDE protocol or a commercial kit generated comparable single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) call data. The SDE protocol also extracted high-purity DNA from salmon fin clips. It thus offers potential to markedly reduce the costs of large-scale genotyping in shrimp and salmon breeding programs.

AB  - The coast of British Columbia (BC) is host to runs of salmon that have been the economic, social, and cultural basis of Northwest Coast Native societies for millennia. Wild salmon hatch in streams and spend varying amounts of time there before migrating to the ocean. After spending up to several years in the ocean, these fish return to their natal streams to spawn once, then die. These spawning cycles facilitated productive Native fisheries over the centuries and, since the 1870s, industrial fisheries for global markets. Today, industrial salmon aquaculture sites can be found almost everywhere in the protected waters near shore, along the migration routes of what were once flourishing populations of Pacific salmon. Fish farms compound the destructive effects of more than a century of logging, overfishing, and urbanization on the wild salmon fisheries. The most direct and striking impacts of fish farms—ones that are directly observed by many local Native people—are the spread of fish diseases and waste materials into the surrounding habitat. Sea lice infestations of wild stocks are on the rise: these parasites and other disease organisms concentrate in the densely stocked net pens and appear to spread easily to passing wild salmon.1 Although a few fish farms are stocked with chinook salmon, a species that is native to the region, most farm sites contain Atlantic salmon. The reality of salmon escapes from net pens and the fact that Atlantic salmon originating from fish farms have been shown to spawn successfully in BC’s rivers have raised grave concerns about the ecological consequences of the invasion of local streams by this exotic species of salmon.2 Furthermore, the effects of the sewage emanating from fish farms are often noted by Native people using traditional clam digging and fishing spots.3

AB  - Candidatus Branchiomonas cysticola is the primary etiological agent of epitheliocystis and the most prevalent bacterium associated with gill disease (GD) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Norway. Partial sequencing of seven of the bacterium's partial housekeeping (HK) genes (aceE, dnaK, lepA, gltA, rplB, rpoC, and typA) revealed few genetic differences, irrespective of geographic origin, reservoirs, and fish populations. Candidatus Branchiomonas cysticola sequenced from gill samples of wild and farmed salmon in Norway and United Kingdom likely represents a single clonal complex (CC). Highly divergent genotypes were, however, identified from gill samples of rainbow trout. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (real-time RT-PCR) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) showed putative host-specific properties of the bacterial genotypes isolated from salmon and rainbow trout. Sequencing of the 16S and 23S rRNA ribosomal subunits from gills of these two hosts and from other fish species testing positive for Ca. B. cysticola revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These results support the existence of host-associated bacteria and suggest a strong selection towards host-specific variants of Branchiomonas. A novel host-specific bacterial species from gill samples of rainbow trout, named Candidatus Branchiomonas mykissicola, has therefore been proposed.

AB  - Climate change potentially threatens the sustainable production of highly valued cold-water fish species in flow-through systems, such as salmonids. By analysing the relationship of water temperature to hydrological characteristics, air temperature, solar exposure, and precipitation, this study predicted temperature dynamics of five temperate cold-water aquaculture facilities under four projected climate change scenarios. Air temperature was found to be directly associated with facility site water temperature, and based on rational assumptions, two of the five facilities were predicted to face critical warming by mid-century. Extreme precipitation events induced acute short-term increases in water temperature of up to 5 °C. Significantly lower warming, roughly equal to the projected climate change-induced increase, was seen with artificial shading lowering temperature by 1 °C. Complementary niche modelling revealed that 37-77 % of current cold-water facilities will likely incur suboptimal climate conditions by the end of the century. Shading of raceways, more efficient water use, and disease management are proposed as key actions to preserve cold-water aquaculture.

AB  - Because of intrinsic differences in their genetic architectures, wild populations invaded by domesticated individuals could experience population-specific consequences following introgression by genetic material of domesticated origin. Expression levels of 16 000 transcripts were quantified by microarrays in liver tissue from farm, wild, and farm-wild backcross (i.e. F1 farm-wild hybrid × wild; total n = 50) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) raised under common environmental conditions. The wild populations and farm strain originated from three North American rivers in eastern Canada (Stewiacke, Tusket, and Saint John rivers, respectively). Analysis of variance revealed 177 transcripts with different expression levels among the five strains compared. Five times more of these transcripts were differentiated between farmed parents and Tusket backcrosses (n = 53) than between Stewiacke backcrosses and their farmed parents (n = 11). Altered biological processes in backcrosses also differed between populations both in number and in the type of processes impacted (metabolism vs immunity). Over-dominant gene expression regulation in backcrosses varied considerably between populations (23% in Stewiacke vs 44% in Tusket). Hence, the consequences of introgression of farm genetic material on gene expression depended on population-specific genetic architectures. These results support the need to evaluate impacts of farm-wild genetic interactions at the population scale.

AB  - Scotland is currently one of the major aquaculture producers of Atlantic salmon. However, alongside its rapid growth over the last two decades, advocacy and conservation groups have initiated petitions, campaigns, and legal challenges, resulting in a perception that Scottish fin-fish farming is having a crises of social acceptance. A qualitative, grounded, case study approach was taken to explore this issue in-depth, using the theoretical framework of social license to operate. The Isle of Lewis and Harris and the county of Argyll and Bute were chosen due to their shared maritime cultures, the prominence of fin-fish aquaculture, and cultural and socio-economic differences between them. Interviews with community members and stakeholders were thematically analysed and showed that perceptions of fin-fish farming are complex. Community identity, as well as industry identity are shown to play an important role in perceptions of the industry. This has impacts upon SLO for the fin-fish farming industry, and the actions that the industry takes to integrate with local communities. Further, this work adds to the expanding evidence base within SLO literature, that context is key, and should be a significant consideration in an industry's corporate social strategy.

A stochastic simulation model was developed and used to examine the consequences of eight alternative strategies for setting commercial catch limits. The merit of each strategy was judged by three criteria: probability of satisfying escapement objectives, probability of simultaneously satisfying escapement and subsistence harvest objectives and the probability of also reaching commercial harvest goals. The results indicate that without improved preseason forecasts, subsistence and commercial catch objectives cannot be consistently achieved in the upper Yukon River unles...

AB  - The only carotenoid detected in newly fertilized eggs of wild Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, from western Scotland was astaxanthin at a concentration [μg carotenoid g−1 wet wt of eggs, mean ±S.D. (number of parental females)] of 6.2±1.2(7) in 1982, 6.4±1.8(20) in 1983, and 7.6 ± 13(6) in 1984. In eggs of farmed Atlantic salmon the only carotenoid detected was canthaxanthin at concentrations which varied significantly between farms depending on the level of synthetic canthaxanthin in the broodstock diet. Thus on two farms using feed with 50 μgg−1, the levels were 11.8 ± 3.4(7) and 12.3 ± 2.9(6), while on two farms using 75μgg−1 the levels were 18.7 ± 5.0(9) and 21.2 ± 2.7(21). The levels in eggs of one-seawinter fish (grilse) did not differ from those of two-seawinter fish reared on the same farm and diet. During development from newly fertilized egg to fry at the end of yolk-sac absorption, the quantity of carotenoid present per individual decreased, presumably as a result of metabolism. Despite large differences in quantity present, the quantity so metabolized was fairly constant at 2–4 μg carotenoid g−1 original egg weight for eggs from two-seawinter farmed and wild salmon, except that in eggs from farmed grilse it was 7 μg g−1. In fry from wild eggs, 99.14% of the remaining carotenoid was present in the integument (skin and fins) as astaxanthin, astaxanthin monoester and astaxanthin diester. In fry from farmed salmon eggs, 47 ± 8% of the carotenoid present was found in the unused yolk oil droplets and in the liver, and 37 ± 6% was found in the integument as canthaxanthin and an unidentified metabolite of canthaxanthin. These findings explain visible colour differences between fry from wild parents and fry from canthaxanthin-fed farmed parents, particularly in the fins, liver and residual oil droplets. The canthaxanthin metabolite was also found, together with canthaxanthin, in the skin of farmed adults fed canthaxanthin. Preliminary tests showed it to be unchanged by saponification but reduced by sodium borohydride. For eggs from the three farms incubated under the same conditions in the same season, percentage mortality both to the eyed stage and between hatching and first feeding varied significantly between farms, but percentage mortality between the eyed stage and hatching did not do so. Results combined from two seasons for eggs from three farms and one wild source showed that egg mortality between fertilization and the eyed stage was not significantly different between wild and farmed salmon, but mortality between the eyed stage and hatching, and between hatching and first feeding, were both significantly higher in farmed salmon than in wild salmon. Such differences could not be explained simply by the large differences in egg carotenoid content, but were almost certainly due to factors such as broodstock nutrition, broodstock management, and stripping and fertilization procedures.

AB  - <jats:p>The Gulf of Maine (GoM) is one of the fastest-warming parts of the world’s oceans. Some species’ distributional shifts have already been documented, especially for commercially-important species. Less is known about species that are not currently exploited but may become so in the future. As a case study into these issues, we focus on lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) because of the recognized and timely need to understand wild lumpfish population dynamics to support sustainable fisheries and aquaculture developments. Using occurrence data from five different fisheries-dependent and -independent surveys, we examined lumpfish distribution over time in the GoM. We found that lumpfish presence was more likely in spring and correlated with deeper waters but not bottom temperature. Since 1980, lumpfish presence has increased over time, moved farther offshore, and shifted northward. Our work provides preliminary information for resource managers to ensure that lumpfish are harvested sustainably for use in emergent lumpfish aquaculture facilities. An understanding of lumpfish occurrence patterns may enable lumpfish aquaculturists to utilize the most local populations, thus maintaining the local genetic integrity of fish slated for release into net pen salmonid farms.</jats:p>

AB  - The sea louse is considered an important ectoparasite that affects farmed salmonids around the world. Sea lice control relies heavily on pharmacological treatments in several salmon-producing countries, including Chile. Among options for drug administration, immersion treatments represent the majority of antiparasitic control strategies used in Chile. As a topical procedure, immersion treatments do not induce a long lasting effect; therefore, re-infestation from neighbouring farms may undermine their efficacy. Synchronization of treatments has been proposed as a strategy to improve immersion treatment performance, but it has not been evaluated so far. Using a repeated-measures linear mixed-effect model, we evaluated the impact of treatment synchronization of neighbouring farms (within 10km seaway distance) on the adult lice mean abundance from weeks 2 to 8 post-treatment on rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon farms in Chile, while controlling for external and internal sources of lice before the treatments, and also for environmental and fish-related variables. Results indicate that treatment synchronization was significantly associated with lower adult lice levels from weeks 5 to 7 after treatment. This relationship appeared to be linear, suggesting that higher levels of synchronization may result in lower adult sea lice levels during these weeks. These findings suggest that synchronization can improve the performance of immersion delousing treatments by keeping sea lice levels low for a longer period of time. Our results may be applicable to other regions of the world where immersion treatments are widely used.

AB  - Salmonid aquaculture is the oldest form of fish rearing in North America, with recorded efforts at artificial propagation of salmon and trout dating back to the 1850s in Canada and the 1870s in California. For many years, the production level and dollar value of salmonid aquaculture were greater than all other forms of aquaculture. Currently, salmonid aquaculture in North America is second in production behind catfish and third in dollar value behind catfish and ornamental and bait fishes. The salmonids include the five species of Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon, trouts, and chars.

AB  - <jats:p>Particulate calcium oxide (CaO) has been successfully used for the control of sea urchin and starfish populations. Recent studies have proven its efficacy in killing planktonic copepods, making it a promising and cheap option for salmon louse control in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming industry. Additionally, preliminary laboratory tests demonstrated that exposure to 0.2 g/L–0.6 g/L of fine CaO particles induced significant mortality of salmon louse (<jats:italic>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</jats:italic>) in the planktonic stages. The present study investigated the effects of water treatment with fine CaO particles [0.2 g/L or 127.4 g/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>; 0.1 mm–0.3 mm], conducted twice a week for three consecutive weeks at 5°C and 12°C on Atlantic salmon post-smolt in a flow-through system. The study compared mortality rates and histopathology of skin, eyes, gills, and intestines between treated and untreated control salmon. The results indicated that CaO exposure did not induce fish mortality or histopathological damages in the skin, eyes, or intestines. Although there were no significant effects of CaO exposure on gill inflammation or hyperplasia, the exposure did increase the occurrence of gill vascular injuries and necrosis in small portions of the tissue (&amp;lt; 10% of the respiratory gill tissue in most of the samples) by 60% and 35%, respectively. The effect was not modulated by temperature or time. The results indicate that the CaO treatment protocol used in this study is not lethal to Atlantic salmon and is safe for most analyzed tissues. Nonetheless, the induction of vascular damage and necrosis in the gill, albeit in small tissue portions, emphasizes the need for further research. It is crucial to develop a protocol that avoids such lesions, ensuring the secure application of CaO as an antiparasitic treatment in salmon aquaculture.</jats:p>

AB  - The negative effects of parasitism on host population dynamics may be mediated by plastic compensatory life-history changes in hosts. Theory predicts that hosts should shift their life-history towards early reproduction in response to virulent pathogens to maximize reproduction before death. However, for sublethal infections that affect growth, hosts whose fecundity is correlated with body size are predicted to shift towards delayed reproduction associated with larger body size and higher fecundity. This has been observed in Atlantic salmon and parasitic sea lice, via mark-recapture studies that recover mature fish from paired groups of control and parasiticide-treated smolts. We investigated whether such louse-induced changes to age at maturity can offset some of the negative effect of mortality on population growth rate in salmon using a structured population matrix model. Model results show that delayed maturity can partially compensate for reduced survival. However, this only occurs when marine survival is moderate to poor and growth conditions at sea are good. Also, the impact of delayed maturity on population growth when parameterizing the model with empirical data is negligible compared with effects of direct mortality. Our model thus suggests that management that works on minimizing the effect of sea lice from fish farms on wild salmon should focus mainly on correctly quantifying the effect of parasite-induced mortality during the smolt stage if the goal is to maximize population growth rate.

S. Mahmood (alaashm91@gmail.com)&#x0D; Abstract: &#x0D; Objective: To assess the effect of methotrexate and omega-3 combination on cytogenetic changes of bone marrow and activities of some enzymatic antioxidants.&#x0D; Methods: Fifty-six mature male Wistar rats were divided into two experimental groups and a control group. The first experimental group was sub-divided into three sub-groups depending on the concentration of methotrexate (MTX): X1 (0.05 mg/kg MTX), X2 (0.125 mg/kg MTX) and X3 (0.250 mg/kg MTX), which were given intraperitoneally on a weekly basis for eight weeks. The second experimental group (MTX and omega-3 group) was also sub-divided into three sub-groups (Y1, Y2 and Y3), which were injected intraperitoneally with 0.05, 0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg MTX, respectively, weekly for eight weeks accompanied by the oral administration of 300 mg/kg omega-3. The rats of the control group were given distilled water. The enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in the sera of rats. In addition, the mitotic index (MI) and chromosomal aberrations of bone marrow were also studied.&#x0D; Results: MTX resulted in a significant decrease in the activities of CAT, SOD and GR compared to the controls. It also increased the MI and chromosomal aberrations of rat bone marrows. On the other hand, omega-3 significantly increased the activities of the investigated enzymatic antioxidants and reduced the MI and chromosomal aberrations in treated mice when given in combination with MTX.&#x0D; Conclusions: MTX has a genotoxic effect on the bone marrow by increasing the MI and all types of chromosomal aberrations and decreasing the enzymatic activity of CAT, SOD and GR. The addition of omega-3 can lead to a protective effect by reducing the toxic and mutagenic effects of MTX.&#x0D; Keywords: Methotrexate, Omega-3, Antioxidant, Wistar rat, Chromosomal aberration, Mitotic index&#x0D; 1. Introduction&#x0D; Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid antagonist because of their chemical similarity [1]. Vezmar et al. [2] showed that MTX affects the synthesis of nucleic acids deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) by interfering with the biosynthesis of thymine and purines. It also directly affects the rapidly dividing and intact cells, especially those in the mucous membranes of the mouth, intestine and bone marrow [3].&#x0D; Omega-3 is a type of unsaturated fats, which are classified as essential fatty acids that cannot be manufactured by the body and should be taken with food [4]. Sources of omega-3 include fish oils, such as salmon, sardines and tuna, as well as soybeans, walnuts, raisins and linseed, almonds and olive oils [5]. Omega-3 is used in the prevention of a number of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, asthma, atherosclerosis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases [6]. A large amount of evidence indicates that omega-3 fatty acids have significant health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties besides their effect on blood cholesterol levels [7]. Antioxidants retard the oxidation process by different mechanisms such as the removal of free radicals [8].&#x0D; Enzymatic antioxidants include catalase (CAT), which is the first line of defense in the cell that removes hydrogen peroxide formed during biological processes by converting it into an aldehyde, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). There are three major families of SOD enzyme : manganese SOD (Mn-SOD) in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, iron SOD (Fe-SOD) in prokaryote cells and copper/zinc SOD (Cu-Zn SOD) in the cytoplasm of eukaryote cells [9]. Therefore, changes in the metal co-factors (manganese, iron, copper and zinc) can alter the effectiveness of SOD and may lead to diseases as a result of oxidative stress [10]. Glutathione reductase (GR) is also an enzymatic antioxidant that converts the oxidized glutathione to the reduced glutathione in the presence of NADPH, which is oxidized to NADP [11]. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of MTX and omega-3 on the cytogenetic changes of bone marrow as well as the activities of CAT, SOD and GR enzymatic antioxidants in male rats.&#x0D; 2. Method&#x0D; 2.1. Laboratory animals and experimental design&#x0D; Fifty-six mature male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), aged 10–12 weeks old and weighing 250–300 gm, were used in the present study. The rats were kept in separate cages, with natural 13- hour light and 11-hour dark periods in a contamination-free environment with a controlled temperature (28.0 ± 1.0°C). In addition, rats were maintained on a standard diet and tap water ad libitum.&#x0D; The rats were randomly allocated to two experimental groups and a control group. The first experimental group (MTX group) included 24 rats injected intraperitoneally with different MTX dilutions with distilled water [12]. It was sub-divided into three sub-groups (eight rats per sub-group) according to MTX concentration as follows: X1 (0.05 mg/kg MTX), X2 (0.125mg/kg MTX) and X3 (0.25 mg/kg MTX). All rats were given a single dose of the specified MTX concentration weekly for eight weeks. The second experimental group (MTX and omega-3 group) included 24 rats allocated to three sub-groups (Y1, Y2 and Y3), which were injected intraperitoneally with 0.05, 0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg MTX, respectively, weekly for eight weeks accompanied by the oral administration of 300 mg/kg omega-3. The control group included eight rats that were intraperitoneally injected with distilled water and given a single dose of distilled water orally weekly for eight weeks.&#x0D; 2.2. Blood collection and processing&#x0D; After the end of the dosing period, 5 ml of blood were withdrawn from the heart (by cardiac puncture) using a 5 cc disposable syringe. The collected blood was immediately poured into a clean sterile screw-capped tube (plain tube) and left for coagulation in a water bath at 37°C for 15 minutes. After coagulation of blood, the plain tube was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm. Then the samples were stored at -20°C for subsequent analysis.&#x0D; 2.3. Measurement of the activity of antioxidant enzymes&#x0D; The antioxidant activities of CAT, SOD and GR were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits purchased from Kamiya Biomedical Company (Seattle, WA, US), according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#x0D; 2.4. Cytogenetic study of bone marrow&#x0D; Rats were killed by cervical dislocation, and their hip bones were cleaned from surrounding muscles and then dissected by cutting both ends of the bone. Five milliliters of physiological buffered saline were injected inside the bone to withdraw bone marrow into a test tube. Tubes were centrifuged at 2000 rpm/10 minutes. The supernatant was then removed, and 10 ml of KCL solution (0.075 M) were added to the sediment. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 30 minutes, with shaking from time to time. The tubes were then centrifuged at 2000rpm/10 minutes to remove the supernatant. However, 5 ml of a freshly prepared fixative solution (methanol: glacial acetic acid 1:3) were added gradually in the form of droplets into the inner wall of the tube with constant mixing. After that, the tubes were placed at 4 °C for half an hour to fix the cells. This process was repeated for three times, and the cells were then suspended in 2 ml of the fixative solution. The tubes were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was then removed while the cells were re-suspe ded in 1-2 ml of cold fixative solution. After shaking the tubes, 4–5 drops were then taken from each tube onto a clean slide from a height of about three feet to provide an opportunity for the cells and nuclei to spread well.&#x0D; The slides were stained with acridine orange solution (0.01%) for 4–5 minutes, incubated in Sorensen’s buffer (0.06M, pH 6.5) for a minute. and then examined using a fluorescence microscope Olympus BX 51 America at a wavelength of 450–500 nm [13, 14].&#x0D; A total of 1000 cells were examined, and both dividing and non-dividing cells were calculated [13]. Mitotic index (MI) was calculated according to the following formula [13]: MI= No. of dividing cells / 1000 × 100&#x0D; 2.5. Analysis of chromosomal aberrations of bone marrow cells&#x0D; A total of 1000 dividing cells were examined on the stained slides under a fluorescence microscope at a wavelength of 45–500 nm. The examined cells were at the first metaphase of the mitotic division, where chromosomal aberrations are clear and can be easily seen [13].&#x0D; 2.6. Statistical analysis&#x0D; Data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS®) software, version 9.1 (Cary, NC, USA) [15]. Effects were expressed as mean ± standard error (SE) and statistically compared using a completely randomized design analysis of variance and least significant differences. Differences at P values &lt;5 were considered statistically significant.&#x0D; 3. Results&#x0D; 3.1. Effects of MTX and MTX-omega-3 combination on antioxidant enzymatic activities&#x0D; Table (1) shows significantly lower SOD activities among rats treated with MTX or MTX-omega-3 compared to controls. Moreover, sera of rats receiving relatively high doses of MTX (sub-groups X2 and X3) showed the lowest enzymatic activities of 4.29 ± 0.01 IU and 3.93 ± 0.11 IU, respectively. On the other hand, CAT activity differed significantly between treated and control rats as well as among treated rats themselves, In this respect, the controls showed the highest activity of 39.38 ±0.02 IU, while those receiving the highest MTX concentration, either alone or in combination with omega-3 (sub-groups X3 and Y3), showed the lowest activities of 30.97 ± 0.03 IU and 32.12± 0.06 IU, respectively.&#x0D; Regarding GR activity, control rats showed a higher activity of 53.09± 0.05 IU compared to treated ones; however, the differences in GR activities in rats given low doses of MTX, either alone or in combination with omega-3 (sub-groups X1 and Y1), were not statistically significant. On the other hand, rats in sub-groups X3 and Y3 showed the lowest GR activities of 34.59 ± 0.63 IU and 37.15 ±0.01, respectively, with statistically significant differences from other sub-groups.&#x0D; 3.2. Effects of MTX and MTX-omega-3 combination on mitotic index of bone marrow cells&#x0D; Figure (1) shows a significant decrease in the MI in all treated groups compared to control. In addition, there was a reverse association between MTX concentration and MI, where rats treated with the highest dose of MTX (sub-group X3) showed a significant decrease in MI compared to all other treated rat sub-groups. In addition, rats in sub-groups treated with MTX and omega-3 (sub-groups Y1, Y2 and Y3) showed a significant increase in MI compared to their counterpart rats receiving MTX only.&#x0D; Table 1.

AB  - Aquaculture is playing an important role in the development of fisheries in Vietnam, a role which has accelerated since 2000. Sustainability in aquaculture is receiving increasing attention, and this issue is not only the concern of government, but also stakeholders participating in the value chain. Therefore, this study aims to identify sustainability issues of farmed seafood by assessing the main sustainability issues raising concern. The Global Value Chain framework described by Gereffi et al. (2005) is applied for this study to explore the business relationships in supply chain and the perceptions of sustainability concerned by the value chain actors. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used to collect data. An assessment of four species cultured on the Mekong Delta, the countries farmed seafood ‘hub’, found a clear distinction between species cultured with a local domestic market orientation (Giant Freshwater Prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii; and Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus) and the two key export commodities Striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) and Penaeid shrimp (Penaeus monodon & Litopenaeus vannamei). These orientations were based on a range of factors including the development of effective seed supplies and the cultural value of marketing in the live format. This study, conducted in ten provinces in the Mekong Delta from 2009 to 2013 had a focus on understanding the export-orientated commodities, striped catfish and shrimp through collection of baseline information on the value chain of farmed seafood, focusing on the farming sector, the actors and institutions involved and beneficiaries. Sustainability issues and perceptions of experts (top-down) and primary stakeholders (bottom-up) opinions were assessed through participatory workshops.

AB  - In the larval stage of the parasitic copepod Lepeophtheirus salmonis, the free-living copepodid must locate and settle on a salmonid host. Chemosensory mechanisms play a role in determining whether a potential host is suitable for attachment, yet the full suite of chemical cues and resulting behavioral mechanisms used are unknown. After maturing, pre-adult female and adult male salmon lice aggregate upon salmonid hosts for reproduction. Copepodid salmon lice have been observed preferentially infesting hosts that harbor conspecific adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that salmon lice copepodids perceive and respond to cues from pre-adult female, adult-male, and/or gravid female salmon lice. Behavioral bioassays were conducted in vitro with copepodids exposed to water conditioned with 3 stages of conspecific lice (pre-adult female, adult male, or gravid female), and seawater conditioned with Atlantic salmon Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758. Experiments demonstrated that copepodids exposed to water conditioned with the salmon host, pre-adult female, or adult male salmon lice significantly altered their behavior, whereas salmon lice exposed to water conditioned with gravid females did not. These results are potentially valuable in the development of novel methods for mitigation of L. salmonis in the salmon aquaculture industry.

AB  - An extensive literature has documented the existence of suites of correlated behavioural traits (called behavioural syndromes) in a range of vertebrate species, as well as in some invertebrates. The existence and persistence of such behavioural syndromes is of both fundamental and applied interest and the main aim of the work described in this thesis was to examine sources of individual variation in risk-taking and aggression, as well as the circumstances under which those behaviours could be uncoupled. The study used two species of freshwater fish that have become something of a model to study behaviour: the three spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). In chapter 1 I give a background on the current research on individual variability in behaviour, behavioural syndromes and coping strategies, with special reference to fish; as well as considering the implications of behavioural syndromes for evolutionary biology and aquaculture. Chapter 2 describes a long-term experiment on boldness, aggression and the relationship between them in sticklebacks that grew at different rates under two different competitive regimes. In one treatment (the low interaction condition) food was dispersed, while in the other (the high interaction condition), food was clumped. Fish were fed to excess in both treatments. Analysis of the relationship between risk-taking and some morphological variables showed that, in general, shy fish were heavier and longer than both bold and behaviourally intermediate fish, independently of their body condition. Fish from the low interaction condition were more aggressive than those from the high interaction feeding regime. Boldness and aggression were positively associated only in the fast growing fish from the high interaction competitive regime. Limited evidence suggests that individual personalities may influence reproductive success and other fitness-related traits in complex and context-specific ways. In the study described in Chapter 3, I used an indirect approach to relate fitness to personalities in sticklebacks. Specifically, I related hatching date of fry (used as an indirect measure of parental fitness) to their personalities (boldness and aggression). Individuals that hatched early were bolder than late hatched fish, whereas most of the shy individuals were found among the late bred fish. There were no detectable differences in aggression between early and late hatched fish, but there was a relationship between boldness and aggression independent of hatching date. In chapters 4 and 5, I describe studies of rainbow trout from two lines selected for breeding for low (LR) or high (HR) post-stress plasma cortisol response that have become something of a model system for studies of coping strategies in fish. In addition to striking differences in cortisol responsiveness, LR and HR fish show patterns of brain biochemistry, risk-taking and aggression that are typical of so-called proactive and reactive animals respectively. The results reported in chapter 5 strengthen this interpretation, by comparing behavioural flexibility and response to novelty in 3rd generation LR and HR rainbow trout. After being trained individually to find food in one arm of a T-maze, HR fish were able to found food strikingly faster than LR trout when the resource was moved to a different position. In contrast, LR fish were much less distracted by the presence of an unfamiliar object. Previous studies have shown that proactive animals develop and follow routines more strictly than do reactive animals, while the latter are more aware of changes in their environment. My results therefore give further support to the characterisation of LR and HR rainbow trout as showing proactive and reactive coping strategies. In chapter 4 however, I complicate this interpretation by showing that the relationship between boldness and aggression is flexible. Following transport from the UK to Norway, HR and LR fish switched behavioural profiles. In contrast to the results of previous studies, HR fi h fed sooner in a novel environment and became dominant over LR fish in pairwise aggressive interactions. One year after transport, HR fish still fed sooner than LR fish, but no difference in social dominance was found. Among offspring of transported fish, no differences in feeding rates were observed, but as in pre-transported 3rd generation fish, HR fish lost fights for social dominance against size matched LR opponents. Transported fish and their offspring retained their distinctive physiological profile throughout the study, with HR fish showing consistently higher post-stress cortisol levels at all sampling points. Therefore the striking difference in cortisol responsiveness in these two strains of trout is on its own not sufficient to maintain distinct behavioural phenotypes. The work described in this thesis therefore extends current understanding of individual variability in behaviour and of behavioural syndromes by identifying circumstances under which risk-taking and aggression are uncoupled in two species of freshwater fish. It also suggests some potential consequences for fitness. In chapter 6 these results are discussed on the light of current research on animal personalities, behavioural syndromes, coping strategies and their implications for evolutionary biology. Particular reference is made to the existing literature on fish and the implications of those findings for aquaculture are also discussed.

AB  - This study represents the Wrst determination of lipids and fatty acids in Wsh scales. Scales collected from groups of Atlantic salmon reared on Wsh farms and in experimental tanks were analyzed by chromatography. The complete suite of fatty acids normally found in marine organisms was detected in the scales, with the following fatty acids dominating: 16:0, 18:0, 18:1n9, 20:5n3, 22:6n3 and 24:1n9. Scales contained relatively high levels of furan fatty acids, and the level of cholesterol (2.5-5 mg/g tissue) was much higher than the levels found in the edible parts of marine Wshes (0.2-1 mg/g tissue). The fatty acid proWle of scales was distinct between groups of salmon originating from diVerent commercial strains reared on the same farm, between salmon groups originating from the same strains but reared at diVerent farms, and between groups of fed and unfed salmon in experimental tanks. Together, these data indicate that the fatty acid composition of Wsh scales is dependent upon both environmental and genetic factors. The fatty acid composition of Wsh scales may be used in stock/population identiWcation, for example identiWcation of escaped Atlantic salmon to farm of origin.

AB  - Salmonid are farmed far offshore in a submersible cage in China, and air supplementation in the swim bladder is an important issue while the fish are confined in the submersed cage. The objective of this study is to test the effects of different types of air supplementation on the growth, energy budget, and fatty acid composition of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, confined underwater. The fish were divided into four groups with four replicates (63.84 ± 2.03 g, 13 fish per tank): The control group fish (Ctrl) were cultured in a glass fiber tank with airstone; The mesh group (ME) used a net in a tank to keep the experimental fish from the water surface, and an airstone above the net; The airstone group (AM) added an airstone under the net; And the airdome group (DM) added an airdome under the net. At the end of a 35-day trial, the final mean weight (70.00 ± 1.63 g), percent weight gain (7.09 ± 0.96%) and survival rate (76.92 ± 0.00%) of the fish in ME group were significantly lower than those in Ctrl group (91.54 ± 5.19 g, 43.49 ± 10.35% and 100.00 ± 0.00%, respectively). The final mean weight of AM group was significantly lower than that of Ctrl group, whereas there were no significant differences in other growth indexes between control group, DM and AM group. The proportion of feeding energy allocated to growth in ME group was the lowest, the proportion in AM was significantly higher than ME group and lower than Ctrl group, and there was no significant difference between those in DM and Ctrl groups. The muscle saturated fatty acid level in Ctrl group was significantly lower than those in other groups. In conclusion, the growth of rainbow trout confined underwater for 35 days will slow down due to lower proportion of feeding energy allocated to growth and higher proportion to respiration. The addition of an airdome or airstone can partially compensate for the growth of the fish confined underwater long time. Rainbow trout confined underwater can partially compensate for the loss of buoyancy through increasing the muscle saturated fatty acid content.

AB  - Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are common natural phenomena along the Chilean coast. In southern fjords, the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella is the most studied species because of its production of saxitoxin and analogues responsible for Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). Despite its deleterious effects on the local shellfish and finfish aquaculture industry, little is known about the dinoflagellate’s ecology in this complex fjord ecosystem. In the present study in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: i) the role of A. catenella resting cysts in bloom dynamics; ii) physiological response of vegetative cells to `pCO_2``/pH` variations; and iii) the cytolytic potency of its exudate compounds against fish gill cells. Cyst experiments newly revealed a short cyst dormancy period (minimum 69 days) and highly variable reproductive compatibility determined by the geographical origin of isolates and their population genetic distances. Excystment processes were strongly driven by environmental factors, such as salinity and irradiance, which therefore provide important clues to understand regional bloom events. These results suggest a more important role for resting cysts in bloom dynamics in the Chilean fjords than previously thought. Exposure of A. catenella to variations in `pCO_2``/pH` resulted in optimum growth and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) uptake at near equilibrium pH (8.0). Reduced cell size and enhanced chain formation occurred at high `pH``/low` `pCO2`. These results point to morphological and physiological adaptations by A. catenella against wide natural `pCO_2``/pH` fluctuations, and suggests a negligible impact of future ocean acidification scenarios on Alexandrium bloom dynamics in southern fjords. Our results on the potency of cytolytic toxins produced by A. catenella assessed on a rainbow trout gill cell line assay showed that pure PST fractions (C1&C2, STX, GTX 1&4) had insignificant lytic activity compared to the synergistic interaction between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The novel application of non-invasive microelectrode ion flux measurement (MIFE) techniques on fish gill cells revealed that A. catenella metabolites from lysed cultures affected gill cell `K^+` channels by generating a strong efflux from the cell membrane, but again this was not caused by PST fractions. Cellular potassium efflux is known to generate cell shrinkage and cell death, and might be a key factor to explain fish gill damage from A. catenella. This study newly elucidated key aspects of the ecophysiology and the fish-killing mechanisms of A. catenella in the Chilean fjords. These results have important implications for the way the salmon industry should manage and mitigate future algal bloom events.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Background Diverse microbial communities colonizing the intestine of fish contribute to their growth, digestion, nutrition, and immune function. We hypothesized that the gut microbiome of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this microbiome can improve profitability of aquaculture. To test this hypothesis, four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family. Five different extraction methods were used to obtain DNA from feces for 16S rRNA microbiome profiling. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood, Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters. Results Differences in DNA extraction methods result in significant variation in identification of bacteria that compose the gut microbiome. Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. The gut microbiome was different from that of the environment (feed and water). However, feed and gut shared a large portion of their microbiome suggesting significant contribution of the feed in shaping the gut microbiota. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. An indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia and Peptostreptococcus) as indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as slow-growing indicator taxa. Conclusion DNA extraction methodology should be taken into account for accurate profiling of the gut microbiome. Although the microbiome was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</jats:p>

AB  - Knowledge of the distribution and biology of the ragfish, Icosteus aenigmaticus, an aberrant deepwater perciform of the North Pacific Ocean, has increased slowly since the first description of the species in the 1880’s which was based on specimens retrieved from a fish monger’s table in San Francisco, Calif. As a historically rare, and subjectively unattractive appearing noncommercial species, ichthyologists have only studied ragfish from specimens caught and donated by fishermen or by the general public. Since 1958, I have accumulated catch records of >825 ragfish. Specimens were primarily from commercial fishermen and research personnel trawling for bottom and demersal species on the continental shelves of the eastern North Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and the western Pacific Ocean, as well as from gillnet fisheries for Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus spp., in the north central Pacific Ocean. Available records came from four separate sources: 1) historical data based primarily on published and unpublished literature (1876–1990), 2) ragfish delivered fresh to Humboldt State University or records available from the California Department of Fish and Game of ragfish caught in northern California and southern Oregon bottom trawl fisheries (1950–99), 3) incidental catches of ragfish observed and recorded by scientific observers of the commercial fisheries of the eastern Pacific Ocean and catches in National Marine Fisheries Service trawl surveys studying these fisheries from 1976 to 1999, and 4) Japanese government research on nearshore fisheries of the northwestern Pacific Ocean (1950–99). Limited data on individual ragfish allowed mainly qualitative analysis, although some quantitative analysis could be made with ragfish data from northern California and southern Oregon. This paper includes a history of taxonomic and common names of the ragfish, types of fishing gear and other techniques recovering ragfish, a chronology of range extensions into the North Pacific and Bering Sea, reproductive biology of ragfish caught by trawl fisheries off northern California and southern Oregon, and topics dealing with early, juvenile, and adult life history, including age and growth, food habits, and ecology. Recommendations for future study are proposed, especially on the life history of juvenile ragfish (5–30 cm FL) which remains enigmatic.

AB  - Four major genotypes of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), which have been isolated from many marine and freshwater fish species, are known to differ in virulence. While fast and low-cost genotyping systems based on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed for typing of VHSV virulence, there is a need for supplementing the knowledge. In particular, 2 field isolates from viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) outbreaks in sea-reared rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in Sweden, SE-SVA-14 and SE-SVA-1033 (both genotype Ib), have yielded contradictory reactions. In the present study, upon cloning by limited dilution, both isolates appeared to be heterogeneous in terms of reactivity with nucleo (N)-protein-specific MAbs as well their gene sequences. Infection trials in rainbow trout further revealed differences in the virulence of these virus clones derived from the same primary isolate. Based on a comparative analysis of the entire genome of the clones tested, we suggest that the differences in virulence are tentatively linked to substitutions of amino acids (aa) in the N-protein region covered by aa 43-46 and aa position 168, or a combination of the two. The fact that such minor naturally occurring genetic differences affect the virulence implies that even low-virulent VHSV isolates in the marine environment should be considered as a potential threat for the trout farming industry. The described MAbs can represent useful tools for initial risk assessment of disease outbreaks in farmed trout by marine VHSV isolates.

AB  - Mixed herds of pink salmon including the fish of both artificial and natural origin are exploited by fishery in many areas of Sakhalin Island. To separate the fish of different origin, large-scale tagging of the juveniles otoliths is conducted at salmon hatcheries since 2008. The hatcheries contribution to pink salmon catches in certain areas of East Sakhalin (from the Langeri River to Cape Crillon) is assessed for 2011–2017 on the base of previously published and new data on occurrence of the fish with marked otoliths. The specimens were sampled from commercial catches of 5–13 fixed nets and from research catches in 5–9 rivers throughout entire spawning season. In total, 40,992 otoliths of pink salmon were collected. The otoliths were prepared for microstructure analysis using standard methods of processing. All marked otoliths had the tags of hatcheries located on the eastern coast of Sakhalin. The fish of artificial origin were caught in all examined sites between Cape Soymonov and Cape Crillon every year, but in some years their distribution was wider, up to the northern limit of the investigated area (Langeri River). The fish of artificial origin migrated to all rivers within this area. The total annual landing of the pink salmon marked at artificial hatcheries in the East Sakhalin waters was estimated as 300–10600 t, by years. The rest of the fish of artificial origin (0.4–2.3 . 106 ind.) entered to the rivers and mostly reached the spawning grounds. Long-term dynamics of landing was compared for the pink salmon of artificial and natural origin and their independence was concluded. Distribution of pink salmon originated from certain artificial hatcheries by sites of catch was rather constant that allowed to extrapolate the results for marked fish to all released pink salmon. The highest contribution of pink salmon of artificial origin was noted for catches in the Aniva Bay (23.9 %, on average), it was lower for catches at the southeastern coast of Sakhalin (13.2 %), and more lower for catches in the Patience Bay (7.6 %). Total number of pink adults of artificial origin caught on a particular stretch of coast did not depend directly on the number of pink juveniles released from a local hatchery, but was determined mainly by number of fish migrated there from other hatcheries. The landing of pink salmon originated from artificial hatcheries directly in the rivers where these hatcheries were located and at their mouths was < 10 % of the total catch of pink salmon of artificial origin. Schemes of quantitative distribution of pink salmon with marked otoliths in the waters of East Sakhalin are presented.

AB  - Water quality, measured on a fisheries ecosystem scale of 1 (good/salmonid) to 6 (bad/fish absent), of forty-two lowland streams in two Northern Ireland river catchments was inversely correlated with the stocking rate of grazing animals. A decrease in water quality of one class was associated with an increase in the combined grazing/stocking rate of cattle and sheep of 0.6 dairy cow equivalents/ha. This dairy cow equivalent stocking rate was significantly correlated with maximum BOD and total amm.N concentrations and minimum dissolved-oxygen levels. The worst pollution events, with BOD concentrations in excess of 100 mg/1, occurred at the end of May and were caused by discharges of silage effluent. Smaller BOD peaks, which occurred in late winter and early spring, were related to the land spreading of animal slurries. It was concluded that poultry and pig farms were not having a major impact on water quality.
