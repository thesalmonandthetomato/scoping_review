AB  -  OHQ vol. 112, no. 2 Where the Crooked River Rises: A High Desert Home by Ellen Waterston Oregon State University Press, Corvallis, 2010. Photographs, 144 pages. $18.95 paper. From Sarah Winnemucca to Julia Gillis, Dorothy Lawson McCall to C.E.S. Wood, Ada Hastings Hedges to Jarold Ramsey, and William Kittredge to Eileen McVicker, Oregon’s high desert has inspired nearly 150 years of literary revelation. With this fourth book, Ellen Waterston adds to those revelations. Nine published and seven unpublished works predominate—non-fictionessaysthatcanmix autobiography, biography, history, anecdote, journalism, and folklore. Three pieces derive fromWaterston’s acclaimed 2003 memoir Then There Was No Mountain: A Parallel Odyssey of a Mother and Daughter through Addiction (Rowman Littlefield). Two poems and at least nine photographers enhance the work with twenty-six black-and-white photographs — four by Waterston herself. Where the Crooked River Rises seems grounded in two personal epochs. New England native, 1968 Harvard B.A., University of Madagascar M.A.,stringer for Time,Waterston was suitably married to Samuel J. Bartow. As readers of Then ThereWas No Mountain know, the newlyweds first ranched in Montana, then came to Oregon in 1973 and bought a remote spread on the Crooked River. For seventeen years, the couple ranched. While raising three children, Waterston learned to love the desert, but Bartow became a drug addict. Their paradise became hell.In 1985,Ellen Bartow and her three young children evacuated “our desert ranch to town in the family station wagon” (Then There Was No Mountain, xiii). Single mother and divorced, Bartow adopted her maiden name again. As Ellen Waterston,she found refuge in booming Bend, where she became a successful strategic planner and communications specialist. As journalist, writer,and poet,she founded a literary retreat, published her 2003 memoir, and won the 2005 national WILLA award in poetry for I Am Madagascar (2004). Since 2005, she has been the impresario of The Nature of Words, an ambitious and successful literary organization. Among her recent honors is a second WILLA award for Between Desert Seasons (2009,Wordcraft of Oregon). Many of these essays tacitly contrast those two personal epochs. In “PauMau,” she celebrates ranch women at their Christmas party, then in “What One Thing,” she describes a Bend dinner party of new peers — non-profit schmoozers and shakers. In“That’s Deep,”she describes“Jack,”a nonagerian rancher and his “settin in the saddle” theories (p. 48). “Main Thing,” in contrast, sketches the urban advocacy of Don Kerr, founder of the High Desert Museum, and documents his theory: we must shift from“user to steward or all will be lost”(p. 63).In“TwoAlices,”Waterston describes homesteaderAlice Day Pratt (1872–1963) and rancher Alice DeLore. Sketching those single women living alone,Waterston explores the differences between her own flight and those who refused to marry or leave. Her poems continue these tacit contrasts: in 2000, she published “Trapping Coyotes,”a folkloristic monologue of Van Houston, a character documented during her ranching past in Then ThereWas No Mountain; in 2005,Waterston was commissioned to write and perform “Take a River,” a pop history of Bend, for the city centennial. Finally, she contrasts her “homes.” In “The Old Hackleman Place . . .” she “takes a sentimental journey . . . to that beloved, dusty ranch where I once lived . . . as a newlywed, carried three children, raised a family,and watched a husband become invisible to himself . . .”(p.29–30).In“Looking Up to Low,”she describes her new urban home “on the banks of the Deschutes River as it flows throughdowntownBend”andfifty-somepages later mentions her failing second marriage to David Bong (p. 67). Some readers may find Waterston unreliable : in “Cows Kill Salmon,” “Last Log,” and  Book Notes “Morally Certain,” the author avoids stating how and why capitalism degrades and dest oys ecosystems,begins and ends industries,attracts and subjugates populations.Other readers may want fewer inaccuracies, more credits, and larger, sharper photographs. Nevertheless, Waterston delivers: perched on an empty barn wall, coiled riata in hand, black Stetson on her head, she stares out — rider ready for whatever revelation comes next. Sometime she lives in hard country, sometimes she lives in boom town. Winnemucca to McVicker, her desert ancestors understand...

AB  - Selection experiments and game theory models have revealed that the changes in agonistic behavior following selection for rapid growth rate of fish depend on the access of food. If food is spatially restricted and in excess of demand, the intensity of agonistic behaviors will decrease. This prediction was tested in an experiment on wild and sea-ranched brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) fry originating from a common stock. Agonistic behavior, activity, and specific growth rate were studied in tanks (56 × 56 cm) at high (159.4 fry/m2) and low (9.6 fry/m2) stocking densities given either a large or small food ration (3.0% and 1.5%, respectively, food per total body weight and day). Observations were done during 4 days in each trial. Generally, fry of sea-ranched origin had a higher growth rate. No differences in activity were found. Intensity of agonistic behavior was higher among wild groups. There was a tendency for interaction between density and strain, e.g., wild fish were relatively more aggressive at higher densities. Food ration had no effect on level of agonistic behavior. These results indicate that the selection for rapid growth in hatcheries may indirectly select for reduced aggressiveness. Genetic integrity and diversity of wild populations may be threatened when interbreeding occurs between wild and hatchery fish. Aggr. Behav. 28:145–153, 2002. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Carlin tagging data for 1980–1991 were used to examine the influence of smolt size and feeding conditions on the post-smolt survival of ranched River Neva salmon, (Salmo salar L.), in the the Gulf of Finland, which is the native feeding area of the stock, and in the Bothnian Sea, where the stock has been introduced. Because of better feeding conditions, the survival rates were higher and less variable in the Gulf of Finland than in the Bothnian Sea. In the Bothnian Sea, the annual variability in survival decreased and the mean value increased with increasing smolt size from the smallest (14–16 cm) to the largest (28–30 cm) size classes. The survival was positively correlated with growth rates, food resources and sea-surface temperatures. This suggests that in the Bothnian Sea the annual variability in survival is mainly because variable marine conditions affect growth rates, and, thus, the vulnerability of the post-smolts to size-dependent predation. In the Gulf of Finland, the survival advantage of large initial size and rapid growth was counteracted by size-selective post-smolt mortality from fishing. The increase in the survival rate with increasing smolt size levelled off at 22 cm, and the correlations between survival, growth and the indices of feeding conditions were mostly insignificant. For large smolts, some negative correlations were recorded, suggesting that the relative significance of mortality from fishing may even exceed that of size-dependent natural mortality. The implications of the results for management are discussed.

AB  - Straying of ranched salmon into rivers in Iceland has given cause for concern because of ecological, genetic, and disease effects on wild stocks. More than 96% of returning Icelandic ranched salmon are harvested at ranching stations. Over 80% of the strays into salmon rivers occurs on the west coast in the area where most of the ranching stations have been located. In that area the ranched component in rivers ranged from 20% (average 4.4%) of the population, depending on proximity to the ranching sites. Combined strays from river enhancement and from the west coast rivers into the ranching stations averaged 2.5% (97.5% recovered in rivers), which corresponds to 1.0% of the total harvest at ranching stations. Strays of enhanced populations were at least three times more numerous in ranching stations than strays of wild salmon. Eighty-nine to ninety-seven percent of the ranched salmon returning to ranching stations were recaptured in the station of release. Strayers from other ranching stations in the catches of individual ranching stations comprised 2-13% of the catch with the extent of straying being more related to harvest methods and the location of the ranching station than to homing accuracy. Biological and social concerns regarding the harvesting methods at ranching stations, increased illegal fishing effort as a result of ranching and a put-and-take fishery for ranched salmon, which has been developing in Iceland since the late 1980s are discussed. The management implications of these practices are considered as well as possible solutions to the problems associated with ranching.

AB  - The degree of accuracy in portrayals of Navajo culture at Salmon Ruins Heritage Park and Rock Art Ranch was assessed by comparing the Navajo structures assembled at each site to archaeological, ethnographic and historical data for traditional Navajo construction practices. Comparison and analysis revealed different degrees of accuracy in the portrayal of features with cultural and functional importance. Authentic practices were presented in a historical framework to permit the temporal characterization of each site. The aggregate of the temporal data from features at both sites was consistent with Navajo sites of the early twentieth century. The results of this study suggest a bias in contemporary portrayals of Navajo culture favoring the most extensively documented, and the more recent, aspects of Navajo culture.

AB  - In the breeding system of Pacific salmon, females compete for oviposition territories, and males compete to fertilize eggs. The natural selection in females and sexual selection in males likely has been responsible for their elaborate breeding morphologies and the dimorphism between the sexes. We quantified direct-selection intensities during breeding on mature coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), measured for seven phenotypic characters, including three secondary sexual characters. Wild and sea-ranched hatchery coho were used to enhance the range of phenotypes over which selection could be examined. The fish were allowed to breed in experimental arenas where we could quantify components of breeding success as well as estimate overall breeding success. We found that without competition, natural selection acts only on female body size for increased egg production; there is no detectable selection on males for the phenotypic distribution we used. Under competition, the opportunity for selection increased sixfold among females. Natural selection favored female body size and caudal-peduncle (tail) depth. Increased body size meant increased egg production and access to nesting territories. The caudal peduncle, used in burst swimming and nest digging, influenced both successful egg deposition and nest survival. Increasing density increased competition among females, though it did not significantly intensify natural selection on their characters. In males, competition increased the opportunity for selection 52-fold, which was nine times greater than for females. Sexual selection favored male body size and hooked snout length, both characters directly influencing male access to spawning opportunities. Selection on male body size was also affected significantly by breeding density. The ability of large males to control access to spawning females decreased at higher densities reflecting an increase in the operational sex ratio. Further, the relative success of small males, which could sneak access to spawning females, appeared to increase as that of intermediate-sized males decreased. Such disruptive selection may be responsible for the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics in salmon.

AB  - The divergence of hatchery fish in traits important for reproductive success has raised concerns about their ability to rehabilitate wild populations, and the threat that their inevitable straying poses to biological diversity through introgression. We therefore undertook a study of the breeding competition and success of sea-ranched hatchery fish placed in direct competition with wild fish. Experiments using wild and hatchery coho salmo (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were conducted within a controlled stream channel, allowing selective manipulation of breeding competition and density. Hatchery fish, particularly males, were competitively inferior to wild fish, being less aggressive and more submissive. As a consequence, hatchery males were denied access to ovipositing females; they partook in fewer spawnings, held more distal positions in spawning hierarchies, and attained only an estimated 62% of the breeding success of wild males. By contrast, competition did not appear to inhibit hatchery females as overtly as males. Hatchery and wild females exhibited similar levels of aggressive behavior, however hatchery females did suffer greater delays in the onset of breeding, failed to spawn larger proportions of their eggs, and lost more eggs to nest destruction by other females. They averaged an estimated 82% of the breeding success of wild females. There was thus a sex bias in the breeding disadvantage of hatchery fish, with males suffering more than females. Furthermore, the breeding disadvantage was density dependent with the relative success of hatchery to wild fish declining with increasing density. These results imply that hatchery fish have restricted abilities to rehabilitate wild populations, and may pose ecological and genetic threats to the conservation of wild populations.

AB  - Ocean-ranching programs in Asia and North America are supplementing, or have replaced, the natural production of some salmonid populations feeding and maturing in the North Pacific Ocean. These activities, coupled with favorable survival conditions, have raised many stocks to historical or near historical highs during the last decade and a half. Studies of ocean forage production and the response of nekton populations to changes in levels of forage demonstrate multi-year and interdecadal variability attributed to large-scale atmospheric cycles. The period since the most recent regime shift favored salmon production in Alaska waters, but not off Washington and Oregon. We present modeled estimates of the forage demand placed on coastal and oceanic feeding areas by wild and ocean-ranched pink salmon originating from Prince William Sound, Alaska, as a case history. Annual food consumption for these stocks rose from less than 100,000 mt prior to 1976 to more than 300,000 mt after 1988, when hatchery production began dominating adult returns. Food demand was distributed nearly equally between survivors and nonsurvivors, and most of the food consumption occurred in the oceanic rather than coastal environments. Because, for all species, adults that return at smaller than average size are less fecund and produce smaller eggs and fry, increased competition for food resulting in smaller body size could influence the survival of progeny, with serious consequences for both wild and hatchery populations. Studies suggest that competition can result from increased salmon production, diminished forage production, and decreases in the size of ocean feeding domains.

AB  - CHARLES WILKINSON Celilo Falls At theCenter of Western History INTHE LATE 1980s, Ibeganwritinga book on thelandsandwatersof theAmerican West. Itwas basically a history, a recounting of the actions and ideas that have driven the relationships between theUnited States govern ment and the landscape of the West and the people who were already there. One thing is sure. From Lewis and Clark through roughly the 1960s, a single core conviction trumped all else: American technology could rework the natural and cultural world in any conceivable way ? and fast ? to achieve the demands of settlement and development. To tell that story, Iwanted to identify the events that best represented America's epic advance on the lands,waters, and people of the West. I settled on several. The all-out rush on the gold and silver fields. The damming of Hetch Hetchy Valley in the Sierra Nevada, sacred to theMiwok, glorious to JohnMuir. The clearcutting of theNorthwest's forests. The ranch cattle industry's takeover of the public range lands. The inundation of Glen Can yon on the Colorado River and its ancient villages and petroglyphs in the Southwest. The destruction of Celilo Falls. Celilo had a particular hold onme. Iwas teaching law at theUniversity of Oregon at the time and, although the Falls was not part ofmy youth, people fromYakama, Nez Perce, Umatilla, andWarm Springs mentioned itoften. I was taken, too, by the sadness and anger of non-Indians who had witnessed, and been inspired by, those age-old fisheries atwork. Ken Kesey had some of his factswrong, but he acknowledged inOne Flew Over theCuckoo's Nest the iconic place of Celilo Falls in the history of the Pacific Northwest. Inmy mind, Celilo came to stand as an emblem of how westerners have always This essaywas presented as the opening address at the "Celilo Stories" conference inThe Dalles, Oregon, in March 2007. 532 OHQ vol. 108, no. 4 ? 2007 Oregon Historical Society Indian fishermenwork at Celilo Falls shortlybeforethe inundation.

Rather, they would leappart-way up the falls and swimfrantically up thecurrentuntil theyreached theslower river-waterabove. wanted progress ? that is,quick money ? regardless of theworth ofwhat was already there and would be lost. I tried to think through the best way to explain Celilo. As I did, I kept reflecting on how Indian people talked about, and felt,their tribal histories. The detail. The precision. The care. The respect. The determination to get it right. One day Iwas over at Warm Springs, having a talkwith Delbert Frank, who turned thediscussion tofishing in theColumbia River Gorge. His fam ilyhad always fished there, and he'd long been a leader on the tribe's fish committee. After awhile, I found myself saying that Iwas starting a book and that Iwanted Celilo to be a central part of it. Wilkinson, Celilo Falls 533 "Would you be willing to sitdown and takeme through what it was like on theColumbia before white people?" I asked. Delbert thought about it. "Yes. That sounds good." "Could we spend awhole day on it?" "Sure." Then Delbert added: "How about ifwe talk down by the water?" I said that would definitely be fine. A fewweeks later, Ipicked him up early, and we headed out. Delbert said he'd been thinkingmaybe the best place to talkwould be Sherars Bridge on theDeschutes. That way, he explained, while we wouldn't be down on the Columbia, we would have a flowing river.And the tribal fisherywas active, sowe'd be able to see dipnet fishermen working their scaffolds right across the river from us. I'll never forget that bright, early summer, high desert day, June 30,1988. Delbert was so patient, so vivid. He took me back to the time before Lewis and Clark. And I realize now that day was the beginning of the enterprise that givesme the purest joy of anything inmy professional life: listening to, and putting down inwriting, the stories of Indian people. Delbert's family fished mostly at Big Eddy, in Long Narrows about six miles below Celilo Falls. His grandfather, Yahtin, was born in 1840 and his gre t-grandfather, Wunn-o-ah-chi, in about 1805. So Delbert received information from a person...

AB  - A computerised approach called CODES has been developed, which provides a way for analysing and managing 1D SDS PAGE protein information in terms of digitisation, quantification, normalisation, storage, retrieval and visualisation with an application domain focused on the skin mucus of ranched Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts. This approach used a scientific grade image capture instrument AlphaImager HP, preprocessed digitised protein gel images in a standard approach, quantified protein gel images using gel image analysis software, normalised gel protein images, established a databank to store proteomics information and investigated skin mucus proteins by analysing changes in proteins during the smoltification period of Atlantic salmon. A new prototype system called NeVPAS web application, to implement the CODES approach, has been developed to support biologists in order to investigate changes in Atlantic salmon smolts skin mucus proteins and to determine the optimal time to release smolts to the sea. The application of the CODES approach and NeVPAS is not limited to Atlantic salmon but is also suitable for other species and can be extended to 2D SDS PAGE gel images.

AB  - Anadromous salmonids have been particularly successful at establishing wild populations in southern Patagonia, in contrast to their limited success elsewhere outside their native ranges. The most recent such discovery is a spawning population of Chinook salmon in the Santa Cruz River, which flows into the Atlantic Ocean from Argentina. We used mitochondrial DNA analysis to discriminate between alternative potential sources of this population and were able to discard in situ introductions of fish imported directly from California in the early twentieth century. Our results showed that the fish most likely came from Puget Sound, Washington, imported into southern Chile for salmon-ranching experiments in the 1980s. This finding provides concrete evidence of colonization of Atlantic rivers from Pacific locations. The southern Pacific and Atlantic oceans provide a favorable marine environment for the success of invading salmon. In particular, the waters associated with fjords, southern channels, and the inshore portion of the Patagonian shelf provide a rather bounded, continuous waterway for exotic anadromous salmonids, rich in diverse forage species.

AB  - Paired releases of Carlin tagged fish were carried out in the river Kokemaenjoki, Bothnian Sea, in 1991-1993, to compare the survival and migration of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) smolts released at two different sites, off the estuary and at Nakkila, 55 km upstream. The eight different smolt groups, divided between the two sites, ranged in mean weight from 27 g (1 yr) to 260 g (2 yr). The size of the smolt groups were planned according to previous experience of the expected rate of recapture to allow the detection of a deviation of 20-25% from the initial 50:50 (coast:river) stocking ratio at a 5% significance level and 90% power, which requires 279 and 180 recaptures for each group, respectively. A 25% deviation corresponds to 40% mortality/55 km of river migration, which is somewhat less than reported in the literature. In all, 20 000 smolts were released.Tag recoveries were collected until the end of 1996 (total number 2544). For all six groups of 2 yr smolts (120-260 g), the numbers recaptured were as high or higher than expected, exceeding the limit of 279 recaptures. For the two groups of 1 yr smolts (27 and 34 g), the rates of recapture were lower than expected (only 20 and 14 recaptures, respectively), and therefore the planned statistical analysis was not possible for these groups.For all paired releases of 2 yr fish, the results were similar irrespective of the release site. First, the distribution of recoveries over the years was homogenous for coastal and river releases at the 5% significance level (G-test for independence), suggesting that it is appropriate to add up all recoveries over time. Secondly, the total amounts of recoveries did not differ significantly from the original stocking ratios (coast:river) at the 5% significance level (G-test for goodness of fit), indicating that the release site did not affect the survival of 2 yr smolts.Due to extremely intensive sea fishery, 99.5% of adult recoveries with a known location (total 1695) were reported from the sea area. Only eight fish (0.5%) were captured in the Kokemaenjoki, and none in other rivers. It was thus not possible to test properly for differences in homing and straying between the two release sites. The migration pattern in the sea area was not affected by the release site.To improve the survival rates and the cost effectiveness of sea ranching, salmon smolts are released directly into the sea in the vicinity of several Baltic rivers. The present study challenges the economic justification of such releases in the River Kokemaenjoki. For large 2 yr smolts, comparable survival rates in this river system may be attained in upstream releases as well.

AB  - Increasing concern has been expressed about the genetic effects of cultured salmonid fishes on natural populations. Avoidance of extreme negative outcomes was one reason for the establishment of a genetic management policy for the State of Alaska. However, domestication within the hatchery may still cause divergence from the wild donor population. This divergence could potentially lead to adverse impacts on wild stocks through straying and introgression. This study examines potential domestication in two Alaskan chinook salmon stocks. The Little Port Walter (LPW) Hatchery Chickamin River stock resulted from a small collection of wild broodstock in 1976. The LPW Unuk stock was founded with a larger number of individuals in 1976 and has had subsequent infusion of wild gametes. These lines have been maintained at LPW through ocean ranching of tagged smolts. Comparisons are made between the hatchery lines, progeny of wild chinook collected from the Chickamin and Unuk Rivers, and hybrids between the hatchery and wild groups. Mature ocean-ranched female chinook salmon returning to the facility were periodically graded for ripeness and spawned. Body size and meristic measurements were collected from these mature spawners. Maturation timing, fecundity, and individual egg size of these fourth generation hatchery fish are compared with that of offspring of wild fish from the same donor stock. Stock of origin is confirmed for all spawners and offspring using microsatellite DNA analysis.

AB  -. The effectiveness of three different growth media KDM-2, S-KDM and S-KDM-C for primary isolation of Renibacterium salmoninarum was examined over a 14-week incubation period. Kidney samples were taken from Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., broodfish returning to a sea ranch after 2 years at sea. Homogenized samples were inoculated onto two selective media, S-KDM supplemented with lamb serum and S-KDM-C supplemented with activated charcoal. The third medium was the non-selective serum supplemented KDM-2. Renibacterium salmoninarum was isolated from 112 samples on one or more of the media used. Of all positive samples, 91% were positive on S-KDM, 60% on S-KDM-C and 35% on KDM-2. These results demonstrate that selectivity significantly enhances the isolation capacity of the medium and that supplementing with serum is significantly more effective than supplementing with charcoal.

AB  - Secondary males, either subdominant adults or, more usually, parr which mature in freshwater, are known to successfully fertilise Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) ova. This study has estimated the reproductive success of such secondary males in redds formed by pairs of wild and sea-ranched adults. Eight wild and 11 ranched redds were sampled from the Burrishoole system, western Ireland, in two consecutive years. Representative samples of fertilised ova were screened at three minisatellite loci to reconstruct the genotypes of putative anadromous parents and to estimate the proportion of eggs fertilised by secondary males. Multiple paternal genotypes were detected in 18 of the 19 samples, and of the 1484 progeny examined, 593 could not have been derived from the primary adult male genotype. The level of secondary male contribution detected among wild redds from Burrishoole (mean 28.9%) was similar to that found in previous published studies. The level among ranched redds was significantly higher (mean 48.2%) (...

AB  - Discriminant function analysis was used to distinguish morphologically between samples of parr, smolts and adult Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from several hatchery and river systems in Ireland. The effect of habitat shift was investigated in Atlantic salmon parr. Parr grown from the eyed-egg stage with a non-sibling group in a hatchery environment, came to resemble the mean body shape of their host hatchery Atlantic salmon stock more closely than that of a full sibling group grown at their natal hatchery. Wild Atlantic salmon smolts differed in shape from hatchery-reared smolts. This difference was less pronounced, but still statistically significant when wild adults were compared with hatchery-reared adults captured in the coastal drift-net fishery after a year spent at sea. Rearing conditions had a significant impact on the production and growth of fish body shape. This in turn may have affected adaptability and survivorship of ranched Atlantic salmon in the marine environment.

AB  - We have studied the developmental stability (measured as fluctuating asymmetry of five meristic characters) of three populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (rivers Imsa, Lone and Ogna, western Norway). All three populations were both sampled in the wild, and hatched and reared in a common environment in a hatchery (with water from the river Imsa) from fertilization until smoltification. Both the Imsa and Lone hatchery populations have been sea-ranched in the Imsa for 10 years, whereas the Ogna populations is novel to the hatchery environment. Individual biochemical heterozygosity was scored at 50 loci, of which 11 were polymorphic. There was no correlation between biochemical heterozygosity and fluctuating asymmetry at the individual level, neither when tested within groups nor when tested between groups. There were no differences in fluctuating asymmetry between wild and hatchery Imsa and Lone fish, indicating that the hatchery environment did not disrupt early developmental homeostatic processes. However, the Ogna hatchery fish had significantly elevated levels of fluctuating asymmetry compared to the wild Ogna fish, indicating that the hatchery environment was hostile. The Ogna hatchery fish also had significantly higher fluctuating asymmetry than the Imsa hatchery and the Lone hatchery fish. Maladaptation to the hatchery environment is the most likely explanation for the increased asymmetry in river Ogna fish.

AB  - The lifetime success and performance characteristics of communally reared offspring of wild native Burrishoole (native), ranched native (ranched) and non-native (non-native) Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from the adjacent Owenmore River were compared. Non-native 0+ year parr showed a substantial downstream migration, which was not shown by native and ranched parr. This appears to have been an active migration rather than competitive displacement and may reflect an adaptation to environmental or physiographic conditions within the Owenmore River catchment where the main nursery habitat is downstream of the spawning area. There were no differences between native and ranched in smolt output or adult return. Both of these measures, however, were significantly lower for the non-native group. A greater proportion of the non-native Atlantic salmon was taken in the coastal drift nets compared to the return to the Burrishoole system, probably as a result of the greater size of the non-native fish. The overall lifetime success of the non-native group, from fertilized egg to returning adult, was some 35% of native and ranched. The ranched group showed a significantly greater male parr maturity, a greater proportion of 1+ year smolts, and differences in sex ratio and timing of freshwater entry of returning adults compared to native, which may have fitness implications under specific conditions.

AB  - Offspring of wild and sea-ranched (domesticated) sea trout (Salmo trutta) originating from the same river, were reared under identical hatchery conditions from the time of fertilization. At one year of age individual fish were exposed to two standardized stressors; transfer to a novel environment, with or without a simultaneous predator exposure. Blood plasma concentrations of glucose and cortisol were analyzed along with brain levels of dopamine (DA), 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC, a major DA metabolite), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 HIAA, a major 5-HT metabolite). Transfer to a novel environment, alone as well as in combination with predator exposure, resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of glucose and cortisol. Moreover, exposure to these stressors resulted in elevated brain levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA, as well as elevated brain 5-HIAA/5-HT and DOPAC/DA ratios. Wild trout displayed significantly higher post stress plasma glucose levels than domesticated fish. Similarly, following stress, brain 5-HIAA/5-HT and DOPAC/DA ratios were significantly higher in wild than in domesticated fish. These differences were not caused by differences in brain levels of 5-HIAA and DOPAC, but instead by differences in brain 5-HT and DA concentrations. These results suggest that domestication results in attenuated stress responses in trout, and that alterations in brain monoamine neurotransmission are part of this effect.

AB  - r-In a 2.5 year (1978-1980) study of the lotic warmwater fish communities of the Platte River Basin, Colorado, 25 native and 9 non-native species were collected. Three natives (Nocomis biguttatus, Couesius plumbeus, and Notropis heterolepis) have been extirpated. Salmo clarki stomias was not collected, nor were the provisional natives, Stizostedion vitreum and Carpiodes cyprinus. Eleven native species were rare in the basin. The rarity of each was strongly correlated with their limited historic distributions, rather special habitat requirements, and intolerance of environmental stresses. Six native species were historically more common and widespread, but habitat deterioration associated with European settlement has caused their decline. The remaining native species (8) were common and widely distributed. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was the only common non-native fish. Lack of suitable habitat is believed responsible for the rarity of other non-native species. The Platte River arises in the Rocky Mountains of central and northern Colorado; the river system is comprised of two major basins: the North and South Platte. The North Platte River System in Colorado is limited to its headwaters area, a broad intermountain basin (3,706 km2). In its warmwater reaches, coalescing streams are small (<15 m wide and <1 m deep) but have a mixture of flow patterns. The relative isolation and high elevation (2,250 m) of the basin have restricted human activities primarily to ranching. In contrast, the South Platte River basin is 59,927 km2 and has a greater diversity of stream morphologies. Upon emerging from the mountains, the streams are in transition from montane to plains streams. Stream dimensions vary, but streams exhibit a commonality of heterogeneous flow patterns and substrate types. As the system progresses eastward and anastomoses, streams evolve from ones characterized by variable gradients and substrate types but stable, sinuous thalwegs to broad, shallow, sand- bottomed rivers. Except for the South Platte River, the eastern portion of the basin is drained only by intermittent streams. Peak discharge in the basins normally occurs from late spring to mid summer (May-July). Mean discharge of the South Platte River varies greatly, but decade means have remained fairly constant since 1900 (Williams, 1978) (Fig. 1). The South Platte River System has been significantly altered by human activities. As the streams flow eastward, they are deleteriously affected by industrial, municipal, and agricultural effluents. Irrigation, flood control, and municipal water supply reservoirs control the pulse of water through the streams. Transmountain diversions and ground-water pumping supplement natural discharge. The North Platte System in Colorado remains comparatively unmodified. Because this research was funded by the Colorado Division of Wildlife, political rather than ecosystem boundaries defined the limits of the study

AB  - Tributaries in the South Fork Boise River (below Anderson Ranch Reservoir) and Squaw Creek (Payette River) were surveyed to collect information on the distribution of redband trout Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri and bull trout Salvelinus confluentus. In the South Fork Boise River drainage, 10 sites were surveyed across 4 tributaries. Redband trout were present at all sites, except Little Rattlesnake Creek, where no salmonids were sampled. Multiple-pass depletion estimates were made at three sites, and redband density ranged from 5.7 – 12.6 fish/100 m 2 . Size distribution of redband trout in Cottonwood Creek and Rattlesnake Creek suggests these are resident redband trout populations. Redband trout collected in Trail Creek was mainly age-0 fry, suggesting use by a fluvial spawning population. Bull trout were captured in Rattlesnake Creek and Cottonwood Creek, but were in very low densities. As part of a cooperative effort with the US Forest Service to collect information on redband trout and bull trout distribution, 24 stream sites across 8 streams were sampled in the in the upper Squaw Creek drainage of the Payette River. Redband trout were found in each stream except for Gabe’s Creek, where only bull trout were found (at the lower site). No salmonids were found at seven sites. Depletion estimates were made at 16 sites, and redband trout density was highly variable (3.2 – 50.4 fish/100m 2 ). Of the 1,083 redband trout captured, 77% were over 100 mm in length. Based on size distributions, most of these streams appear to have resident populations of small redband trout, with bull trout in some locations. A total of 79 bull trout were caught across three streams: Gabe’s, Renwick, and Third Fork Squaw creeks. Third Fork Squaw Creek had the highest bull trout densities of the streams surveyed (15.1 fish/100m 2 ), while only one bull trout was collected in Renwick Creek. Densities of redband trout appear to be similar or higher than previous samples at the most comparable locations.

AB  - Two distinct stress coping strategies, proactive and reactive, have been stated in various animal studies, each associated with a set of behavioural and physiological characteristics. In a given challenging situation, proactive animals show more aggression, a higher general activity and a predominant sympathetic reaction. In contrast, the reactive copers respond more with immobility and avoidance, and a predominant parasympathetic/hypothalamic activation. This divergence in coping has also been indicated in salmonid fish. Interestingly, many of the differences reported between sea-ranched and wild fish resembles characteristics that differentiate proactive and reactive copers. In the present thesis it is shown that individuals with divergent stress coping styles are identifiable in several brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations. Further, the results show that the distribution of individuals displaying these distinct stress coping strategies differs between populations. This strongly indicates that these traits are heritable and that the variation in selection regime in the native rivers influences these traits. In addition, the results show that populations with hatchery origin are biased towards having higher frequencies of trout displaying a proactive style than populations having wild origin. Also, even though the frequency of early sexual maturation, known as a viable alternative life history in salmonids, differs between populations of brown trout, no link between stress coping strategy and early sexual maturation were found. However, this thesis show that maternal contribution, in the form of egg size, is of major importance whether the progeny will sexually mature early and that it also might be of importance for stress coping strategy. Further, correlations of traits commonly associated with stress coping strategies and behavioural syndromes across context and over time is investigated. The results show that individuals with a strong sympathetic reactivity are more prone to change their behaviour than others.

Here, we test the hypothesis that divergent stress coping styles are identifiable in a sea-ranched brown trout population. To that end, we used a series of tests on individual juvenile brown trout, with each test including a common key aspect of the two different coping styles. Using a clustering method (SAS: PROC FASTCLUS), two groups that clearly differed both in blood chemistry (noradrenalin and adrenalin levels) following confinement and in behavior during hypoxia were identified.

AB  - The restoration of a one-mile stretch of the lower Wooden Valley Creek on the cattle ranch owned by the McQueeny family in Napa County, California addressed denuded stream banks lacking native riparian vegetation and canopy cover that have resulted in salmonid habitat degradation and species decline (Marcus and CSPA, 2004). A primary concern of the McQueeny restoration demonstration project is the impact of high summertime stream temperatures on steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and the threat of continued bank incision in close proximity to the McQueeny home (Marcus and CSPA, 2004; Marcus, October 18, 2010; McQueeny, November 2, 2010 and November 20, 2010). Existing studies of the McQueeny property, Wooden Valley Creek, and larger Suisun Creek watershed restoration describe restoration baselines, restoration processes, and intended goals and outcomes (Circuit Rider Productions, 2007; Jackson, 2007; Purcell and Cover, 2007; Marcus and CSPA, 2004). Our research aims to fill a gap in the connection between the abundance of research, design, process, and outcome data (quantitative) and rancher/landowner implementation data (qualitative). Restoration literature in general calls for participatory, collaborative processes, and adaptive management (Beechie et. al, 2010; Downs et. al, 2002; Kondolf, 1998; Kondolf et. al, 1995; Palmer et. al, 2005; Wohl et. al, 2005). Nevertheless, we argue that this restoration project is an example of how restoration planning, and especially post-project monitoring, may not include specific indicators or means for evaluating how landowners/stakeholders facilitate or impact restoration success. We investigate not only re-vegetation interim achievements, but also how this landowner-involved restoration process is impacted by landowner decision-making and by largely undocumented adaptive maintenance activities independently carried out by the landowner. Evidence suggests that these factors are critical to the potential success or failure of the project in restoring riparian vegetation, improving bank stability, and ultimately enhancing stream conditions for steelhead trout (O.mykiss).

AB  - To examine the link between early experience and subsequent reproductive performance, we experimentally manipulated the early experience of Atlantic salmon (Sabno sola). Salmon of a common genetic background were reared as juveniles either naturally in the river or artificially in a hatchery (sea ranched), depriving them of river experience, and then allowed to grow to maturity naturally in the ocean. At maturity, the competitive and reproductive abilities of these fish were compared in four experiments quantifying reproductive success. Although levels of aggressive behavior were similar, the experience-deprived, searanched males were involved in more prolonged aggressive encounters and incurred greater wounding and mortality than wild males. Furthermore, sea-ranched males were less able to monopolize spawnings and as a result obtained 51% the reproductive success of wild males across the experiments. This reproductive inferiority varied directly with the male density and bias in the sex ratio, reflecting the intensity of male breeding competition. A lower intensity of female than male competition was likely responsible for the lack of differences in breeding performance between sea-ranched and wild females. Sea-ranched females, however, produced smaller eggs than wild females, apparently in response to their higher juvenile growth rate. Differences in migratory behavior were also apparent, as sea-ranched males and females ascended the River Imsa later than wild fish. Our results indicate that early experience has implications for subsequent adult reproductive performance, affecting the development of specialized skills and traits important not only for early life, but also later life.

AB  - This sea ranching experiment was performed under traditional hatchery conditions to test the null hypothesis that increasing the water current velocity prior to release does not aVect the recapture of the adults. During mid-winter 1991‐1992, 42% of 41 000 juvenile oVspring from four local river stocks were marked with Visible Implant (VI) tags. From mid-February to late April the 1+ pre-smolts were held at Sagen hatchery under two diVerent tank flow regimes in six 5-m diameter circular outdoor tanks, termed low and moderate exercise groups (LE and ME). The water flow velocities were 17‐23 cm s "1 close to the tank walls in the three ME tanks and 8‐12 cm s "1 in the LE tanks. The flow velocities decreased to a little less than 50% of the above readings towards the tank centres. On 6‐9 April, when tagging 500 fish from each tank with Carlin tags, the LE fish of two stocks were significantly larger than the ME fish but the diVerences were small in magnitude (Table I) and not diVerent for the other two stocks. Condition factor generally was not aVected by the flow regimes, except for one of the stocks (Table I). The variability in flow within circular tanks may be a reason for the small growth diVerences, and besides, the juveniles were free to move between the gradients.

AB  - La invasion del salmon Chinook en Patagonia es la de mayor escala en el mundo. Estos peces provienen de introducciones en Chile en experimentos de ranching o de escapes de cultivos en jaulas. Los salmones proveen de nutrientes y modifican el sedimento de los rios y sus juveniles compiten con y consumen otros peces. Una encuesta a usuarios sugiere que la presencia del salmon en el rio De Las Vueltas (Santa Cruz) atrajo nuevos perfiles de usuarios y a pesar de que la mayoria manifesto cambios negativos en el ambiente, al mismo tiempo se manifestaron interesados en la preservacion del salmon.

AB  - Experimental releases of Atlantic salmon smolts treated with emamectin benzoate (EB) against salmon lice have previously been used to estimate the significance of salmon lice on the survival of migrating smolts. In recent years, the salmon louse has developed reduced sensi- tivity to EB, which may influence the results of such release experiments. We therefore tested the use of 2 anti-lice drugs: EB was administered to salmon smolts in high doses by intra-peritoneal injection and the prophylactic substance EX (SubEX) was administered by bathing. A third, untreated control group was also established. Salmon were challenged with copepodids of 2 strains of salmon lice (1 EB-sensitive strain and 1 with reduced EB-sensitivity) in mixed-group experimental tanks. At 31 d post-challenge, the numbers of pre-adult lice on treated fish were around 20% compared with the control fish, with minor or no differences between the 2 treat- ments and lice strains. Both treatments therefore appeared to give the smolts a high degree of pro- tection against infestation of copepodids of salmon lice. However, significantly lower growth of the EB-treatment group indicates that bathing the fish in SubEX is less stressful for smolts than intra- peritoneal injection of EB.

AB  - The potential impact of sea lice infestation on outwardly migrating Atlantic salmon smolts has been investigated by treating populations of ranched salmon, prior to release, with a prophylactic sea lice treatment conferring protection from sea lice infestation, for up to 9 weeks. Established populations of ranched Atlantic salmon with well described rates of return were chosen to investigate the potential contribution of early infestation with the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis to mortality in Atlantic salmon. Against a backdrop of a declining trend in survival rates of Atlantic salmon many studies are attempting to elucidate potential causes for this decline. Results from this study over a period of 9 years point to infestation with the salmon louse ( L. salmonis ) as being a minor component of marine mortality in the stocks studied.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ex situ conservation comprises some of the oldest and best-known conservation methods and it has been applied for different fish stocks. This study describes attempts undertaken to preserve the long-migrating River Vistula (Poland) brown trout by a sea-ranching programme in the River Dalälven (Sweden). This focal strain was threatened in its native river and a major reason for selecting the River Dalälven was that its river mouth faces north as does that of the River Vistula. In the Swedish river, the Vistula trout in the 1970s and early 1980s returned early in the autumn and were generally large-sized (compared to the native strain of the River Dalälven). Over the study period (1978–2012), the size of returning adult fish declined, the return date becoming later in the year, and the number of spawners also declined. The reasons for these changes were probably caused by several interacting factors: (1) the most likely being high mortality of early returning fish which were held for longest in captivity before being used in the artificial spawning process; (2) the fact that the hatchery process was adapted to the Dalälven strain and not the Vistula one; (3) that the Vistula fish were marked by removing both pelvic fins (possible reducing subsequent survival); and (4) low genetic variation (as a result of few returning individuals). Thus, for several reasons, this ex situ conservation attempt for Vistula trout in Sweden is thought to have failed.</jats:p>

AB  - Summary  The difference in fat content and fatty acid composition in the muscle of one-and two-year-old ocean-ranched Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was studied and compared using spot samples. The fat content in the muscle of 1-year-old salmon was 4.8% of wet weight, and 5.0% in 2-year-old salmon. The effect was not statistically significant. The main constituents of the fat were palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1,n-9), gadoleic acid (20:1,n-9) and erucic acid (22:1,n-9). Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were predominant among the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). There was a significant difference between the groups in relation to the content of stearic acid (18:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1,n-9) and oleic acid (18:1,n-9).

AB  - Artificial reconditioning of Atlantic salmon in fresh water over two successive years produced kelt survival rates of 28% and 55% in years one and two, respectively. Eye damage and failure to identify non-feeders were important factors contributing to high mortalities. Average fecundities of kelts reconditioned for the first (1220 ova kg-1) and second (1093 ova kg-1) year were lower than obtained for virgin control fish (1590 and 1728 ova kg-1 respectively). Average survival to swim-up for progeny of first-year (64.5%) and second-year (71.4%) reconditioned fish were similar to survival of virgin control fish progeny (72.3% and 68.9% respectively). Ranched kelts showed better growth parameters than for freshwater reconditioning but had lower average fecundities (1310 ova kg-1 compared with 1820 ova kg-1) and lower average progeny survival to swim-up (60.8% compared with 88.6%) than their control group.

AB  - An estimate for effective migration among populations of anadromous Atlantic salmon is Nm 1. The gene flow estimation is based on (i) the use of the coefficient F,, and (ii) Slatkin’s method of conditional average frequencies of alleles and (iii) his method of rare alleles as indicators. Two data sets were constructed from protein polymorphism studies. The first involved allele frequences of the 4 most variable loci at 89 sampling locations, and the second included 38 loci at 57 locations. Locations cover the whole distribution of the Atlantic salmon, including the Baltic Sea, and Eastern and Western Atlantic Ocean. Only anadromous and natural populations with a minimum sample size of 10 individuals were included. Mean sample sizes were 66 and 56 individuals per location in the data sets one and two, respectively. Three approximate limits are suggested to define the units for conservation of genetic variation, Nm = 1, 4Ns = 1, and m/s = 1, where s is the selection coefficient. Based on these limits, six propositions are derived. The propositions are used to evaluate situations where selection overcomes the effects of random drift and gene flow. Response of population to local selection is proposed as a criterion in preservation of genetic variation for breeding and ranching purposes.

AB  - In stock enhancement and sea-ranching procedures, the adipose fin of hundreds of millions of salmonids is removed for marking purposes annually. However, recent studies proved the significance of the adipose fin as a flow sensor and attraction feature. In the present study, we profiled the specific expression of 20 neuron- and glial cell-marker genes in the adipose fin and seven other tissues (including dorsal and pectoral fin, brain, skin, muscle, head kidney, and liver) of the salmonid species rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and maraena whitefish Coregonus maraena. Moreover, we measured the transcript abundance of genes coding for 15 mechanoreceptive channel proteins from a variety of mechanoreceptors known in vertebrates. The overall expression patterns indicate the presence of the entire repertoire of neurons, glial cells and receptor proteins on the RNA level. This quantification suggests that the adipose fin contains considerable amounts of small nerve fibers with unmyelinated or slightly myelinated axons and most likely mechanoreceptive potential. The findings are consistent for both rainbow trout and maraena whitefish and support a previous hypothesis about the innervation and potential flow sensory function of the adipose fin. Moreover, our data suggest that the resection of the adipose fin has a stronger impact on the welfare of salmonid fish than previously assumed.

AB  - Bekkevold, D., Hansen, M. M., and Nielsen, E. E. 2006. Genetic impact of gadoid culture on wild fish populations: predictions, lessons from salmonids, and possibilities for minimizing adverse effects. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 63: 198e208. Little is known about the effects of ranched gadoids escaping into wild populations, and plans for substantial up-scaling of gadoid mariculture raise concerns about detrimental effects on local gene pools. Genetic studies from salmonid populations subjected to intentional or unintentional releases of hatchery-produced fish suggest that wild gene pools are affected by introgression, but that the genetic impact can be minor relative to expectations from the often substantial numbers of released hatchery fish. However, even if resilience to introgression is a general trend, wild population fitness is still predicted to be jeopardized by releases. In this paper, we review theoretical genetic effects of escapes of cultivated individuals and the empirical evidence for introgression effects, which are based mainly on salmonid studies. Based on knowledge of gadoid population structure and life history traits, we make predictions for effects of gadoid mariculture on wild populations and discuss approaches for monitoring and minimizing introgression effects.

AB  - A laboratory study of the social behaviour and growth performance of juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta of wild and sea-ranched origin and their crosses, indicated that the social behaviour of wild and sea-ranched fish differed. Male and female parents seemed to have a different impact on the juveniles. The category having wild mother and sea-ranched father were less aggressive, less active in general, but active in feeding, and therefore had higher growth rates. This pattern arose despite that the feeding rate and the motivation to first get a food item when food was provided did not differ between the groups of fish. Wild fish tended to be most aggressive. If sea-ranched and wild fish have different intrinsic (genetically based) ‘life styles’, the crosses between wild and sea-ranched fish indicate that there is likelihood for an introgression of genes adapted to hatchery environment into the genetics of wild conspecifics. This is particularly serious when hatchery-reared fish invades wild populations over many years.

AB  -. This study describes differences in scale characters between fanned, ranched and wild Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar h., and proposes a method to distinguish between the different groups. Six characters were found to differ: (1) smolt size; (2) smolt age; (3) transition from fresh water to salt water; (4) sea winter bands; (5) summer checks; (6) replacement scales. The combined use of these characters in a score system gave good separation between fanned and wild salmon, but not for ranched salmon.

AB  - The potential impact of sea lice infestation on outwardly migrating Atlantic salmon smolts has been investigated by treating populations of ranched salmon, prior to release, with a prophylactic sea lice treatment conferring protection from sea lice infestation, for up to 9 weeks. Established populations of ranched Atlantic salmon with well described rates of return were chosen to investigate the potential contribution of early infestation with the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis to mortality in Atlantic salmon. Results of five releases from four locations are presented and compared with a time series of releases from Lough Furnace in Newport, County Mayo. The results of this study would suggest that infestation of outwardly migrating salmon smolts with the salmon louse ( L. salmonis ) was a minor component of the overall marine mortality in the stocks studied.

AB  - The impact of salmon lice on the survival of migrating Atlantic salmon smolts was studied by comparing the adult returns of sea-ranched smolts treated for sea lice using emamectin benzoate or substance EX with untreated control groups in the River Dale in western Norway. A total of 143 500 smolts were released in 35 release groups in freshwater from 1997 to 2009 and in the fjord system from 2007 to 2009. The adult recaptures declined gradually with release year and reached minimum levels in 2007. This development corresponded with poor marine growth and increased age at maturity of ranched salmon and in three monitored salmon populations and indicated unfavourable conditions in the Norwegian Sea. The recapture rate of treated smolts was significantly higher than the controls in three of the releases performed: the only release in 1997, one of three in 2002 and the only group released in sea water in 2007. The effect of treating the smolts against salmon lice was smaller than the variability in return rates between release groups, and much smaller that variability between release years, but its overall contribution was still significant (P < 0.05) and equivalent to an odds ratio of the probability of being recaptured of 1.17 in favour of the treated smolts. Control fish also tended to be smaller as grilse (P = 0.057), possibly due to a sublethal effect of salmon lice.

AB  - Sea lice infestation as a source of marine mortality of outwardly migrating Atlantic salmon smolts has been investigated by treating groups of ranched salmon, prior to release, with a prophylactic sea lice treatment conferring protection from sea lice infestation. A number of studies have been carried out in Ireland using both established ranched populations and groups of hatchery reared fish imprinted for 5–8 weeks in the sites of experimental releases. In this study, data on 352 142 migrating salmon from twenty-eight releases, at eight locations along Ireland’s South and West coasts covering a 9-year period (2001 to 2009) are reviewed. Both published and new data are presented including a previously unpublished time series. The results of a meta-analysis of the combined data suggest that while sea lice-induced mortality on outwardly migrating smolts can be significant, it is a minor and irregular component of marine mortality in the stocks studied and is unlikely to be a significant factor influencing conservation status of salmon stocks.

AB  - The assessment report of the 4th International Panel on Climate Change confirms that global warming is strongly affecting biological systems and that 20-30% of species risk extinction from projected future increases in temperature. It is essential that any measures taken to conserve individual species and their constituent populations against climate-mediated declines are appropriate. The release of captive bred animals to augment wild populations is a widespread management strategy for many species but has proven controversial. Using a regression model based on a 37-year study of wild and sea ranched Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) spawning together in the wild, we show that the escape of captive bred animals into the wild can substantially depress recruitment and more specifically disrupt the capacity of natural populations to adapt to higher winter water temperatures associated with climate variability. We speculate the mechanisms underlying this seasonal response and suggest that an explanation based on bio-energetic processes with physiological responses synchronized by photoperiod is plausible. Furthermore, we predict, by running the model forward using projected future climate scenarios, that these cultured fish substantially increase the risk of extinction for the studied population within 20 generations. In contrast, we show that positive outcomes to climate change are possible if captive bred animals are prevented from breeding in the wild. Rather than imposing an additional genetic load on wild populations by releasing maladapted captive bred animals, we propose that conservation efforts should focus on optimizing conditions for adaptation to occur by reducing exploitation and protecting critical habitats. Our findings are likely to hold true for most poikilothermic species where captive breeding programmes are used in population management.

AB  - Pyrethroids are synthetic derivatives of pyrethrin insecticides whose urban usage and continuous municipal wastewater discharge results in pseudo-persistent levels in Northern California waterways. Climate change causes warmer global temperatures which diminishes snowfall and reduces freshwater input into the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD) resulting in increased salinity over time. The SFBD and its drainage serve as spawning and rearing habitat for salmonid species and is under threat by multiple stressors including pesticide pollution. Endocrine disrupting effects of bifenthrin at low-level exposures were investigated in laboratory and field experiments. 96-Hour laboratory exposures to bifenthrin (1 ng/L to 10 ug/L) showed no changes in plasma levels of the estrogenic biomarker, vitellogenin (VTG) protein, nor changes of the sex steroids testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and 17beta-estradiol (E2) levels in two salmonid species: Oncorhynchus mykiss and Oncorhynchus tshawytscha . Field exposures using storm water containing bifenthrin, also showed no significant change in VTG or sex steroid levels in both fish species, suggesting short-term low dose exposure to bifenthrin does not result in estrogenic activity in salmonids. To evaluate the impacts of hypersaline conditions on bifenthrin toxicity, a 14-day laboratory exposure was performed using two populations of O. mykiss acclimated to freshwater, 8 g/L, and 17g/L salinity and then exposed to 0, 0.1, and 1.5 ug/L bifenthrin. The first population (Jess Ranch) was previously treated as embryos with high levels of E2 to obtain uni-gender populations, while the second population (Nimbus Hatchery) was cultured without hormone treatment. Only Jess Ranch fish exhibited significant mortality following exposure to 1.5 ug/L bifenthrin in freshwater. No significant difference was observed in VTG levels in either population. Jess Ranch Fish showed no significant difference in T, 11-KT, or E2 levels. Nimbus fish only showed a significant increase in E2 following exposure to 1.5 ug/L bifenthrin in freshwater. In vitro biotransformation studies using livers were also performed. Saltwater acclimation significantly reduced conversion of bifenthrin to polar metabolites in Jess Ranch fish. This study suggests that embryonic exposure to estrogens can increase susceptibility to bifenthrin in freshwater fish and saline acclimation protects against acute lethality through an unknown mechanism.

AB  - This study addressed two hypotheses: (1) that individual recognition is used to reduce the cost of contesting resources in sea trout and (2) that the hatchery environment selects against individual recognition. Predictions from these hypotheses were tested in laboratory experiments where behavior and growth were studied in juvenile sea trout Intact groups of familiar fish were compared with groups that contained both familiar and unfamiliar individuals. In general, die results were in agreement with the first hypothesis. Familiar fish in intact groups had more stable dominance ranks, higher food intake, and better utilization of food. Familiarity also reduced the distance to the nearest neighbor. Furthermore, initiators of conflicts were more likely to win against familiar fish than against strangers. These results support game-theory-based hypotheses explaining the dear-enemy phenomenon as an effect of familiarity. A picture emerges in which familiarity stabilizes the hierarchical structure of a group and governs behavioral modifications that will promote feeding and growth, in turn leading to higher fitness. The second hypothesis, which predicted a reduced effect of individual recognition in sea-ranched trout, was not strongly supported because familiarity affected sea-ranched and wild trout similarly in most respects. However, familiarity was not beneficial for growth in sea-ranched trout, whereas it increased growth rate in wild fish. In addition, sea-ranched trout tended to maintain larger distances to their nearest neighbors than did wild trout

AB  - The salmon industry has steadily developed during the last two decades, leading to an increasing awareness about the legal problems that need to be solved. Both production in ocean ranching and in captivity have prompted the enactment of important rules of international and domestic law. While international law has provided for a basic regulatory framework, embodied in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and a number of regional and bilateral treaties, domestic law has concentrated on the specific technical issues that relate to conservation, fishing rights, and organization of the industry generally. The article discusses the aggregate of legal rules applicable to salmon production, including the comparative law perspective emerging from the national legislations of the main producers in the world. Various legal and economic models are identified and their incidence on the industry is examined in light of actual experiences. The rules of international law in the field are becomin...

AB  - Two distinct stress coping strategies, proactive and reactive, have been stated in various animal studies, each associated with a set of behavioural and physiological characteristics. In a given challenging situation, proactive animals show more aggression, a higher general activity and a predominant sympathetic reaction. In contrast, the reactive copers respond more with immobility and avoidance, and a predominant parasympathetic/hypothalamic activation. This divergence in coping has also been indicated in salmonid fish. Interestingly, many of the differences reported between sea-ranched and wild fish resembles characteristics that differentiate proactive and reactive copers. In the present thesis it is shown that individuals with divergent stress coping styles are identifiable in several brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations. Further, the results show that the distribution of individuals displaying these distinct stress coping strategies differs between populations. This strongly indicates that these traits are heritable and that the variation in selection regime in the native rivers influences these traits. In addition, the results show that populations with hatchery origin are biased towards having higher frequencies of trout displaying a proactive style than populations having wild origin. Also, even though the frequency of early sexual maturation, known as a viable alternative life history in salmonids, differs between populations of brown trout, no link between stress coping strategy and early sexual maturation were found. However, this thesis show that maternal contribution, in the form of egg size, is of major importance whether the progeny will sexually mature early and that it also might be of importance for stress coping strategy. Further, correlations of traits commonly associated with stress coping strategies and behavioural syndromes across context and over time is investigated. The results show that individuals with a strong sympathetic reactivity are more prone to change their behaviour than others.

AB  - The supportive breeding programme for sea trout (Salmo trutta) in the River Dalalven, Sweden, is based on a sea-ranched hatchery stock of local origin that has been kept 'closed' to the immigration of wild genes since the late 1960s (about seven generations). In spite of an apparent potential for substantial uni directional gene flow from sea-ranched to wild (naturally produced) trout, phenotypic differences with a presumed genetic basis have previously been observed between the two 'stocks'. Likewise, two previous studies of allozyme and mitochondrial DNA variation based on a single year of sampling have indicated genetic differentiation. In the present study we used microsatellite and allozyme data collected over four consecutive years, and tested for the existence of overall genetic stock divergence while accounting for temporal heterogeneity. Statistical analyses of allele frequency variation (F-statistics) and multilocus genotypes (assignment tests) revealed that wild and sea-ranched trout were significantly different in three of four years, whereas no overall genetic divergence could be found when temporal heterogeneity among years within stocks was accounted for. On the basis of estimates of effective population size in the two stocks, and of FST between them, we also assessed the level of gene flow from sea-ranched to wild trout to be approximately 80% per generation (with a lower confidence limit of approximately 20%). The results suggest that the reproductive success of hatchery and naturally produced trout may be quite similar in the wild, and that the genetic characteristics of the wild stock are largely determined by introgressed genes from sea-ranched fish.

AB  - More than 26 billion juveniles of 180 marine species are released annually into the wild in over 20 countries, but the usefulness of this strategy remains unclear. Here, I analyse the effects of stocking by Japanese marine and salmon stock-enhancement programmes and evaluate their efficacy through a novel Bayesian meta-analysis of new and previously considered cases. The posterior mean recapture rate (± SD) was 8.3 ± 4.7%. Without considering personnel costs and negative impacts on wild populations, the mean economic efficiency was 2.8 ± 6.1, with many cases having values of 1 to 2. On the macro-scale, the proportion of released seeds to total catch was 76 ± 20% for Japanese scallop, 28 ± 10% for abalone, 20 ± 5% for swimming crab, 13 ± 5% for kuruma prawn, 11 ± 4% for Japanese flounder, and 7 ± 2% for red sea bream; according to these percentages, stocking effects were generally small, and population dynamics were unaffected by releases but dependent on the carrying capacity of the nursery habitat. All cases of Japanese hatchery releases, except for Japanese scallop, were economically unprofitable. Captive breeding reduces the fitness of hatchery fish in the wild. In addition, long-term hatchery releases replace wild genes and cause fitness decline in the recipient population when the proportion of hatchery fish is very high. Short-term hatchery stocking can be useful, particularly for conservation purposes, but large-scale programmes harm the sustainability of populations. Nursery habitat recovery and fishing pressure reduction outperform hatcheries in the long run.

TY  - CHAP
AB  - The focus now moves to the factors affecting the availability of wild salmon. This chapter discusses the management of fishing effort while Chapter 4 is concerned with salmon ranching and the artificial enhancement of salmon stocks. As the previous chapter has already suggested, there are substantial differences between fisheries. Japan has been steadily increasing salmon landings, a trend associated with successful private stock enhancement programmes. In the North American fisheries, experiences vary by area, species and stock. In general landings have risen but distribution has changed. Thus increasing quantities of salmon are taken in Alaskan waters partly at the expense of landings elsewhere in North America, partly because of the protection provided by 200-mile zones and partly because of changing environmental conditions. In the Atlantic, catches are currently considerably below earlier levels. However in spite of this diversity of experience, the same management issues affect all salmon fisheries and are inherent in the management of salmon as a renewable natural resource.

AB  - In the breeding system of Pacific salmon, females compete for oviposition territories, and males compete to fertilize eggs. The natural selection in females and sexual selection in males likely has been responsible for their elaborate breeding morphologies and the dimorphism between the sexes. We quantified direct-selection intensities during breeding on mature coho salmon (On- corhynchus kisutch), measured for seven phenotypic characters, including three secondary sexual characters. Wild and sea-ranched hatchery coho were used to enhance the range of phenotypes over which selection could be examined. The fish were allowed to breed in experimental arenas where we could quantify components of breeding success as well as estimate overall breeding success. We found that without competition, natural selection acts only on female body size for increased egg production; there is no detectable selection on males for the phenotypic distribution we used. Under competition, the opportunity for selection increased sixfold among females. Natural selection favored female body size and caudal-peduncle (tail) depth. Increased body size meant increased egg production and access to nesting territories. The caudal peduncle, used in burst swimming and nest digging, influenced both successful egg deposition and nest survival. Increasing density increased competition among females, though it did not significantly intensify natural selection on their characters. In males, competition increased the opportunity for selection 52- fold, which was nine times greater than for females. Sexual selection favored male body size and hooked snout length, both characters directly influencing male access to spawning opportunities. Selection on male body size was also affected significantly by breeding density. The ability of large males to control access to spawning females decreased at higher densities reflecting an increase in the operational sex ratio. Further, the relative success of small males, which could sneak access to spawning females, appeared to increase as that of intermediate-sized males decreased. Such dis- ruptive selection may be responsible for the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics in salmon.

AB  - The freshwater phase of the first seaward migration of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is relatively well understood when compared with our understanding of the marine phase of their migration. In 2021, 1008 wild and 60 ranched Atlantic salmon smolts were tagged with acoustic transmitters in 12 rivers in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland. Large marine receiver arrays were deployed in the Irish Sea at two locations: at the transition of the Irish Sea into the North Atlantic between Ireland and Scotland, and between southern Scotland and Northern Ireland, to examine the early phase of the marine migration of Atlantic salmon smolts. After leaving their natal rivers' post-smolt migration through the Irish Sea was rapid with minimum speeds ranging from 14.03 to 38.56 km.day<sup>-1</sup> for Atlantic salmon smolts that entered the Irish Sea directly from their natal river, to 9.69-39.94 km.day<sup>-1</sup> for Atlantic salmon smolts that entered the Irish Sea directly from their natal estuary. Population minimum migration success through the study area was strongly correlated with the distance of travel, populations further away from the point of entry to the open North Atlantic exhibited lower migration success. Post-smolts from different populations experienced different water temperatures on entering the North Atlantic. This was largely driven by the timing of their migration and may have significant consequences for feeding and ultimately survivorship. The influence of water currents on post-smolt movement was investigated using data from previously constructed numerical hydrodynamic models. Modeled water current data in the northern Irish Sea showed that post-smolts had a strong preference for migrating when the current direction was at around 283° (west-north-west) but did not migrate when exposed to strong currents in other directions. This is the most favorable direction for onward passage from the Irish Sea to the continental shelf edge current, a known accumulation point for migrating post-smolts. These results strongly indicate that post-smolts migrating through the coastal marine environment are: (1) not simply migrating by current following (2) engage in active directional swimming (3) have an intrinsic sense of their migration direction and (4) can use cues other than water current direction to orientate during this part of their migration.

To be more specific, I want to describe how we on the Gover Ranch stimulate salmon and steelhead production through the performance of sound range management practices. We operate 14,000 acres of rangeland adjoining Battle Creek and the Sacramento River in Shasta County, California. This land is 100 air miles from the ocean; however, it is 200 miles as a fish swims. What we do on our range lands affects a multitude of wildlife because it is the residence of hundreds of deer, birds of many kinds, and fronts on seven miles of trout and salmon streams. I could spend a considerable amount of time telling you of the many popular and accepted practices we do to provide improved cover that benefit wildlife. These include leaving 300 to 400ft wide strips of brush along streams, piling brush to protect bird life, manipulating brush to provide browse for deer and similar practices. These, however, are accepted and well known to all of us. We have what we believe to be a unique situ-

AB  - W 7HILE collecting fish from spring creeks near Jackson, Wyoming, on February 20, 1940, our attention was drawn to egg clusters of the sculpin, Cottus semiscaber (Cope). Again the following year, on March 2, numerous egg masses were seen on the under-surface of rocks in the springs where sculpin were collected. Beginning February 15, 1942, the springs were visited numerous times for the purpose of establishing more exactly the time and extent of the spawning season, and for gathering other pertinent data. Two springs were visited regularly: Tanner Spring, with a temperature of 48?'F., and the Government Ranch Spring, with temperatures of 45? to 48?. Both springs are tributary to Flat Creek, Teton County. In the headwaters of both, where the sculpin spawn, the bottom is composed of coarse gravel, interspersed with large irregularly shaped rocks. Tanner Spring contains an abundance of water cress. At lower levels of both creeks the bottoms are excessively muddy. Sculpin do not spawn in the muddy areas. The velocity of the water seemed to make no difference in the choice of a "nest rock." Egg clusters were found where the current was rapid and also where it was almost non-existent. During the 1942 season, egg clusters were first seen on March 6 at Tanner Spring. Some had reached the eye spot stage on this date; others were newly laid. Eggs collected then hatched within five days in an aquarium. On March 20, March 25 and April 5, at the same spring, both eyed and uneyed eggs were located. No eggs could be found on the last visit to the spring on April 16. At the Government Ranch Spring the first cluster of eggs (uneyed) was found March 25 (water temperature 45? F.). On April 16, April 28 and May 10, gravid females were located, as well as egg clusters (water temperature 48?). The last eggs, which were eyed, were found May 26. This sculpin's eggs are usually salmon colored; occasionally a light yellow mass of them is seen. They are strongly adhesive and are laid in clusters on the under-surface of rocks (Plate I), rarely on vegetation or on the stream bottom if rocks are available. Shallow, scooped-out depressions or nests, usually occupied by the sculpin, were found under some rocks. Eggs may be removed easily from the rocks without separating from each other. The clusters average in size about 24 x 40 mm., and are usually about the depth of seven eggs. Although no compound clusters were found, occasional egg clusters of slightly different color and in different stages of development were observed close together on the same rock, possibly the product of different females. The individual eggs averaged 2.47 mm. in diameter; those from the ovaries of females ready to spawn measured 2.2 mm. There was an average of 354 eggs per cluster in those collected from rocks, and an average of 629 eggs in the ovaries of females nearly ready to spawn. Measurements and counts were made from six egg clusters.

AB  - We used organochlorine fingerprinting to identify the principal marine foraging area in a sea-ranched population of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from Denmark. The results of this study, the first to apply the method to teleosts, suggest that Atlantic salmon released as juveniles (age 1) in the River Gudenaa, Denmark, are utilizing the North Sea and not the Baltic Sea as their principal marine foraging area.

AB  - When Gold Rush fever gripped the globe in 1849, thousands of Chinese came through San Francisco to seek fortune. In "The Poker Bride," Christopher Corbett uses a legend of one extraordinary woman as a lens into this experience. Before 1849, the Chinese in the United States were little more than curiosities. But as word spread of gold in California, San Francisco's labyrinthine Chinatown sprang up, a city-within-a-city full of exotic foods and strange smells where Chinese women were smuggled into the country. At this time Polly, a young Chinese concubine, was brought by her owner to a remote mining camp in the highlands of Idaho, where he lost her in a poker game. Polly and her new owner then settled at an isolated ranch on the banks of the Salmon River. As the Gold Rush receded, it took with it the Chinese miners, but left behind Polly, who would make headlines when as an old woman she emerged from the Idaho hills nearly half a century later to tell her astounding story. "The Poker Bride" reconstructs a tale of the real American West: a place where the first Chinese flooded the country and left their mark long after the craze for gold had vanished."

AB  - The migratory behaviour of sea-ranched Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., was analysed by radio-telemetry in the River Gudenaa, Denmark. The main objectives were to: (1) estimate mortality of returning adults through the fjord; (2) observe rate of progression and migratory pattern in the fjord and river; and (3) record whether spawning occurs in the river. Forty-two returning salmon (19 males and 23 females of total body length from 60–97 cm) reared and released as smolts, were caught and equipped with external radio transmitters in the outer estuary of the River Gudenaa in 1994 and 1995. Of the tagged salmon, 18 (43%) were caught in the estuary, four (10%) were not recorded after release and 20 (47%) entered the river. The mean rate of progression through the fjord was 7.6 km d−1 (range 1.4–18.2) in 1994 and 5.4 km  d−1 (range 1.6–17.1) in 1995. Eleven salmon were alive at the onset of the spawning period. Eight were retrieved dead from the river during or after the spawning period; four with empty gonads assumed to be successful spawners, and four with intact gonads. In 1994, unsuccessful spawners (found dead with intact gonads) entered the river earlier and had a longer total migration distance in the river compared to successful spawners. This suggests that spawning success of sea-ranched salmon is associated with time of river entry and river migration length.

AB  - The Norwegian Sea Ranching Program (PUSH, acronym for Program for Utvikling og Stimulering av Havbeite) was started in 1990 and is scheduled to terminate by the end of 1997. The program has focused on four species: Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), cod (Gadus morhua), and European lobster (Homarus gammarus), with the main objective of examining both the biological and economic basis for sea ranching. In the present study, profitability analyses have been conducted by the net present value (NPV) method and application of available data from a research program. From the results, we conclude that sea ranching of Arctic charr will not be economically profitable at the present juvenile costs, recapture rate, and market price and that this conclusion is unlikely to change in the near future. For Atlantic salmon the activity will be profitable only if the present recapture rate more than doubles, to approximately 10%. On the basis of the present juvenile cost, recapture rate, and market price for European lobster, the analyses show negative net present values. These results indicate that, to reach profitability, juvenile lobster production costs must be reduced 50% and the release strategy simultaneously optimized to increase the recapture rate to approximately 15%.

AB  - There are over 40,000 small ranch ponds in Montana. More than threefourths of these were constructed solely for stock-water purposes and most of the others for either irrigation or the control of erosion. Fewer than 50 are known to have been built specifically for fish. (Brown and Thoreson, 1951). While approximately 700 ponds have been stocked with fish of one species or another, less than 100 are known to have produced any appreciable fishing. During 1949 and 1950, the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station and the Montana State Fish and Game Department conducted a cooperative investigation of existing Montana ranch ponds to explore their suitability for fish. About 20 ponds scattered over the eastern (plains) part of the state were examined at regular intervals throughout all seasons and inventories were made on a large number of other ponds as time permitted. The data included certain physical, chemical and biological information considered essential to an understanding of fish production. A summary of the physical-chemical information collected on twelve ponds is given in Table 1. The most striking physical feature is the prevailing low temperature even during the summer period. The water in ponds of this area is generally quite alkaline with the pH as great as 10.0 and total alkalinities (methyl orange) as high as 325 ppm. While aquatic plants of varied species are present in many ponds, they have not been found detrimental in ponds which were deep enough to insure fish production. In one small pond, mortality of trout was definitely attributed to low dissolved oxygen resulting from duck weed (Lemna) which completely covered the surface and which was found in large quantities, decaying on the bottom. Past records show that the following fish species have been planted in Monta a ponds: rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta), cutthroat trout (Salmo clarkii lewisii), bl egills (Lepomis machrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), black crappie (Pomoxis nigro-maculatus), y llow perch (Perca flavescens), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), northern pike (Esox lucius), black bullheads (Ameiurus melas), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), and bluntnose minnow (Hyborhynchus notatus).

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To address population declines, many salmon populations are supplemented with hatchery-bred fish. Little is known about how growth performance of hatchery-bred and wild salmon compare during critical periods such as the first summer at sea. This study compares scale growth measurements between 1725 ranched and 1976 wild salmon from the Burrishoole catchment (western Ireland) over 62 years (1956–2017). Post-smolt growth (PSG) was greater in wild than ranched fish; this difference was consistent with compensatory growth rather than size-dependant growth. Temporal trends in marine growth of wild and ranched fish were similar, with a marked decline in PSG and return size after the early 2000s. The decline in PSG was significantly related to freshwater growth and autumn sea surface temperature in the Norwegian Sea. Temporal changes in the pattern of intercirculi spacings along the PSG growth trajectory were also identified; circuli deposited during the first summer at sea were narrower in the 2000s and 2010s compared to earlier decades, while circuli from the first winter were wider. The recent decline in growth affects both populations similarly, is associated with increasing temperature and is manifested as a change in growth pattern as well as overall growth.</jats:p>

AB  - Quesnel Terrane, at Quesnel Lake, consists of two regional Triassic–Jurassic age-equivalent units, the Takla–Nicola and Slocan – King Salmon assemblages, as determined from conodonts and macrofossils. The upper mainly volcanic unit (Takla–Nicola) overlies the mainly pelitic unit (Slocan – King Salmon) and was probably emplaced by thrusting. The lower unit consists of dark grey pelite, siltite, limestone, and lesser amounts of fragmental basalt and greywacke. The upper unit consists of fragmental basalt, diorite, greywacke, and lesser amounts of dark grey siltite and pelite and limestone. The unit age and stacking order suggest that during the Jurassic, the volcanic-rich thrust sheet was transported northeastward over an eastern, more pelitic facies of the terrane. The northwesterly trending thrust trace is approximately 300 km long. The Triassic and Lower Jurassic subduction-generated volcanic unit may have been deposited on sediments and volcanics equivalent to the upper Paleozoic Harper Ranch Group; the...

AB  - Tagging data were used to examine the relationships between smolt size, post-smolt growth and sea age at first maturity for the short-migrating Neva strain of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) ranched in the Bothnian Sea and the Gulf of Finland. The results provided evidence that post-smolt growth was influenced by both relative and absolute smolt size. For both sea-areas, 2-year smolts of small relative size within a release group grew more rapidly in the sea than did smolts of higher relative, but equivalent absolute size. The negative influence of increasing relative smolt size on marine growth was, however, outweighed by the stronger positive influence of increasing absolute smolt size. A 160-mm increase in smolt size (140–300 mm) resulted in an overall growth advantage of about 1 year. In the Bothnian Sea, the predicted mean length after 1 year in the sea was 288 ± 25 mm for 140-mm smolts and 560 ± 16 mm for 300-mm smolts. Under the more favourable conditions of the Gulf of Finland, the respective mean lengths were 369 ± 15 mm and 613 ± 12 mm. The sea age at first maturity was inversely related to both freshwater and marine growth rates. For both sea areas, large smolts yielded proportionately more grilse than did small ones. Smolt years with good post-smolt growth rates yielded more grilse than did years with poor growth rates. The overall level of grilsing was higher in the Gulf of Finland than in the Bothnian Sea. These results suggest that the relationships between smolt size, post-smolt growth and age at first maturity in the sea are influenced by the environmental conditions of the respective sea area. A framework explaining the links between smolt size, marine growth, survival and sea age at maturity in Neva salmon is presented for the Gulf of Finland and the Bothnian Sea.

AB  - Reproductive behaviour and factors associated with male and female mating success were studied in sea trout (Salmo trutta) in a stream water aquarium, during three successive years. We compared a sea-ranched and a wild-produced strain, both of the same genetic origin. In general, dominant males courted females more often, spent more time on the spawnable areas, and had higher mating success than lower ranked males. Body mass explained about 18% of the males' position in the dominance hierarchy. Sea-ranched males, however, achieved on average fewer matings than wild ones. Wild males courted the nest-preparing females and chased away other males more frequently than did the sea-ranched males. Females were observed to be aggressive towards males, especially when the females were preparing a nest. The males that were more frequently the target of female aggression had smaller adipose fins and were more often aggressive towards females. In general the females spawned just once in each nest. Sea-ranched females defended and tested their redd less frequently than the wild females did. Digging activity by wild females diminished closer to spawning time, but not that of the sea-ranched females. To what extent the observed differences were due to the environmental conditions or to genetic differences is not known at present. However, the results of previous studies have revealed that behavioural and morphological differences exist between the strains, despite being reared under the same conditions. Thus, the behavioural changes noted in the sea-ranched sea-trout might have a genetic element.

AB  - The body size, ovary mass, egg mass, and fecundity of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch from three different rearing environments (wild, ranched, and captive) were compared to determine which aspects of growth history affect changes in these reproductive characters. In addition, the growth of individually tagged females reared in captivity throughout the seawater growth phase was measured and related to final reproductive investment. A strong positive relationship existed between ovary mass and body length at spawning; this relationship was maintained over a wide range of final body sizes, and the regression slope was consistent among the rearing environments. However, the relative investment in ovary mass and fecundity (regression intercepts) differed between rearing environments. Fish reared in captivity throughout their life cycle had higher values than did fish reared in the other two environments. A relatively weak positive relationship between egg mass and final body length was common to fem...

AB  - <jats:p>Sea ranched hatchery-reared smolts of Atlantic salmon originating from the Rivers Imsa and Lone in Norway and Neva in USSR were released in the River Akerselv, in 1985 and 1987. Both 1+ and 2+ smolts were released into the river which had been empty of fish due to heavy pollution from the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the l980ies. The Norwegian salmon migrated to sea and left the Oslofjord shortly after release. The Neva salmon, on the other hand, stayed in the Oslofjord during the summer after release, and many turned up as maturing adults the first autumn after release. Few recaptures were made the following summer as grilse. The reported recapture-rate varied between 7.1 and 19.1% of the number of smolts released. Few fish strayed to other rivers; those that did entered nearby rivers. Mean weight of grilse produced from 2+ smolts, reflecting differences in size at release. Reported yields per 1000 smolts released varied between 77.5 and 138.4 kg, it was lowest for 2+ Lone smolts and highest for 2+ Neva smolts. These figures are gross underestimates when taking tagging and handling mortality and non-reported tags into consideration.</jats:p>

AB  - The main question which must be raised when planning to enhance natural populations through sea ranching is whether reared organisms are fit for a life in the wild, or more specifically, whether there are differences between reared and naturally resident individuals. The causes and effects of these differences are reviewed, and results from the Norwegian enhancement programme, which compared reared and wild individuals of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L., and European lobster, Homarus gammarus L., are discussed with emphasis on morphological and behavioural differences. It was concluded that exposure to an artificial rearing environment during ontogeny can affect both the phenotype and the behaviour of the reared individuals, and thereby, their potential for survival after release into the wild as well. Suggestions are made as to how to diminish observed differences, and thereby, improve the survival potential.

AB  - Thistle at Rogue River on June 1, 1893. Her master, Captain Frederick Schwarz, had aboard a cargo of general merchandise that he intended to use in the service of his employer, the Alaska Packers Association, to break the unique monopoly of Robert Deniston Hume.' Upon debarking from the Thistle, the Captain announced a schooner would soon arrive carrying material for salting and barreling the salmon that were the economic foundation of the lower Rogue region and the chief source of the fortune of R. D. Hume, the "King of the Rogue." As a young man of 19 years, with one dollar in his pocket, R. D. Hume reached California in 1864, joined his brothers George and William on the Sacramento River, and with them was the first on the Pacific Coast to can salmon successfully.2 In 1866, because of the depletion of the Sacramento runs, the three Hume brothers pioneered the large-scale development of the Columbia River salmon canning industry, and, joined by another brother, Joseph, they separately erected several canneries on that broad river of the North. Here R. D. Hume prospered in the decade 1866-1876, operating canneries at Astoria, Bay View, Eagle Cliff, and Rainier on the Columbia." In 1876, however, Hume's wife died shortly after the death of their son. Saddened by this tragedy, which occurred only five years after the death of his infant daughter, the young canner left the Columbia to seek a region where he could rebuild his physical and mental powers.' The following year he bought a small fishery at Gold Beach, Oregon, at the mouth of the Rogue River. There he built salmon hatcheries, and subsequently expanded his business ventures into lumbering, mining, wool, tanbark, ranching, and the operation of a general store."

AB  - This review summarises some results of investigation carried out by Russian scientists, concerning the influence of land/inland water ecotones on fish. The main objectives and hypotheses developing in the framework UNESCO MAB working group "Fish and land/inland ecotones" in Russia are: comparison of fish population in salmonid rivers affected or non-affected by lake-rivers ecotones; small scale ecotone studies of model and restored microhabitat of salmonid rivers; comparison of the ecotone patterns and fish abundance in two rivers differing by historical origin of their ichthyofauna; the analysis of the effect of cattle ranching on fish assemblages distribution, dynamics and productivity along a river course in the steppe zone; and the influence of periodically drying up lakes and ecotones on the dynamics of fish populations in the connected river system.

AB  - Over the last thirty years, the catches of Atlantic salmon in Iceland gradually increased to reach 80 000 fishes in 1978. This increase is due to the possibility for the fishes to grow, to repopulation but also to the total prohibition of sea fishing, thus favouring the development of sea-ranching . The sea-ranching projects conducted since 1963 have enabled return rates of 4-5 % with records of 10-15 %. [...]

AB  - The Oregon State has authorized twelve private firms to release 180 million Coho, Chinook and Chum salmon juveniles in the framework of several sea ranching operations. Including the release of juveniles from State hatcheries, the total future production should reach 258 million. In 1978, this production was of about 84 million salmon juveniles. The Oregon State currently contributes to about 3 % of the total amount of salmon juveniles produced artificially and released in the northern Pacific Ocean. We reckon that the rise of the sea ranching activity in the Oregon State goes hand in hand with a rise in other states or countries, and the future plans for Oregon are to keep contributing to about 3 % of the production.

AB  - A brief, generalized review of the current status of salmonid fisheries on the west and east coasts, and of selected representative waters in the freshwater area is presented. It is concluded that many fish communities and/or fish stocks are depressed, collapsed, or extinct as a result of severe stresses imposed directly, or indirectly, by man’s activities. Rehabilitation of fish stocks and fish communities to levels approximating those of early years, and to levels capable of supporting more stable yields to meet growing client requirements appears practical. The need for explicit policy decisions with regard to sea ranching and rehabilitation as options for approaches to increasing fish abundance is stressed. Rehabilitation of stocks and communities will require additional science in areas such as hatching, rearing and selective breeding, fisheries engineering, and in the more precise definition of natural productive capacity of waters. Effective fisheries rehabilitation programs, and fisheries manageme...

AB  - Sea ranching or artificial recruitment of aquatic organisms into their natural habitat for stock improvement or enhancing the production or for conservation of resources, though practised intensely only in recent years, is an age old practice. It is said to have been originated in USA as early as 1870. Ranching of red and . Pacific salmons was being carried out since 1964 in the Far East, and at the present level of ranching, it was estimated that an additional production of 10,000 - 20,000 tonnes/year was realised. In Japan, besides abalone and "kuruma" shrimp (Pellaeus japonicus), the ranching of which started in 1975, about 45 species are ranched to supplement the natural stock.

AB  - In total, 8211 1-year-old and 14839 2-year-old hatchery-reared brown trout, Salmo trutta L., from 11 stocks were released at the mouth of the River Imsa, southwestern Norway. The recapture rates and total estimated yield were higher for 2- than 1-year-old trout, although recapture rates varied between years of release and stocks. The recapture rate increased with mean individual weight at time of release. Total estimated yield from the individual groups of 1+ trout ranged from 2 to 20 kg per 1000 trout released and for 2+ trout between 11 and 250 kg per 1000 fish released. In all cases, yields were lower than the economic break-even yield. Most fish were recaptured the year of release (89.2% of 2+ and 76.2% of 1+ trout). Almost 31% of the recaptures were caught at sea and 69% in fresh water; 95.8% of the latter were taken in the River Imsa trap.

AB  - The Middle Fork Salmon River drainage of the Frank Church River-Of-No-Return Wilderness has a history of livetock grazing from 1890 to1950, and changes in grazing pressure from native ungulates. High mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) popula- tions occurred between 1940 and 1960, and high elk (Cervus elaphus) populations occurred in the 1990s. This paper describes the shrub- steppe communities inside and adjacent to exclosures in the Middle Fork. Also presented is the current vegetative appearance at sites photographed in 1925, 1968, and 1988. Comparisons of plant species composition and characteristics, plus knowledge of grazing history, provide a basis for interpreting vegetation change and relationships to herbivore populations. The Frank Church River-of-No-Return Wilderness has an extensive history of grazing along the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and its major tributaries, dating back to the late 1800s. At Cabin Creek, a tributary to Big Creek approxi- mately 15 miles west of its confluence with the Middle Fork, grazing was initiated in the early 1890s. Cattle were ranched from 1902 to the early 1950s. Saddle and pack stock were grazed from the early 1950s until 1973, when the USDA Forest Service acquired it (Hartung 1978). Sheep, cattle and horses were grazed in the Thomas Creek area beginning in the 1920s, until the Idaho Department of Fish and Game bought the homesteads in the early 1940s (Hamilton 1990). Obvious evidence of the effects of past grazing on vegeta- tion exists in areas such as at Cabin Creek, where wormwood (Artemisia dracunculus), an increaser, is prevalent on south- facing slopes next to abandoned hayfields and pastures that were created in the riparian zones. Exotic species such as spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) have invaded some areas that have not been grazed appreciably in the last half- century, but thus far the presence of these aggressive invad- ers is localized. Currently, grazing of pack and saddle stock is concentrated around inholdings, and effects on plant communities are considered in management.

AB  - Expression of somatolactin (SL) mRNA was quantified during smoltification at 2 week intervals during January and February and weekly during March, April and May 2004 in a line-bred ranching stock of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Gene expression of SL (and a splice variant termed SL180) was lower in fish sampled in the later weeks of smoltification than in those at the beginning, a pattern opposite to that of gill Na+ K+-ATPase activity.

AB  - Two sequential year classes of Atlantic salmon parr, Salmo salar L., from 13 rivers throughout Ireland, genotyped at four widely used microsatellite loci, displayed comparable levels of intra-sample genetic variability to elsewhere in the species range. Temporal allele frequency differences were observed in only one riverine sample, whereas significant spatial differences were evident in all cases, with an overall FST value of 0.03. These spatial differences imply a high degree of natal homing. Two tributaries of a single major river system displayed variability comparable with that within the entire study, suggesting that large rivers may contain several separate tributary populations. Isolation-by-distance analysis suggests the presence of regional structure, which may have been obscured by inclusion of samples from some smaller rivers in Donegal Bay in the north west that are probably affected by incursions of cultured salmon from a nearby ranching operation. Although limited by the small number of loci screened, individual assignment analysis gave levels of self-assignment which would suggest that mixed stock analysis would be feasible as a management tool in Irish salmon fisheries, given the inclusion of larger numbers of microsatellite loci and more extensive coverage of salmon producing rivers.

AB  - Origin and age was determined for individual fish caught in offshore catches of Atlantic salmon stocks (Salmo salar L.) in the Baltic Sea over the years 2000–2009. DNA microsatellite loci and smolt age were used to probabilistically assign returning spawners to their stock of origin. Data for this study were based on approximately 2600 catch samples of the five most common wild and four sea-ranched, hatchery-reared stocks. Spawning age, and sex ratio differed both within and between these wild, and sea-ranched groups. The females were mainly (78.7%) two sea-winters old and the males usually (68.7%) only one sea-winter old. In both sexes, the mean age at maturity was lower in the hatchery-reared, sea-ranched stocks than in naturally reproducing stocks. In the 2000s, there was a weak decreasing trend in the male spawning age, but not in that of females. The sex-ratio of the spawners was female dominant in the naturally reproducing stocks, but male dominant in hatchery-reared stocks. Published historical data from two of the same rivers suggest that the majority of males were multi-sea-winter spawners in the 1930s, and variation in the age distribution of the spawners has become narrower and skewed towards a younger age in the present data (2000–2009) compared to the earlier situation.

Strongly supported by a long-established ammonite zonation, these detailed stratigraphic cross-sections show lateral relations between Edwards Group formations (Kainer, Person, Fort Terrett, Segovia, Fort Lancaster, and Devils River) of the Central Texas Platform with equivalent formations of the East Texas Basin (Walnut, Comanche Peak, Goodland, Georgetown) and the Maverick Basin of South Texas (West Nueces, McKnight, Salmon Peak). These cross-sections document the following regional stratigraphic relationships: The Burt Ranch Member (basal Segovia Formation), the Regional Dense Member (basal Person Formation), and the Kiamichi Member (basal Georgetown Formation) are stratigraphic equivalents, all three being in the Adkinsites bravoensis Ammonite Zone (lowermost Washita)The peritidal Person Formation is the shelf-interior equivalent of the pelagic-shelf Georgetown Formation, except for its uppermost member, the Main Street, which forms the thin remnant Georgetown Formation on the distal Central Texas Platform.Thus the Person Formation is properly assigned to the lower Washita subcycle, not the Fredericksburg.</jats:p>

AB  - The straying rate of ranched Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., into rivers in Iceland was estimated on the basis of coded wire tag recoveries. Out of a total of 15 158 recaptured tagged salmon from the releases between 1987 and 1992, 189 fish (1.3%) strayed into 25 out of the 79 salmon rivers observed. Most of the strayers were found in neighbouring rivers to the ranching stations. There were no significant differences in straying rate between different age classes of salmon returning from the same smolt year class. Generally, there was a delay of 26-27 days in running time between strayers in rivers and salmon returning to the ranching station. Higher straying rates were observed for ranching stations using riverine traps than for stations using estuary traps. By close inspection of seven key rivers in Iceland and assuming a 50% exploitation rate (fishing effort) in the rivers, on average, 2.1% of the returning salmon in ranching were estimated to stray to native salmon rivers over the years. A limitation of using these numbers to estimate geneflow between ranching stocks and wild populations is discussed.

A little before 10:00 A.M., Ava Helen watched as her husband walked towards the coast south of their cabin, but did not notice — as Pauling mistakenly believed she had — as he veered away from the fence line and toward Salmon Cone, a small mountain in the Santa Lucia chain near the Pauling home. Linus was dressed comfortably, wearing slacks, a light jacket, and his signature beret.

The supportive breeders were first‐generation salmon, reared for 1—2 years in a hatchery before being released at the mouth of the river so they could migrate to sea (i.e., sea‐ranching). Wild and sea‐ranched salmon live in the ocean for 1—2 years before they return to the river for spawning. In years when only wild adults were present, mean number of smolts produced per 100 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> river area and female breeder was 0.47. When there were 5% wild females, the mean production was only 0.088 (19%). The gradual decrease in offspring production with decreasing proportion of wild females (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = .41) indicates that the reduced offspring production was caused by inferior spawning behavior of hatchery females or reduced survival of their offspring in nature. Previous experimental evidence suggests that wild males fertilize the eggs of wild but also hatchery females. It is discussed how epigenetic effects caused by hatchery environments influence the developing juveniles, lead to phenotypic changes that may reduce their fitness in nature even after free ranging for a year or more in the ocean before they return and spawn.</jats:p>

Survival and growth of sea-ranched Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., treated against sea lice before release. e ICES Journal of Marine Science, 63: 1317e1325. Cultured Atlantic salmon smolts were treated with Slice, orally administered emamectin benzoate, before release in the Dale River, western Norway, to study the potential effects of sea lice during the early stages of their marine phase. In all, 10 470 treated and untreated (control) fish from ten family groups were adipose fin-clipped, coded-wire tagged, and released on three different dates in 2002 (11 May, 25 May, and 7 June), which coincided with the natural smolt run. The percentage of released smolts recaptured as one-sea-winter salmon in 2003 did not differ between the treated and untreated groups released on the two dates in May 2002, but the recapture rate of fish from the treated group released on 7 June 2002 was almost twice that of the controls. The weights of the recaptured one-sea-winter salmon tended to decline from the first to the third release date, and one-sea-winter salmon from the treated groups were approximately 15% heavier than the controls. The difference in recapture rate between the treated and untreated groups increased after inclusion of the two-sea-winter and three-sea-winter salmon recaptured in 2004 and 2005, respectively. We conclude that the infestation level of salmon lice changed from non-lethal to lethal levels during the period of the smolt migration in 2002 and that non-lethal infestation levels may adversely affect Atlantic salmon populations by reducing the growth rate of fish and, consequently, their size at spawning.

AB  - Although the practice of releasing fish into the wild is common in the management and conservation of fish populations, the success of release programmes and the potential harmful genetic and ecological effects that may follow are rarely considered. This thesis focuses on genetic and ecological consequences of fish releases, exemplified by supportive breeding of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and translocation of European eel (Anguilla anguilla). Specific questions addressed include: What is the relative performance of hatchery produced fish released to support wild populations, and do released hatchery fish contribute to the natural productivity? What is the variation in reproductive success in the wild, and how does it affect the genetic consequences of a supportive breeding programme? Is there a spatial genetic structure in the European eel that must be considered in the management of this rapidly declining species?Experiments conducted under natural and near-natural conditions in the River Dalalven, Sweden, suggest that hatchery produced trout can reproduce in the wild. In fact, when the pronounced variation between individual breeders was accounted for, there were no detectable differences between hatchery produced and wild born trout in reproductive success or offspring survival. These results were supported by molecular genetic data suggesting a pronounced gene flow from hatchery to wild trout in the river. Hatchery reared trout were, however, found to exhibit reduced survival rates immediately following release into the wild, an effect that was most likely due to phenotypic responses to the hatchery environment during ontogeny and a lack of experience of the wild.In sharp contrast to recently published studies, the present genetic analyses of European eels sampled across the whole distribution range suggest no spatial genetic structure but a subtle temporal genetic heterogeneity within sampled locations. These results emphasise the need to consider temporal replication when assessing population structure of marine species.The results obtained have general implications for the management and conservation of fish populations. First, supportive breeding of threatened salmonid populations might be successful, not only for boosting the census size and thereby reducing the short-term probability of extinction, but also for reducing the risks of inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential in future generations. However, the results also highlight the need to restore the natural productivity of a population under supportive breeding to avoid a potential reduction in fitness due to hatchery selection. Further, the lack of a detectable spatial genetic structure in the European eel suggests that the management strategy of translocating juvenile eels from locations were they are overabundant to other suitable freshwater habitats does not necessarily have to include genetic considerations with respect to the geographical origin of the translocated eels.

AB  - Routine oxygen consumption [Mo 2 ) was 35% higher in 1 day starved and 21% higher in 4 day starved adult transgenic coho salmon Oncrhynchus kisutch relative to end of migration ocean-ranched coho salmon. Critical swimming speed (U crit ) and Mo 2 at U crit (Mo 2max ) were significantly lower in 4 day starved transgenic coho salmon (1.25BL s -1 ;8.79 mg O 2 kg -1 min -1 ) compared to ocean-ranched coho salmon (1.60BL s -1 ; 9.87mgO 2 kg -1 min -1 ). Transgenic fish swam energetically less efficiently than ocean-ranched fish, as indicated by a poorer swimming economy at U crit (Mo 2max U -1 crit ). Although Mo 2max was lower in transgenic coho salmon, the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) measured during the first 20min of recovery was significantly larger in transgenic coho salmon (44.1 mgO 2 kg -1 ) compared with ocean-ranched coho salmon (34.2mg O 2 kg -1 ). which had a faster rate of recovery.

AB  - Atlantic salmon Salmo salar typically enter fresh water several months prior to spawning and just as pools can provide areas of refuge in river systems, lakes may also provide important refuge habitat during the spawning migration. Using acoustic telemetry we examined the spatial and temporal movements of wild and a ranched strain of Atlantic salmon in a freshwater lake where the main spawning areas were located upstream of the lake. Over the study period (2011-2014), returning adult wild salmon spent an average of 228 days in fresh water and 90% of that time in the lake. On entering the lake, most wild salmon moved quickly to the northern part of the lake, close to the main inflow, spending an average 76% of the time in this location. The average number of days wild fish were absent from the lake during the main spawning period varied between years, ranging from 10 to 26 days for females and 32 to 35 days for males. Seventy four per cent (17/23) of salmon spawners returned to the lake and two salmon subsequently died in the lake post-spawning. Atypically, two salmon were resident in the lake for the whole period in 2013/14. During the study, wild salmon were detected at depths within the top 5 m for 73% of the time. Median depths post-spawning were greater than in the pre-spawning period, when salmon were found to spend extensive periods at depths in excess of 10 m. In July 2013, when the lake was stratified, thermal regulation behaviour was observed in wild salmon, whereby salmon moved to cooler deeper water when water temperatures at 1 m exceeded 20°C. In contrast to wild salmon, the majority of ranch salmon returned to the traps downstream of the lake prior to the spawning period, which would be expected as they were released as smolts below the freshwater lake. Ranch fish spent an average 80% of the time in the vicinity of receivers in the south of the lake and an average 98% of the time within the top 5 m. However, two ranch females were resident in the lake until the following spring and one ranch female moved upstream into the river during the spawning period. Clearly, in this catchment the lake provides an important habitat for migrating adult salmon. In the context of climate change, where thermal and hydrological regimes in rivers are expected to change in response to changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns, the availability of deep lakes that stratify in the summer and cool water refuges in river systems is likely to play a key role in the sustenance and conservation of salmonid species. Information about the migration patterns of Atlantic salmon in undisturbed freshwater systems may also assist in resolving issues associated with fish passage in impacted rivers and inform management decisions.

AB  - The upstream migratory behaviour of wild and ranched Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in a small Irish coastal spate river was investigated using acoustic telemetry. Prespawning migratory behaviour was investigated including movement patterns at a large natural waterfall in the lower reaches of the river. A strong diurnal pattern was observed for upstream migrants at the waterfall indicative of the need for daylight to ascend this complex natural obstacle to migration. Successful passage of the waterfall was also associated with distinct environmental conditions and no difference in migratory ability was detected between wild and ranched origin S. salar. Wild S. salar tended to exhibit a non-erratic, stepwise upstream migration pattern after ascending the waterfall while ranched S. salar had an increased probability of displaying more erratic migratory behaviour. Wild S. salar penetrated further into the river catchment than ranched S. salar, although male ranched S. salar exhibited the greatest cumulative distance moved prior to the spawning period. The management implications of escaped or released ranched S. salar and movement at natural obstacles are discussed.

AB  - Acoustic telemetry has seen a rapid increase in utility and sophistication in recent years and is now used extensively to assess the behavior and survival rates of many aquatic animals, including the Atlantic salmon. As part of the salmon's complex life cycle, salmon smolts are thought to make a unidirectional migration from fresh water to the sea, which is initiated by changes in their physiology. However, some tag movement patterns do not conform with this and can be difficult to explain, particularly if the tagged fish has been eaten by a predator. This study combines the use of predator tags with machine learning techniques to understand the fate of migrating salmon smolts and thereby improve estimates for migration success. Over 3 years between 2020 and 2022, 217 salmon smolts (including wild and hatchery-reared ranched fish) were acoustically tagged and released into an embayment on the west coast of Ireland. Some tagged smolts were observed to return from the estuary back into a saline lagoon through which they had already migrated. To distinguish between the movement of a salmon smolt and that of a predator, predator tags were deployed in migrating smolts in 2021 and 2022. The addition of a temperature sensor in 2022 enabled the determination of predator type causing the returning movement. A significant number of predator tags were triggered, and the patterns of movement associated with these triggered tags were then used with two types of machine learning algorithms (hierarchical cluster analysis and random forest) to identify and validate the behavior of smolts tagged without extra sensors. Both models produced the same outputs, grouping smolts tagged with predator tags with smolts tagged without the additional sensors but showing similar movements. A mammalian predator was identified as the cause of most reversal movement, and hatchery-reared ranched smolts were found to be more likely predated upon by this predator than wild smolts within the lake and the estuary. However, overall migration success estimates were similar for both wild and hatchery-reared ranched fish. This study highlights the value of predator tags as an essential tool in the overall validation of detection data.

AB  - Few Canadian historical figures achieve the same notoriety as their American counterparts. Such is true of the 19th century Scottish-Canadian veterinarian, Dr. Duncan McNab McEachran. One of the most important pathogenic bacteria genera, Salmonella, was named for his now- immortalized American colleague, Dr. Daniel L. Salmon. Until now, McEachran had neither aggregated documentation of his work nor pathogens that share his name. In the classic style of many veterinary pathologists, Green relentlessly documents and describes McEachran’s life in this meticulously referenced book. One gets the impression that his diagnostic skills were suitably employed to research and uncover this story. There is ample use of photographs and images, which greatly complement the text. This book has broad appeal to anyone interested in veterinary medicine or Canadian history. The important role McEachran played in the history of veterinary medicine cannot be overstated. As Canada’s first Chief Veterinarian, he pioneered a world-renowned regulatory veterinary medicine system, initiated Canada’s livestock importation and quarantine structure, and excluded important foreign animal diseases. He established a veterinary school, ran a successful private practice, and worked with notable colleagues including William Osler, together identifying the dog lungworm (Oslerus osleri). In addition to veterinary medicine, McEachran bred horses and ranched cattle. As a businessperson and manager, the stories of McEachran’s involvement with some early western Canadian ranches offer a unique perspective. This book goes beyond a biography by painting a vivid historical picture of early Canada through the lens of veterinary medicine and suggests that perhaps there are many such amazing characters in Canadian history whose exploits remain undocumented. Given the breadth of McEachran’s fascinating activities, one wonders how he fit it all in! Surely this feisty Scotsman was no slouch and maybe someday soon, an important pathogen will bear his name.

AB  -  OHQ vol. 112, no. 2 Where the Crooked River Rises: A High Desert Home by Ellen Waterston Oregon State University Press, Corvallis, 2010. Photographs, 144 pages. $18.95 paper. From Sarah Winnemucca to Julia Gillis, Dorothy Lawson McCall to C.E.S. Wood, Ada Hastings Hedges to Jarold Ramsey, and William Kittredge to Eileen McVicker, Oregon’s high desert has inspired nearly 150 years of literary revelation. With this fourth book, Ellen Waterston adds to those revelations. Nine published and seven unpublished works predominate—non-fictionessaysthatcanmix autobiography, biography, history, anecdote, journalism, and folklore. Three pieces derive fromWaterston’s acclaimed 2003 memoir Then There Was No Mountain: A Parallel Odyssey of a Mother and Daughter through Addiction (Rowman Littlefield). Two poems and at least nine photographers enhance the work with twenty-six black-and-white photographs — four by Waterston herself. Where the Crooked River Rises seems grounded in two personal epochs. New England native, 1968 Harvard B.A., University of Madagascar M.A.,stringer for Time,Waterston was suitably married to Samuel J. Bartow. As readers of Then ThereWas No Mountain know, the newlyweds first ranched in Montana, then came to Oregon in 1973 and bought a remote spread on the Crooked River. For seventeen years, the couple ranched. While raising three children, Waterston learned to love the desert, but Bartow became a drug addict. Their paradise became hell.In 1985,Ellen Bartow and her three young children evacuated “our desert ranch to town in the family station wagon” (Then There Was No Mountain, xiii). Single mother and divorced, Bartow adopted her maiden name again. As Ellen Waterston,she found refuge in booming Bend, where she became a successful strategic planner and communications specialist. As journalist, writer,and poet,she founded a literary retreat, published her 2003 memoir, and won the 2005 national WILLA award in poetry for I Am Madagascar (2004). Since 2005, she has been the impresario of The Nature of Words, an ambitious and successful literary organization. Among her recent honors is a second WILLA award for Between Desert Seasons (2009,Wordcraft of Oregon). Many of these essays tacitly contrast those two personal epochs. In “PauMau,” she celebrates ranch women at their Christmas party, then in “What One Thing,” she describes a Bend dinner party of new peers — non-profit schmoozers and shakers. In“That’s Deep,”she describes“Jack,”a nonagerian rancher and his “settin in the saddle” theories (p. 48). “Main Thing,” in contrast, sketches the urban advocacy of Don Kerr, founder of the High Desert Museum, and documents his theory: we must shift from“user to steward or all will be lost”(p. 63).In“TwoAlices,”Waterston describes homesteaderAlice Day Pratt (1872–1963) and rancher Alice DeLore. Sketching those single women living alone,Waterston explores the differences between her own flight and those who refused to marry or leave. Her poems continue these tacit contrasts: in 2000, she published “Trapping Coyotes,”a folkloristic monologue of Van Houston, a character documented during her ranching past in Then ThereWas No Mountain; in 2005,Waterston was commissioned to write and perform “Take a River,” a pop history of Bend, for the city centennial. Finally, she contrasts her “homes.” In “The Old Hackleman Place . . .” she “takes a sentimental journey . . . to that beloved, dusty ranch where I once lived . . . as a newlywed, carried three children, raised a family,and watched a husband become invisible to himself . . .”(p.29–30).In“Looking Up to Low,”she describes her new urban home “on the banks of the Deschutes River as it flows throughdowntownBend”andfifty-somepages later mentions her failing second marriage to David Bong (p. 67). Some readers may find Waterston unreliable : in “Cows Kill Salmon,” “Last Log,” and  Book Notes “Morally Certain,” the author avoids stating how and why capitalism degrades and dest oys ecosystems,begins and ends industries,attracts and subjugates populations.Other readers may want fewer inaccuracies, more credits, and larger, sharper photographs. Nevertheless, Waterston delivers: perched on an empty barn wall, coiled riata in hand, black Stetson on her head, she stares out — rider ready for whatever revelation comes next. Sometime she lives in hard country, sometimes she lives in boom town. Winnemucca to McVicker, her desert ancestors understand...

AB  - The Wilderness Himter.Some distance beyond the Mississippi, stretching from Texas to North Dakota, and westward to the Rocky- Mountains, lies the plains country.This is a region of light rainfall, where the ground is clad with short grass, while Cottonwood trees fringe the courses of the winding plains streams ; streams that are alternately turbid torrents and mere dwindling threads of water.The great stretches of natural pasture are broken by gray sage-brush plains, and tracts of strangely shaped and colored Bad Lands ; sun-scorched wastes in summer, and in winter arctic in their iron desolation.Beyond the plains rise the Rocky Mountains, their flanks covered with coniferous woods ; but the trees are small, and do not ordinarily grow very closely together.Towards the north the forest becomes denser, and the peaks higher ; and glaciers creep down towards the valleys from the fields of everlasting snow.The brooks are brawling, trout-filled torrents ; the swift rivers foam over rapid and cataract, on their way to one or the other of the two great oceans.Southwest of the Rockies evil and terrible deserts stretch for leagues and leagues, mere waterless wastes of sandy plain and barren mountain, broken here and there by narrow strips of fertile ground.Rain rarely falls, and there are no clouds to dim the brazen sun.The rivers run in deep canyons, or are swallowed by the burning sand ; the smaller watercourses are dry throughout the greater part of the year.Beyond this desert region rise the sunny Sierras of California, with their flower-clad slopes and groves of giant trees ; and north of them, along the coast, the rain-The Avierican Wilderfiess.3 shrouded mountain chains of Oregon and Washington, matted with the towering growth of the mighty evergreen forest.The white hunters, who from time to time first pene- trated the different parts of this wilderness, found themselves in such hunting grounds as those wherein, long ages before, their Old-World forefathers had dwelt ; and the game they chased was much the same as that their lusty barbarian ancestors followed, with weapons of bronze and of iron, in the dim years before history dawned.As late as the end of the seventeenth century the tur- bulent village nobles of Lithuania and Livonia hunted the bear, the bison, the elk, the wolf, and the stag, and hung the spoils in their smoky wooden palaces ; and so, two hundred years later, the free hunters of Montana, in the interludes between hazardous mining quests and bloody Indian campaigns, hunted game almost or quite the same in kind, through the cold mountain forests surrounding the Yellowstone and Flathead lakes, and decked their log cabins and ranch houses with the hides and horns of the slaughtered beasts.Zoologically speaking, the north temperate zones of the Old and New Worlds are very similar, differing from one another much less than they do from the various regions south of them, or than these regions differ among themselves.The untrodden American wilderness resem- bles both in game and physical character .theforests, the mountains, and the steppes of the Old World as it was at the beginning of our era.Great woods of pine and fir, birch and beech, oak and chestnut ; streams where the 4 Tlie Wilderness H^mter.chief game fish are spotted trout and silvery salmon ; grouse of various kinds as the most common game birds ; all these the hunter finds as characteristic of the New World as of the Old.So it is with most of the beasts of the chase, and so also with the fur-bearing animals that furnish to the trapper alike his life work and his means of livelihood.The bear, wolf
