AB  - This chapter starts by providing a review of what aquaculture is, which finfish are farmed, for what purposes and in what kinds of culture systems. It then considers what behaviour is, why biologists are interested in behaviour and how they study and explain it. The question of the complexity of fish behaviour is addressed, leading into a discussion of fish welfare and how it can be defined, identified and measured. The issues of domestication, selective breeding and the extent to which fish are domesticated animals are then covered, as are the effects of captive rearing; in both cases, effects on behaviour are given special consideration. The criteria for effective, sustainable fish culture are then spelled out; these include efficient production, environmental protection (with respect to land, water and feed resources and to impacts on wild fish populations) and fish welfare. Possible strategies for improving the welfare of farmed fish are discussed and consideration given to what is required of the behaviour of fish cultured for food, for science and the ornamental trade and for release. Finally, an outline is given of the structure and content of the remaining 10 chapters of this book.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Entering the knowledge society and mobilizing science and technology are critical for emerging countries (ECs) to address important challenges of society and promote long‐term economic growth. Natural laboratories (NLs) are geographical or geophysical singularities that provide comparative advantages and leverage to ECs for scientific research and international collaboration. Based on empirical evidence and learning experiences from five NLs in Chile, we propose the foundations of a conceptual framework for public scientific policies based on NLs and their possible implementation in ECs. Scientific research in NLs may address local, national, and global societal challenges while decentralizing scientific activities, encouraging transdisciplinary research in territories, anticipating the effects of climate change, and protecting biodiversity while promoting international partnerships and alignment with 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>

AB  - Cell-cultivated meat and seafood is getting closer to a reality for consumers in the US and around the world. However, regulators are still largely lagging behind on regulating production and labelling of these products. In a large experimental study using a representative US sample (N = 2653), we tested 9 different names for 3 different types of meat and seafood products in terms of their clarity, consumer appeal, and communication of safety and allergenicity. We found that terms proposed by the conventional meat and seafood industry including 'artificial' and 'lab-grown' tended to score low in terms of consumer appeal, purchase intent, and perceived safety, while 'artificial' also had the lowest score on clarity and communicating allergenicity. On the other hand, terms proposed by the cell-cultivated industry including 'Novari' scored high in terms of appeal and purchase intent but scored low in terms of clarity. The terms 'cell-cultured' and 'cell-cultivated' were the best all round labels in terms of clarity, appeal, and communicating safety and allergenicity - in particular, the addition of the prefix 'cell-' increased understanding compared to 'cultured' or 'cultivated' labels. The most-understood label was a short descriptive phrase ('grown from [animal] cells, not farmed [or fished]'), suggesting that additional wording on packaging could aid consumer understanding in this early stage. A high proportion of consumers were uncertain about the allergen status of cell-cultivated products under all names, suggesting that cell-cultivated products should be labelled as the type of meat they are, and carry applicable allergen information.

AB  - AbstractSpring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are particularly vulnerable to climate change because adults over-summer in freshwater streams before spawning in autumn. We examined streamflow and water temperature regimes that could lead to long-term reductions in spring-run Chinook salmon (SRCS) in a California stream and evaluated management adaptations to ameliorate these impacts. Bias-corrected and spatially downscaled climate data from six general circulation models and two emission scenarios for the period 2010–2099 were used as input to two linked models: a water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model to simulate weekly mean streamflow and water temperature in Butte Creek, California that were used as input to SALMOD, a spatially explicit and size/stage structured model of salmon population dynamics in freshwater systems. For all climate scenarios and model combinations, WEAP yielded lower summer base flows and higher water temperatures relative to historical conditions, while SALMOD yi...

AB  - In the last three decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a 527% growth, producing 82 million tons for a first sale value estimated at 250 billion USD. Infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites are the major causes of mortality and economic losses in commercial aquaculture. Some pathologies, especially those of bacterial origin, can be treated with commercially available drugs, while others are poorly managed. In fact, despite having been recognized as a useful preventive measure, no effective vaccination against many economically relevant diseases exist yet, such as for viral and parasitic infections. The objective of the present review is to provide the reader with an updated perspective on the most significant and innovative vaccine research on three key aquaculture commodities. European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were chosen because of their economic relevance, geographical distinctiveness, and representativeness of different culture systems. Scientific papers about vaccines against bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases will be objectively presented; their results critically discussed and compared; and suggestions for future directions given.

          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">In 82 multidrug resistant bacterial isolates, the prevalence of both the conserved elements of the integrons, qacEΔ1 and sul1 genes, and the variable region (VR) was determined. Further, whole genome sequencing and complete genetic analysis was performed in VR-positive isolates.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Despite the fact that 100% of the bacterial isolates presented the intI1 gene, only 12.3% carried the qacEΔ1 and sul1 genes and only two (2.4%) presented a VR with gene cassettes. In the Pseudomonas baetica 25P2F9 isolate, a VR carrying aac(6')31, qacH, and bla<sub>OXA-2</sub> gene cassettes was described, whereas the VR of Aeromonas salmonicida 30PB8 isolate showed a dfrA14 gene cassette. The array of gene cassettes found in the Pseudomonas isolate appears with high frequency in clinically relevant pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. Additionally, it was possible to determine that these integrons are contained in plasmids and coul be easily transferred. Resistome analysis demonstrated that both isolates carried a great diversity of antibiotic resistance genes, including many β-lactamases. Even in the Aeromonas isolate a new oxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was described (bla<sub>OXA-956</sub>).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">The presence of multidrug resistant bacteria and clinically relevant genetic elements in the salmon intestinal microbiota make the aquaculture a hotspot in the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance; therefore, the control of antibiotics used in this activity is a key point to avoid its escalation.</AbstractText>

AB  - Chilean Patagonia boasts 100,627 km of coastline, including approximately 40,050 islands and numerous fjords and channels, which generate a high degree of geomorphological and hydrographic complexity and make it one of the largest mega-estuarine environments on Earth. These characteristics, among others, generate structurally and functionally unique marine ecosystems, as well as biodiversity hotspots. In this chapter we perform a comprehensive literature review and highlight the use of marine mammals and seabirds as focal species to guide conservation initiatives aimed at minimizing anthropogenic impacts as well as safeguarding the ecosystem integrity of Patagonia as a climate refuge. Given their characteristics as ecologically relevant umbrella, indicator, and sentinel species, we suggest that focal species are highly useful in guiding the prioritization of management and conservation initiatives to achieve world-class conservation standards in Chilean Patagonia.

AB  - The resilience of coastal social-ecological systems may depend on adaptive responses to aquaculture disease outbreaks that can threaten wild and farm fish. A nine-year study of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from Pacific Canada indicates that adaptive changes in parasite management on salmon farms have yielded positive conservation outcomes. After four years of sea lice epizootics and wild salmon population decline, parasiticide application on salmon farms was adapted to the timing of wild salmon migrations. Winter treatment of farm fish with parasiticides, prior to the out-migration of wild juvenile salmon, has reduced epizootics of wild salmon without significantly increasing the annual number of treatments. Levels of parasites on wild juvenile salmon significantly influence the growth rate of affected salmon populations, suggesting that these changes in management have had positive outcomes for wild salmon populations. These adaptive changes have not occurred through formal adaptive management, but rather, through multi-stakeholder processes arising from a contentious scientific and public debate. Despite the apparent success of parasite control on salmon farms in the study region, there remain concerns about the long-term sustainability of this approach because of the unknown ecological effects of parasticides and the potential for parasite resistance to chemical treatments.

AB  - The diversity of nanotechnologies and of the governance challenges that their applications raise calls for exploration and learning across different cases. We present an Upstream Oversight Assessment (UOA) of expected benefits and potential harms of nanoparticles made of a synthetic polymer (PLGA) to improve vaccines for farmed salmon. Suggested by Jennifer Kuzma and colleagues, an UOA may help identify and prioritise research needs, and it may support evaluations of the adequacy of relevant existing regulatory frameworks. In this work, the UOA approach is modified and supported with elements from the uncertainty analysis framework developed by Warren Walker and colleagues. Empirically, we draw on relevant available published literature and insights generated in an ongoing nanoparticle salmon vaccine project, in which one of the authors participates. Nanotechnologies have not previously been encountered in the regulatory context of fish vaccines, which in part raises unique challenges due to prospective large scale vaccine use in semi-open aquatic systems. Strengthened through cooperation between ELSA and technology researchers we found the UOA useful for an early mapping of benefits and concerns, and for identifying areas in need of further research prior to a nanoparticle based salmon vaccine is developed and taken into use. We consider our approach to represent one among several complementing initiatives that seek to contribute to early stage evaluations of possible negative side effects, broadly conceived, in order to facilitate a more robust nanotechnology development.

AB  - Artificial propagation programs focused on production, such as commercial aquaculture or forestry, entail strong domestication selection. Spillover from such programs can cause unintended fitness and demographic consequences for wild conspecifics. The range of possible management practices to minimize such consequences vary in their control of genetic and demographic processes. Here, we use a model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics to evaluate alternative management approaches to minimizing unintended consequences of aquaculture escapees. We find that, if strong natural selection occurs between escape and reproduction, an extremely maladapted (i.e., nonlocal-origin, highly domesticated) stock could have fitness consequences analogous to a weakly diverged cultured stock; otherwise, wild population fitness declines with increasing maladaptation in the cultured stock. Reducing escapees through low-level leakage is more effective than reducing an analogous number of escapees from large, rare pulses. This result arises because low-level leakage leads to the continual lowering of wild population fitness and subsequent increased proportional contribution of maladapted cultured escapees to the total population. Increased sterilization efficacy can cause rapid, nonlinear reductions in unintended fitness consequences. Finally, sensitivity to the stage of escape indicates a need for improved monitoring data on how the number of escapees varies across life cycle stages.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that a switch in diet might cause changes in the abundance and composition of mucous-dwelling microorganisms, a short-term experiment was conducted with Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Fish were fed on three different diets: pelleted S. salar feed, macroinvertebrates or pellets supplemented with an antibiotic. A fourth group of fish was deprived of food throughout the trial. Seven days after manipulating diets, significant differences were found in microbial density and community composition (quantified by different morphologically distinct colonies), particularly between fed and unfed animals. Moreover, food deprivation caused a rapid decrease in the number of epidermal mucous cells of the lateral skin, which may indicate a decrease in mucous secretion and explain differences in the diversity of mucous-dwelling microbiota observed in the fish. This is the first report of an effect of feeding regime on the abundance of microbial communities associated with cutaneous mucus of fishes.

AB  - An experimental contraceptive vaccine was evaluated in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A peptide derived from the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (LH) was conjugated to two different carrier proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and formulated with one of four immunostimulants in a water-in-oil emulsion. Specific antibody responses to the peptide and each carrier protein were evaluated. While the antibody response to KLH was stronger than the response to BSA, both carrier proteins stimulated comparable antibody responses to the LH peptide. The immunostimulant proved to be more important for enhancing the LH peptide antibody response than the carrier protein selection; vaccines containing a combination of Aeromonas salmonicida and Vibrio anguillarum stimulated significantly greater LH peptide antibody production than any of the other three immunostimulants evaluated at 12 weeks post-vaccination. This study provides proof-of-concept for specific antibody production against a hapten-carrier protein antigen in Atlantic salmon and reinforces the importance of vaccine immunostimulant selection.

AB  - Mean trophic level (MTL) of landings and primary production required (PPR) by fisheries are increasingly used in the assessment of sustainability in fisheries. However, in their present form, MTL and PPR are prone to misinterpretation. We show that it is important to account for actual catch data, define an appropriate historical and spatial domain, and carefully consider the effects of fisheries management, based on results from a case study of Swedish fisheries during the past century.

AB  - Although there is a growing body of literature on the environmental impacts of food, virtually none of the studies has addressed baby foods. Therefore, this work explored the life cycle environmental impacts of different ready-made baby foods, both at the level of individual meals and their combinations within a weekly menu. Twelve different meals were considered, based on baby food products available on the UK market, spanning breakfast, lunch and dessert. Menus following four different diets - omnivorous, vegetarian, pescatarian and dairy-free - were also evaluated. The results showed that, on average, lunch meals had the highest impacts and desserts the lowest. Breakfast has either intermediate (wet porridge) or low (dry porridge) impacts. Among the lunch meals, spaghetti Bolognese and salmon risotto had the highest impacts and among the desserts, strawberry, raspberry and banana as well as apple, pear and banana purees had the lowest. The key hotspots across the meals were raw materials and packaging. Meals with more meat and cream were found to have higher impacts. Manufacturing also played a significant role for global warming potential as well as depletion of fossil resources and the ozone layer due to the fossil fuels used in the process. When the impacts were analysed per mass of baby food consumed weekly, the dairy-free diet had higher impacts than the other three, but the difference among them was relatively small. The trends changed when nutritional value was taken into account, with the dairy-free diet exhibiting considerably higher impacts per unit of energy content. In that case, the pescatarian diet became the best option for most impacts. There was little difference between the omnivore and vegetarian diets. It is expected that these results will be of interest to baby food manufacturers and consumers, helping them to make more informed manufacturing and purchasing decisions.

AB  - Abstract The salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture industry has used various practices to treat salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infections, including mechanical, thermal, and chemical treatments. However, due to the environmental and fish welfare issues, and limitations associated with these practices, the use of cleaner fish has become a popular complementary delousing method. The goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) is the smallest among the delousing species used, which makes it most susceptible to escape through the salmon cage netting. Escape of goldsinny wrasse into the wild would lead to additional costs for farmers and could spread diseases and genetically contaminate wild stocks, as these cleaner fish are often transported over large distances from the capture site to the aquaculture site. The Norwegian aquaculture industry sets the goldsinny wrasse minimum size for use with different salmon cage mesh sizes using guidelines based on simple penetration tests that do not consider the potential compressibility of fish or changes in mesh state due to factors such as sea conditions and maintenance operations. Using morphological measurements of 100 fish, results of 47,800 penetration tests, and computer simulation, we predicted the minimum sizes required to avoid escape of goldsinny wrasse through and array of salmon farm nets. Our results show that the minimum stocking sizes for goldsinny wrasse in the current guidelines used by the industry may pose escape risk. Further, our findings illustrate the importance of considering fish compressibility and mesh state when estimating the fish minimum sizes required to avoid escape via cage netting mesh penetration. Finally, the results presented here provide the salmon farming industry with new guidelines that will contribute to reducing goldsinny wrasse escape from the cages and ultimately lessen the potential environmental consequences of such escape. For the two most typical mesh-size used by the aquaculture industry in Norway i.e. 30 and 50 mm and under the worst-case scenario i.e. slack state, the minimum recommended lengths for goldsinny wrasse would be ~128 (~28) and ~ 206 mm (~123 g). These sizes represent an underestimation of 16 and 24% in the sizes of goldsinny wrasse necessary to avoid escape compared to the current guidelines based on stiff meshes.

1
Catches of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. decreased in the 1980s and 1990s over its entire area in the North Atlantic and smolts were often released for stock enhancement. However, there are questions about their survival and performance relative to fully wild fish. This paper reports on the survival and sea growth of River Imsa salmon released from 1981 to 1999 as 1- and 2-year-old hatchery and wild smolts.

2
Survival was significantly higher for wild than hatchery fish. Hatchery salmon released as 2-year-old smolts had lower survival, were captured more in coastal than freshwaters, grew more slowly and attained maturity younger than corresponding 1-year-old smolts.

3
The survival rate of hatchery fish released as 2-year-old smolts, but not 1-year-olds and wild smolts, decreased during the 1980s and 1990s. Growth rates at sea, adult size and the proportion of multi-sea-winter fish of all three groups also decreased over time.

4
Catches in coastal relative to freshwaters were higher for two- than one-sea-winter fish. Salmon captured in coastal water were greater in length than those captured in rivers. Mean specific growth rate at sea was similar for wild and hatchery salmon released as 1-year-old smolts, and higher than in hatchery fish released as 2-year-olds.

5
The proportion of two-sea-winter salmon correlated positively with the specific growth rate in the first year at sea. Total capture of wild adult salmon in rivers and Norwegian home waters each year correlated positively with the specific growth rate in the first year at sea. The same correlation held for hatchery fish released as 2- but not 1-year-old smolts.

6
Synthesis and applications. The coastal fishery was size-selective in reducing the size and age of salmon. Releases of 1-year-old smolts were financially more profitable than those of 2-year-olds. Decreasing production of River Imsa salmon since 1981 was chiefly caused by reduced sea-age at maturity and growth rate at sea of both hatchery and wild fish. A counteracting measure would be to reduce the size selectivity of the salmon fisheries.

AB  - Domesticated species continually escaping and interbreeding with wild relatives impose a migration load on wild populations. As domesticated stocks become increasingly different as a result of artificial and natural selection in captivity, fitness of escapees in the wild is expected to decline, reducing the effective rate of migration into wild populations. Recent theory suggest that this may alleviate and eventually eliminate the resulting migration load. I develop a multivariate model of trait and wild fitness evolution resulting from the joint effects of artificial and natural selection in the captive environment. Initially, the evolutionary trajectory is dominated by the effects of artificial selection causing a fast initial decline in fitness of escapees in the wild. In later phases, through the counteracting effects of correlational multivariate natural selection in captivity, the mean phenotype is pushed in directions of weak stabilizing selection, allowing a sustained response in the trait subject to artificial selection. Provided that there is some alignment between the adaptive landscapes in the wild and in captivity, these phases are associated with slower rates of decline in wild fitness of the domesticated stock, suggesting that detrimental effects on wild populations are likely to remain a concern in the foreseeable future.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HAB) are recurrent phenomena in northern Europe along the coasts of the Baltic Sea, Kattegat-Skagerrak, eastern North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. These HABs have caused occasional massive losses for the aquaculture industry and have chronically affected socioeconomic interests in several ways. This status review gives an overview of historical HAB events and summarises reports to the Harmful Algae Event Database from 1986 to the end of year 2019 and observations made in long term monitoring programmes of potentially harmful phytoplankton and of phycotoxins in bivalve shellfish. Major HAB taxa causing fish mortalities in the region include blooms of the prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina leadbeateri in northern Norway in 1991 and 2019, resulting in huge economic losses for fish farmers. A bloom of the prymesiophyte Prymnesium polylepis (syn. Chrysochromulina polylepis) in the Kattegat-Skagerrak in 1988 was ecosystem disruptive. Blooms of the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis spp. have caused accumulations of foam on beaches in the southwestern North Sea and Wadden Sea coasts and shellfish mortality has been linked to their occurrence. Mortality of shellfish linked to HAB events has been observed in estuarine waters associated with influx of water from the southern North Sea. The first bloom of the dictyochophyte genus Pseudochattonella was observed in 1998, and since then such blooms have been observed in high cell densities in spring causing fish mortalities some years. Dinoflagellates, primarily Dinophysis spp., intermittently yield concentrations of Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DST) in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, above regulatory limits along the coasts of Norway, Denmark and the Swedish west coast. On average, DST levels in shellfish have decreased along the Swedish and Norwegian Skagerrak coasts since approximately 2006, coinciding with a decrease in the cell abundance of D. acuta. Among dinoflagellates, Alexandrium species are the major source of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST) in the region. PST concentrations above regulatory levels were rare in the Skagerrak-Kattegat during the three decadal review period, but frequent and often abundant findings of Alexandrium resting cysts in surface sediments indicate a high potential risk for blooms. PST levels often above regulatory limits along the west coast of Norway are associated with A. catenella (ribotype Group 1) as the main toxin producer. Other Alexandrium species, such as A. ostenfeldii and A. minutum, are capable of producing PST among some populations but are usually not associated with PSP events in the region. The cell abundance of A. pseudogonyaulax, a producer of the ichthyotoxin goniodomin (GD), has increased in the Skagerrak-Kattegat since 2010, and may constitute an emerging threat. The dinoflagellate Azadinium spp. have been unequivocally linked to the presence of azaspiracid toxins (AZT) responsible for Azaspiracid Shellfish Poisoning (AZP) in northern Europe. These toxins were detected in bivalve shellfish at concentrations above regulatory limits for the first time in Norway in blue mussels in 2005 and in Sweden in blue mussels and oysters (Ostrea edulis and Crassostrea gigas) in 2018. Certain members of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia produce the neurotoxin domoic acid and analogs known as Amnesic Shellfish Toxins (AST). Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia were common in the North Sea and the Skagerrak-Kattegat, but levels of AST in bivalve shellfish were rarely above regulatory limits during the review period. Summer cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea are a concern mainly for tourism by causing massive fouling of bathing water and beaches. Some of the cyanobacteria produce toxins, e.g. Nodularia spumigena, producer of nodularin, which may be a human health problem and cause occasional dog mortalities. Coastal and shelf sea regions in northern Europe provide a key supply of seafood, socioeconomic well-being and ecosystem services. Increasing anthropogenic influence and climate change create environmental stressors causing shifts in the biogeography and intensity of HABs. Continued monitoring of HAB and phycotoxins and the operation of historical databases such as HAEDAT provide not only an ongoing status report but also provide a way to interpret causes and mechanisms of HABs.

AB  - We investigated aquaculture production of Asian tiger shrimp, whiteleg shrimp, giant river prawn, tilapia, and pangasius catfish in Bangladesh, China, Thailand, and Vietnam by using life cycle assessments (LCAs), with the purpose of evaluating the comparative eco-efficiency of producing different aquatic food products. Our starting hypothesis was that different production systems are associated with significantly different environmental impacts, as the production of these aquatic species differs in intensity and management practices. In order to test this hypothesis, we estimated each system's global warming, eutrophication, and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts. The contribution to these impacts and the overall dispersions relative to results were propagated by Monte Carlo simulations and dependent sampling. Paired testing showed significant (p < 0.05) differences between the median impacts of most production systems in the intraspecies comparisons, even after a Bonferroni correction. For the full distributions instead of only the median, only for Asian tiger shrimp did more than 95% of the propagated Monte Carlo results favor certain farming systems. The major environmental hot-spots driving the differences in environmental performance among systems were fishmeal from mixed fisheries for global warming, pond runoff and sediment discards for eutrophication, and agricultural pesticides, metals, benzalkonium chloride, and other chlorine-releasing compounds for freshwater ecotoxicity. The Asian aquaculture industry should therefore strive toward farming systems relying upon pelleted species-specific feeds, where the fishmeal inclusion is limited and sourced sustainably. Also, excessive nutrients should be recycled in integrated organic agriculture together with efficient aeration solutions powered by renewable energy sources.

AB  - <jats:p>The study presents the development of a biosafety system in aquaculture activities on the territory of the Murmansk region, accounting for the existing scientific developments and recommendations. The authors’ scientific and practical experience in cultivating the hydrobionts in the conditions of the Polar region is the core of the study. The materials for the development of the regional biosafety program of salmon cages farms were the longstanding epizootic and ichthiopathological studies of the department of fish physiology and diseases, aquaculture objects of the Murmansk Regional Animal Disease Control Center (2013–2019). The most significant risks for salmon net farms of the Murmansk region are: carrying out activities in the zone of risky fish farming; lack (or scarcity) of high-quality nursery material of domestic origin, absence of the center for research and prevention of fish diseases; the absence of the specialized enterprise for aquaculture waste disposal. The developed system of practical safety of aquaculture enterprises in the region will allow managing the risks through certain efforts and events. The principles of biosafety system development in accordance with the environmental requirements and associated conditions for maintaining the epizootic and ichthyopathological safety in the commercial cultivation of fish are considered. Preventive measures to maintain epizootic safety in fish farms have been developed. Suggestions and recommendations are formulated to conduct safe aquaculture activities in the conditions of the Murmansk region. A integrated approach to biosafety through certain risk management activities is aimed at solving the problems of preserving the health of cultivated objects resulting in the maximal feasibility of the enterprise and maintaining the biodiversity of natural communities and environmental sustainability in the region.</jats:p>

AB  - Summary
Greenhouse gas emissions caused by food production are receiving increased attention worldwide. A problem with many studies is that they only consider one product; methodological differences also make it difficult to compare results across studies. Using a consistent methodology to ensure comparability, we quantified the carbon footprint of more than 20 Norwegian seafood products, including fresh and frozen, processed and unprocessed cod, haddock, saithe, herring, mackerel, farmed salmon, and farmed blue mussels. The previous finding that fuel use in fishing and feed production in aquaculture are key inputs was confirmed. Additional key aspects identified were refrigerants used on fishing vessels, product yield, and by-product use. Results also include that product form (fresh or frozen) only matters when freezing makes slower transportation possible. Processing before export was favorable due to the greater potential to use by-products and the reduced need for transportation. The most efficient seafood product was herring shipped frozen in bulk to Moscow at 0.7 kilograms CO2 equivalents per kilogram (kg CO2-eq/kg) edible product. At the other end we found fresh gutted salmon airfreighted to Tokyo at 14 kg CO2-eq/kg edible product. This wide range points to major differences between seafood products and room for considerable improvement within supply chains and in product choices. In fisheries, we found considerable variability between fishing methods used to land the same species, which indicates the importance of fisheries management favoring the most resource-efficient ways of fishing. Both production and consumption patterns matter, and a range of improvements could benefit the carbon performance of Norwegian seafood products.

AB  - Rural ambulances are now normally crewed by paramedics who are well trained in pre-hospital care. Although the injuries sustained in rural road traffic accidents are similar to those sustained in towns, access can be restricted by narrow roads, and definitive treatment may be delayed because of the distance to hospital. Fish farming, a relatively new rural industry, has its own occupational health problems. Many GPs will have spent 6 months or more working in an accident and emergency department as part of their vocational training for general practice. Make sure the patient's airway is patent and secure. If there is any possibility of neck injury, the cervical spine should be stabilised manually, then secured by a rigid cervical collar and neck blocks on a spinal board. A cardiac monitor can make management of ill patients much easier. Thrombolytic or 'clotbuster' therapy administered within 12 hours of the onset of a myocardial infarction significantly reduces the risk of the patient dying.

AB  - The salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is an ectoparasite of salmonids that causes huge economic losses in salmon farming, and has also been causatively linked with declines of wild salmonid populations. Lice control on farms is reliant upon a few groups of pesticides that have all shown time-limited efficiency due to resistance development. However, to date, this example of human-induced evolution is poorly documented at the population level due to the lack of molecular tools. As such, important evolutionary and management questions, linked to the development and dispersal of pesticide resistance in this parasite, remain unanswered. Here, we introduce the first Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array for the salmon louse, which includes 6000 markers, and present a population genomic scan using this array on 576 lice from twelve farms distributed across the North Atlantic. Our results support the hypothesis of a single panmictic population of lice in the Atlantic, and importantly, revealed very strong selective sweeps on linkage groups 1 and 5. These sweeps included candidate genes potentially connected to pesticide resistance. After genotyping a further 576 lice from 12 full sibling families, a genome-wide association analysis established a highly significant association between the major sweep on linkage group 5 and resistance to emamectin benzoate, the most widely used pesticide in salmonid aquaculture for more than a decade. The analysis of conserved haplotypes across samples from the Atlantic strongly suggests that emamectin benzoate resistance developed at a single source, and rapidly spread across the Atlantic within the period 1999 when the chemical was first introduced, to 2010 when samples for the present study were obtained. These results provide unique insights into the development and spread of pesticide resistance in the marine environment, and identify a small genomic region strongly linked to emamectin benzoate resistance. Finally, these results have highly significant implications for the way pesticide resistance is considered and managed within the aquaculture industry.

AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The marine aquaculture industry and regulators are in the process of implementing environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of microbial communities for compliance monitoring. This requires standardization of sampling, laboratory, and data analysis protocols. Towards this goal, we in this study completed two further milestones using samples collected from two Scottish salmon farms: (i) We tested the effect of using two different PCR protocols (i.e., different DNA polymerases, master mixes, and annealing temperatures), which are frequently being used in eDNA biomonitoring of aquaculture installations, for the amplification of the taxonomic marker gene (V3‐V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene). (ii) We quantified sampling background noise obtained from eDNA samples and statistically compared results with the sampling bias observed in macrofaunal samples from the same source sediments. We detected differences in bacterial community structures resulting from the performance of different PCR protocols, profoundly influencing the interpretation of biomonitoring results. Furthermore, we found that sampling‐induced errors for eDNA samples were similar to errors for macrofaunal samples collected according to compliance monitoring protocol (~25% variability in both cases). Finally, we showed that within‐grab variances of microbial community structures were in the same order of magnitude (less than 10× difference in all cases) as the one obtained from replicate grabs collected from the same locale (impact category). Based on our findings, we suggest using a consistent PCR protocol for biomonitoring efforts to improve the comparability of results, especially when different service providers are conducting the biomonitoring. We propose a sampling scheme to be considered in eDNA biomonitoring that includes taking three replicate grabs at each locale, with one replicate sample from each grab. This minimizes sampling‐induced errors and makes upcoming eDNA‐based monitoring results comparable with previous compliance monitoring results obtained from macrofaunal data.</jats:p>

AB  - The introduction of non-native species into new habitats poses a major threat to native populations. Of particular interest, though often overlooked, are introductions of populations that are not fully reproductively isolated from native individuals and can hybridize with them. To address this important topic we used different approaches in a multi-pronged study, combining the effects of mate choice, shoaling behaviour and genetics. Here we present evidence that behavioural traits such as shoaling and mate choice can promote population mixing if individuals do not distinguish between native and foreign conspecifics. We examined this in the context of two guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations that have been subject to an introduction and subsequent population mixing event in Trinidad. The introduction of Guanapo River guppies into the Turure River more than 50 years ago led to a marked reduction of the original genotype. In our experiments, female guppies did not distinguish between shoaling partners when given the choice between native and foreign individuals. Introduced fish are therefore likely to benefit from the protection of a shoal and will improve their survival chances as a result. The additional finding that male guppies do not discriminate between females on the basis of origin will further increase the process of population mixing, especially if males encounter mixed shoals. In a mesocosm experiment, in which the native and foreign populations were allowed to mate freely, we found, as expected on the basis of these behavioural interactions, that the distribution of offspring genotypes could be predicted from the proportions of the two types of founding fish. This result suggests that stochastic and environmental processes have reinforced the biological ones to bring about the genetic dominance of the invading population in the Turure River. Re-sampling the Turure for genetic analysis using SNP markers confirmed the population mixing process and showed that it is an on-going process in this river and has led to the nearly complete disappearance of the original genotype.

AB  - Alternative reproductive phenotypes represent adaptive life-history responses to local environments. Hybridization with domesticated conspecifics exposed to selection against one of the phenotypes could affect the plasticity and incidence of alternative reproductive phenotypes within wild populations, potentially influencing individual fitness and population viability. We addressed this hypothesis by undertaking a common-garden experiment on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a species in which males mature either as large, migratory anadromous individuals or as small, generally nonmigratory parr. Comparing one wild population and two domesticated–wild hybrids (F1, wild backcrosses), we evaluated the incidence of parr maturity at three different temperatures. Parr maturation probability exhibited a significant quadratic relationship with body mass. Early maturation was absent in the coldest temperature treatment. Body-size maturation thresholds were higher in the warmest temperature treatment relative to the ...

AB  - Aquaculture is a growing industry worldwide and Canadian finfish culture is dominated by marine salmonid farming. In part due to increasing public and stakeholder concerns around fish welfare protection, the first-ever Canadian Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Farmed Salmonids was recently completed, following the National Farm Animal Care Council's (NFACC) rigorous Code development process. During this process, both the Scientific (responsible for reviewing existing literature and producing a peer-reviewed report that informs the Code) and Code Development (a diverse group of stakeholders including aquaculture producers, fish transporters, aquaculture veterinarians, animal welfare advocates, food retailers, government, and researchers) Committees identified research gaps in tandem, as they worked through the literature on salmonid physiology, health, husbandry, and welfare. When those lists are combined with the results of a public "top-of-mind" survey conducted by NFACC, they reveal several overlapping areas of scientific, stakeholder, and public concern where scientific evidence is currently lacking: (1) biodensity; (2) health monitoring and management, with a focus on sea lice infection prevention and management; (3) feed quality and management, particularly whether feed restriction or deprivation has consequences for welfare; (4) enclosure design, especially focused on environmental enrichment provision and lighting design; and (5) slaughter and euthanasia. For each of these five research areas, we provide a brief overview of current research on the topic and outline the specific research gaps present. The final section of this review identifies future research avenues that will help address these research gaps, including using existing paradigms developed by terrestrial animal welfare researchers, developing novel methods for assessing fish welfare, and the validation of new salmonid welfare indices. We conclude that there is no dearth of relevant research to be done in the realm of farmed salmonid welfare that can support crucial evidence-based fish welfare policy development.

AB  - Fish and seafood consumption in Australia has been growing, yet the implications of this trend across the food system, from both a health and sustainability perspective have not been fully explored. This paper aims to map out the fish and seafood food system in Australia, linking production and consumption, to articulate challenges and opportunities for enhancing the sector’s contribution to future healthy and sustainable diets. We conducted a secondary analysis of publicly available datasets on fish and seafood production and consumption, triangulated and supplemented with peer-reviewed and grey literature on environmental, economic and social sustainability issues throughout the food system. A key challenge for health is the high proportion of fish and seafood consumed as discretionary food, particularly among children. Key challenges for sustainability include the narrow focus on environmental sustainability (with little consideration of the other domains), and the focus on production with little consideration for sustainability throughout post-harvest handling, processing, retail, distribution and consumption. Key opportunities for health and sustainability include the innovative use of processing and packaging technology to maximise nutritional quality; creation of markets and supply chains for a greater diversity of underutilised fish and seafood species and processing by-products; and reductions in waste and loss throughout the entire supply chain.

AB  - <jats:p>Aquaculture appears to be the most adequate and logical way to suit the protein production problem. Basically, because unlike fisheries that are highly unpredictable, aquaculture rearing is based upon production protocols. This chapter developed an argument supporting the above rationale. As it stands, the evidence suggests that with the current use of information technology, it becomes a common practice to exchange aquaculture knowledge between firms, research bodies, or non-governmental organizations. The interaction between the whole set of stakeholders, where a broad range of know-how and intermediate products and services are developed, generates innovation. Sharing know-how creates open innovation. Open innovation, by its turn, seeks efficiency and generates more sustainable production processes. The way knowledge transfer is delivered and its trends are dependent upon dimensions such as economic, social, and cultural factors.</jats:p>

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the connection between climate change and aquaculture which leads to the questions of greenhouse gas emissions from fisheries and aquaculture products generally. Thus, the carbon footprinting of Individually Quick Frozen Peeled Tail-On Breaded Shrimp was performed to familiarize ourselves with the carbon footprint standard based on the PAS 2050 methodology as well as to establish how high its carbon footprint value is as compared to other aquatic products both from fisheries and aquaculture systems. The system boundary included feed production, shrimp farming, processing, packaging and stopped at the factory gate. In general, the primary data of the processing plant’s direct activities were gathered based on the annual production in 2011 whereas the associated background data were mainly from the national life cycle inventory databases, supplemented by the international life cycle inventory databases where necessary. Raw shrimps at the size of 55-60 (i.e. this usually equates to between 55-66 shrimps per kg) were purchased from multiple farms so primary data were collected from a random sample of associated contracting farms. At the processing stage, the input and output data were gathered from the internal data recording systems with the substitution of missing data if any. The data of primary and secondary packaging were obtained from secondary sources due to their nonsignificant contributions. The total carbon footprint value was 5.88 kgCO2e per kg, mainly from the processing stage (53%), followed by the farming stage (46%). At the farm, the electricity use for aerators to maintain the oxygen level in culturing ponds over the production cycle of 75 days and the utilization of fisheries-based (i.e. fish meal and fish oil) & agriculture-based (i.e. soybean meal) feed ingredients were the major contributors, whereas the use of liquid CO2 for freezing was the major contributor at the processing stage. Compared to other aquatic products, shrimp has a higher carbon footprint value than tilapia but lower than trout. It is worth noting that this information only indicates the impacts to climate change but not other associated impacts.

</jats:title><jats:p>The proliferation of sea lice from aquaculture may substantially aggravate the decline in marine survival of wild salmons. In some countries, this risk has motivated regulators to adopt more precautionary policies; in other countries, however, regulators have disputed the need for stricter regulation. This article compares the sea-lice regulations of Norway, Scotland, Ireland, and Canada (British Columbia), showing how varying interpretations of the science on farm–wild interactions have shaped efforts to scale up regulatory measures for mitigating health hazards and mortality risks for wild salmon. In Norway and Scotland, scientific consensus has expedited cooperation between research and governing institutions and facilitated ambitious policy reforms. In Ireland and Canada, by contrast, scientific controversy around the scale of farm-lice impacts on wild salmon populations has led to conflict and disagreement between researchers and policymakers, and to failure of reform attempts desired by wild salmon stakeholders.</jats:p>

AB  - Large annual escapees of farmed Atlantic salmon enhance the risk of extinction of wild populations through genetic and ecological interactions. Recently, we documented evolutionary change in gene transcription between farmed and wild Atlantic salmon after only five generations of artificial selection. While differences for most quantitative traits are expected to gradually dilute through repeated backcrossing to wild populations, the genetic basis of gene transcription has been shown to be largely nonadditive and hybrid crosses may display unexpected inheritance patterns. This makes it difficult to predict to what extent interbreeding between farmed and wild individuals will change the genetic makeup of wild salmon populations. Here, we compare the genome-wide gene transcription profiles of Norwegian wild salmon to that of a second generation hybrid cross [backcross: (Farmed X Wild) X Wild]. Over 6% (298, q-value < 0.01) of the detected genes exhibited highly significantly different transcription levels, and the range and average magnitude of those differences was strikingly higher than previously described between pure farmed and wild strains. Most differences appear to result from nonadditive gene interactions. These results suggest that interbreeding of fugitive farmed salmon and wild individuals could substantially modify the genetic control of gene transcription in natural populations exposed to high migration from fish farms, resulting in potentially detrimental effects on the survival of these populations. This further supports the idea that measures to considerably reduce the number of escaped farmed salmon and their reproduction in the wild are urgently needed.

AB  - & The escape of cultured fish from a marine aquaculture facility is a type of biological invasion that may lead to a variety of potential ecological and economic effects on native fish. This article develops a general invasive species impact model to capture explicitly both the ecological and economic effects of invasive species, especially escaped farmed fish, on native populations and harvests. First, the possible effects of escaped farmed fish on the growth and stock size of a native fish are examined. Next, a bioeconomic model to analyze changes in yield, benefit distribution, and overall profitability is constructed. Different harvesting scenarios, such as commercial, recreational, and joint commercial and recreational fishing are explored. The model is illustrated by a case study of the interaction between native and farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway. The results suggest that both the harvest and profitability of a native fish stock may decline after an invasion, but the total profits from the harvest of both native and farmed stocks may increase or decrease, depending on the strength of the ecological and economic parameters.

AB  - Lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) serves an important role as cleaner fish for removing salmon lice in salmon aquaculture. For this use, cultivated lumpfish are preferred over wild-caught fish to avoid overexploitation of natural stocks and provide a stable production of good quality eggs and larvae. To support this, high quality eggs containing the necessary building blocks to support high fertilization success, development into a normal embryo and high hatching success is needed. Ova from wild-caught and captive lumpfish females were collected and assessed to identify how wild and domesticated lumpfish differ in terms of ova lipid profiles, egg and larvae quality. Wild-caught lumpfish displayed higher fertilization and hatching success compared to captive lumpfish, whereas other biological variables like egg size, egg/larvae dry weight and respiration, and larval morphometry, were not significantly different between wild and captive lumpfish. Ova lipid profiles (total lipid, lipid classes, fatty acid composition and lipidomics) can separate egg batches based on their geographic origin of wild-caught females and composition of diets used for captive broodstock (lipid and carbohydrate content). Multivariate statistics were applied to identify lipid markers that can be used to predict the quality of lumpfish ova. Lumpfish ova lipidomic profiles covaried with several biological parameters, indicating that the former can be used to predict the latter. Lumpfish eggs were mostly composed of triacylglycerides (TAGs) with some phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and their lipid profiles were more sensitive to the different origins, mother weight/size and fertilization success than variables such as eggs size or larvae morphometric measures. PC and PE content of lumpfish eggs were positively correlated to both hatching success and fertilization rates, thus the lipidomic profiles, with some key highlighted lipid species were putative predictors of egg quality.

AB  - The concern of this article is the language and ontology of negative externalities. Four discourses on the financially successful industry of salmon farming in Norway are critically analyzed and deconstructed. The discourses are: "high turnover discourse", "technology optimism discourse", "first nature discourse" and "traditionalist discourse". Groups defending various discourses differ in their interpretations of a) human/nature relations i.e. either ecocentric, anthropocentric or biocentric, and b) in their respective approach to either a transformative, adaptive or reactive logic. By linking interpretations, concepts and logic inherent to these discourses, it is possible to make conclusions on their degree of coherency. The leading discourses are maintained in language through strategic framing and overdetermination. These linguistic mechanisms are revealed in the discursive application of the concepts of sustainability and wild fish.  Rather than to surrender to relativism, the article recommends integration of realism and deconstruction. Key words: Atlantic salmon farming, food production, critical discourse analysis, negative externalities, soft constructionism, parsimony, political ecology, sustainability.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The aquaculture sector is anticipated to be a keystone in food production systems in the coming decades. However, it is associated with potentially important environmental damages caused by its contribution to eutrophication or climate change, for example. To comprehensively quantify those impacts, life cycle assessment (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">LCA</jats:styled-content>) studies have been conducted on several seafood farming systems for the past 15 years. But, what major findings and common trends can we draw from this pool of studies? What can we learn to provide recommendations to decision and policymakers in the aquaculture sector? To address these questions, we performed a critical review of 65 <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">LCA</jats:styled-content> studies of aquaculture systems from the open literature. We conducted quantitative analyses to explore which impacts can be identified as dominating and to compare different types of aquaculture systems. Our results evidenced that the feed production is a key driver for climate change, acidification, cumulative energy use and net primary production use, while the farming process is a key driver for eutrophication. We also found that different aquaculture systems and technology components may exert considerably different environmental impacts. Based on identified patterns and comparisons, we therefore provided specific recommendations to aquaculture stakeholders for future policy and system development. Overall, the analysis of existing studies demonstrates that important insights can be gained by applying <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">LCA</jats:styled-content> to aquaculture systems, and, to move towards an environmentally sustainable aquaculture sector, we recommend its systematic use in the design of new aquaculture systems or policies, and/or in the evaluation and optimization of existing ones.</jats:p>

AB  - Analysing how fish populations and their ecological communities respond to perturbations such as fishing and environmental variation is crucial to fisheries science. Researchers often predict fish population dynamics using species‐level life‐history parameters that are treated as fixed over time, while ignoring the impact of intraspecific variation on ecosystem dynamics. However, there is increasing recognition of the need to include processes operating at ecosystem levels (changes in drivers of productivity) while also accounting for variation over space, time and among individuals. To address similar challenges, community ecologists studying plants, insects and other taxa increasingly measure phenotypic characteristics of individual animals that affect fitness or ecological function (termed “functional traits”). Here, we review the history of trait‐based methods in fish and other taxa, and argue that fisheries science could see benefits by integrating trait‐based approaches within existing fisheries analyses. We argue that measuring and modelling functional traits can improve estimates of population and community dynamics, and rapidly detect responses to fishing and environmental drivers. We support this claim using three concrete examples: how trait‐based approaches could account for time‐varying parameters in population models; improve fisheries management and harvest control rules; and inform size‐based models of marine communities. We then present a step‐by‐step primer for how trait‐based methods could be adapted to complement existing models and analyses in fisheries science. Finally, we call for the creation and expansion of publicly available trait databases to facilitate adapting trait‐based methods in fisheries science, to complement existing public databases of life‐history parameters for marine organisms.

AB  - We tested the prediction that a complex physical rearing environment would enhance short-term spatial memory as assessed by learning ability in a spatial navigation task in juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. We reared fish in two low-density treatments, where fish were either in bare fiberglass tanks (bare) or in tanks with physical structure (complex). We also tested conventionally reared high-density hatchery fish to compare with these other experimental treatments. Our reason for including this third hatchery treatment is that the two low-density treatments, aside from the manipulation of structure, followed a rearing programme that is designed to produce fish with more wild-like characteristics. We tested individually marked fish for seven consecutive days and recorded movement and time to exit a testing maze. Stimulus conspecific fish outside the exit of the maze provided positive reinforcement for test fish. Fish from the bare treatment were less likely to exit the start box compared with fish in the complex and hatchery treatments. However, fish in the hatchery treatment were significantly more likely to exit the maze on their own compared with both the bare and complex treatments. Hatchery fish effectively learned the task as shown by a decrease in the number of mistakes over time, but the number of mistakes was significantly greater on the first day of trials. Increasing habitat complexity with structure may not necessarily promote spatial learning ability, but differences between hatchery and experimental treatments in rearing density and motivation to be near conspecifics likely led to observed behavioural differences.

AB  - The shrimp and prawn aquaculture sector is a growing component of the global food supply. However, this ongoing growth can lead to environmental implications. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) enables the assessment of these consequences by providing environmental information about the entire value chain. Furthermore, LCA highlights the improvements in environmental performance. This study aims to analyze the literature on LCA of shrimp production at different locations to assess methodological approaches such as functional unit and system boundaries, inventory data collection, impact categories evaluated, and main findings. A literature review in Scopus databases is performed to achieve this aim. Among the reviewed studies, it is observed that the scope of most of them encompasses everything from hatchery to farm gate. Some cases include packaging and transport to the point of destination. The consumption and waste treatment stages have been included in only two cases. The most analyzed impact categories are climate change, eutrophication, and acidification. The critical spots identified are feed formulation and farm energy use. The shrimp aquaculture sector could enhance its environmental performance by incorporating raw materials that replace the consumption of fishmeal and soybean meal in feeds with more sustainable alternatives. The adequate adjustment of the feed conversion ratio could support mitigating the amount of sediment and unconsumed feed, thereby reducing nutrient concentration in discharges. Renewable energy sources could be employed to cover the on-farm demands.

AB  - In recent decades, we have witnessed a rapid increase in world aquaculture production, the so-called ‘blue revolution’. So as to provide a holistic overview of the socio-ecological threats coupled with this increase, a literature review has been conducted. The following seven major socio-ecological impacts were identified: (i) the damage and destruction of natural environments, (ii) discharges; (iii) a risk to wild fish and shellfish populations, (iv) spatial conflicts, (v) threats to food security, (vi) unfairness in the access to commons; and (vii) the unequal distribution of benefits. So as to move forward from ‘blue revolution’ to a ‘blue evolution’ and attain sustainable aquaculture, the following tools have been identified as instrumental for the transition process: technical, management, governance and legal aspects.

AB  - Human contact with and consumption of fishes presents hazards from a range of bacterial zoonotic infections. Whereas many bacterial pathogens have been presented as fish-borne zoonoses on the basis of epidemiological and phenotypic evidence, genetic identity between fish and human isolates is not frequently examined or does not provide support for transmission between these hosts. In order to accurately assess the zoonotic risk from exposure to fishes in the context of aquaculture, wild fisheries and ornamental aquaria, it is important to critically examine evidence of linkages between bacteria infecting fishes and humans. This article reviews bacteria typically presented as fish-borne zoonoses, and examines the current strength of evidence for this classification. Of bacteria generally described as fish-borne zoonoses, only Mycobacterium spp., Streptococcus iniae, Clostridium botulinum, and Vibrio vulnificus appear to be well-supported as zoonoses in the strict sense. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, while transmissible from fishes to humans, does not cause disease in fishes and is therefore excluded from the list. Some epidemiological and/or molecular linkages have been made between other bacteria infecting both fishes and humans, but more work is needed to elucidate routes of transmission and the identity of these pathogens in their respective hosts at the genomic level.

AB  - Smoltification was found to impact both immune and stress responses of farmed Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>), but little is known about how salinity change affects salmon months after completed smoltification. Here, we examined (1) the effect of salinity change from brackish water to seawater on the stress and immune responses in Atlantic salmon and (2) evaluated if functional diets enriched with microalgae can mitigate stress- and immune-related changes. Groups of Atlantic salmon were fed for 8 weeks with different microalgae-enriched diets in brackish water and were then transferred into seawater. Samples of the head kidney, gill, liver and plasma were taken before seawater transfer (SWT), 20 h after SWT, and 2 weeks after SWT for gene-expression analysis, plasma biochemistry and protein quantification. The salmon showed full osmoregulatory ability upon transfer to seawater reflected by high <i>nkaα1b</i> levels in the gill and tight plasma ion regulation. In the gill, one-third of 44 investigated genes were reduced at either 20 h or 2 weeks in seawater, including genes involved in cytokine signaling (<i>il1b</i>) and antiviral defense (<i>isg15, rsad2, ifit5</i>). In contrast, an acute response after 20 h in SW was apparent in the head kidney reflected by increased plasma stress indicators and induced expression of genes involved in acute-phase response (<i>drtp1</i>), antimicrobial defense (<i>camp</i>) and stress response (<i>hspa5</i>). However, after 2 weeks in seawater, the expression of antiviral genes (<i>isg15, rsad2, znfx1</i>) was reduced in the head kidney. Few genes (<i>camp, clra, c1ql2</i>) in the gill were downregulated by a diet with 8% inclusion of <i>Athrospira platensis</i>. The results of the present study indicate that salinity change months after smoltification evokes molecular stress- and immune responses in Atlantic salmon. However, microalgae-enriched functional diets seem to have only limited potential to mitigate the related changes.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is currently an extensive medical challenge worldwide, with global numbers increasing steadily. Recent data have highlighted wastewater treatment plants as a reservoir of resistance genes. The impact of these findings for human health can best be summarized using a One Health concept. However, the molecular mechanisms impacting resistance spread have not been carefully evaluated. Bacterial viruses, that is bacteriophages, have recently been shown to be important mediators of bacterial resistance genes in environmental milieus and are transferrable to human pathogens. Herein, we investigated the biogeographical impact on resistance spread through river-borne bacteriophages using amplicon deep sequencing of the microbiota, absolute quantification of resistance genes using ddPCR, and phage induction capacity within wastewater. Microbial biodiversity of the rivers is significantly affected by river site, surrounding milieu and time of sampling. Furthermore, areas of land associated with agriculture had a significantly higher ability to induce bacteriophages carrying antibiotic resistance genes, indicating their impact on resistance spread. It is imperative that we continue to analyse global antibiotic resistance problem from a One Health perspective to gain novel insights into mechanisms of resistance spread.

AB  - Fish is an excellent source of protein and vitamins for humans, but improperly handled, fish can expose consumers to pathogenic bacteria. This study was aimed to isolate and characterize the genomes of Salmonella strains isolated from imported fish sold in the open market in Ouagadougou. One hundred and fifty-nine fish were collected from open markets and were cultured for Salmonella. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution. Whole-genome sequencing was done to further study antibiotic resistance genes, plasmid replicons, and MSLT types. Serotyping was done using SeqSero 2. Out of the 159 fish samples analyzed, 30 (18.9%) were found to be contaminated with Salmonella. Among the isolated Salmonella strains, six different serotypes, Nima, Liverpool, Kokomlemle, Teshie, Derby, and Tennessee, were found using SeqSero2. Salmonella Tennessee was the predominant serotype. All the isolates possessed at least one resistance gene. The aac6-Iaa aminoglycoside resistance gene was the most prevalent gene found in the strains. The gene fosA7 was detected in three strains. All the S. Nima isolates were of Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST) 8086, S. Teshie isolate was ST 530; Liverpool was ST 1959; Derby was ST 7880; Kokomlemle was ST 2696. The Tennessee isolates gave two different STs including ST 8395 and 8398. The presented results highlight the prevalence of Salmonella on imported fish purchased from the open markets. More attention should be paid regarding fish selling conditions in the country to prevent the potential health risk for consumers.

AB  - The sea louse (Caligus rogercresseyi) is the most relevant parasite for the farmed salmon industry in Chile, the second largest producer worldwide. Although spatial patterns of C. rogercresseyi have been addressed from data obtained from established monitoring and surveillance programs, studies on its spatial ecology are limited. A wide geographic distribution of C. rogercresseyi is presumed in Chile; however, how this species could potentially be distributed in space is unknown. Our study presents an analysis of the habitat suitability for C. rogercresseyi in the entire area occupied by marine sites of salmon farms in Chile. Habitat suitability modeling was used to explore the likelihood of species spatial occurrence based on environmental characteristics. Due to the expanding salmon industry in southern Chile, we studied C. rogercresseyi habitat suitability models for present (average of 2005-2010) and two future projections (2050 and 2100) under different climate change scenarios. Models were constructed with the maxent algorithm using a large database of spatial C. rogercresseyi occurrences from the Chilean fisheries health authority and included 23 environmental variables obtained from the Ocean Rasters for Analysis of Climate and Environment (Bio-ORACLE). Habitat suitability models indicated that water temperature, water salinity, and current velocity of waters were the most important characteristics limiting C. rogercresseyi distribution in southern Chile. Habitat suitability models for current climate indicated a heterogeneous pattern with C. rogercresseyi being present in waters with temperature range 12.12-7.08°C (sd = 0.65), salinity range 33.7-25.5 pss (sd = 1.73), and current water velocity range 0.23-0.01 m-1 (sd = 0.02). Predictions for future projections in year 2050 and year 2100 suggest new clumped dispersion of the environmental conditions for C. rogercresseyi establishment. Our results suggest complexity and a wide dispersion of the biogeographic distribution of the C. rogercresseyi habitat suitability with potential implications for control strategies and environmental issues for salmon farming in Chile. Further investigations are required into C. rogercresseyi distribution in southern Chile considering the possible effect of climate change.

AB  - In this paper we propose a framework for energy audit and renewable energy utilization for a Mediterranean fish hatchery station. A concise literature review concerning the use of renewables in aquaculture is provided, followed by a step by step framework for energy audit in aquaculture stations. The developed framework is subsequently applied to a real case study concerning an aquaculture unit in Greece. A combined PV and Solar-Thermal panel project is proposed, based on the energy audit results. The well-known clean energy software RETScreen, developed by Natural Resources of Canada, has been utilized as an assessment tool of the proposed project. It was found that that the proposed project could not fully cover the electric and thermal load of the station; nevertheless, the project is economically viable and could de realized, provided that the necessary financial resources become available to the entrepreneurs.

AB  - Aquaculture sustainability is restricted by environmental drawbacks such as the pollution derived from the released organic waste. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) aims to lower the input of this waste by culturing other species of low trophic level which feed on them. Despite the appealing idea of IMTA, its implementation is very limited in marine ecosystems. Focusing on marine fish farming, in general terms, fish farm waste is not expected to constitute a relevant food source for low-trophic level organisms cultured in the water column. We propose Regional Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture (RIMTA) as a shift of paradigm in the way IMTA is used to sequester the dissolved exported waste and derived primary production generated by high trophic level cultures. RIMTA advocates for independent allocation of cultures of low and high trophic level species within the same water body. RIMTA implementation should be economically supported through tax benefits or nutrient quota trading schemes. Moving from IMTA to RIMTA should not only foster aquaculture sustainability but also the circular economy and the ecosystem services that the low trophic level cultures provide.

AB  - Millions of tons of plastics enter wild habitats, especially the oceans, every year. Despite extensive efforts, this amount is predicted to increase over in the near future, leading to a catastrophic damage to the environment. Small plastic fragments, including microplastics, are currently widely distributed in different environments and contribute significantly to pollution of the oceans. This problem is particularly poignant in Chile, a country with more than 4,000 km of coastline along the Pacific Ocean home to diverse environments, industrial activities and unique biodiversity. In this review, we compile information regarding microplastics pollution in Chilean environments in terms of transport, distribution and bioaccumulation along the country, societal actions such as environmental policies and education to tackle the plastic problem, and the Trojan effect associated with it. Finally, we identify critical scientific gaps, such as the transport of harmful chemicals and microbial communities associated, and define potential future research directions.

AB  - Large-scale, automation, high process line speeds and a cheap and easily replaceable workforce enabled the industrialisation of slaughter during the 19th and 20th centuries, and continued consolidation, vertical integration and high-tech inventions took the development to the present day. The first mention of organised mobile slaughter may have been in the United States towards the end of the 20th century. Since then, the development has to some extent been determined by regulations on official meat inspections. At present, fish, poultry, livestock, reindeer and bison are slaughtered in various types of mobile establishments across many countries, but the total numbers are not known. This chapter examines the implications of mobile slaughter for animal welfare, followed by a discussion on its sustainability and feasibility. Finally, reference is made to many training resources that provide guidance for those considering setting up a mobile slaughterhouse, and summarise experiences from already started or completed projects in several countries. By eliminating liveanimal transport and increasing farmers' control over the food chain, mobile slaughter contributes to rural development and potentially improves animal welfare and meat quality. The success of mobile abattoirs is affected by many factors and profitability largely depends on the opportunities to create added value and get premium retail prices for end products. Practical experience and further research can provide a basis for a slightly more liberal view of local meat and mobile slaughter.

AB  - For intensive production systems like the Blue Ridge Aquaculture (BRA), based in Martinsville, VA, there are significant economic incentives to reuse the waste by diverting it into a cropping system that would increase the total productivity and total resource-reuse efficiency, and decrease the environmental, ecological, and financial costs of aquacultural waste disposal. In order to facilitate the reuse of effluent from the tilapia production at the BRA, a green house was developed. On this site, sludge waste from recirculating aquaculture was separated and composted using a vermicomposting technique and the resulting compost was utilized as an amendment to conventional greenhouse potting mixes. These aquacultural waste products were compared to conventional greenhouse culture of a common ornamental annual plant. It was hypothesized that (1) vermicomposted aquaculture sludge would increase the growth of plants over conventional greenhouse potting mixes, and (2) recycled aquacultural wastewater can serve as a quality source of irrigation water, and plant response would differ with irrigation method. Plant growth and 11 out of 12 plant tissue nutrients were greater when compost was increased in the substrate. Plant root growth and 3 out of 12 tissue nutrients were increased when irrigated with wastewater. Plant shoot mass and total mass was greater when irrigated by ebb and flow irrigation compared to overhead mist irrigation, and 4 out of 12 tissue nutrients were greater when irrigated with mist irrigation. Overall plant performance was greatest with 15% vermicomposted sludge in the substrate and watered with wastewater by ebb and flow irrigation.

AB  - The relationships between energy use in food systems, food system productivity, and energy resource constraints are complex. Moreover, ongoing changes in food production and consumption norms concurrent with urbanization, globalization, and demographic changes underscore the importance of energy use in food systems as a food security concern. Here, we review the current state of knowledge with respect to the energy intensity of agriculture and food systems. We highlight key drivers and trends in food system energy use along with opportunities for and constraints on improved efficiencies. In particular, we point toward a current dearth of research with respect to the energy performance of food systems in developing countries and provide a cautionary note vis-a-vis increasing food system energy dependencies in the light of energy price volatility and concerns as to long-term fossil energy availabilities.

Yet conservation strategies differ in the type of adaptive outcomes they promote as conservation goals. For instance, strategies based on genetic or demographic rescue implicitly target adaptive population states whereas strategies utilizing transgenerational plasticity or evolutionary rescue implicitly target adaptive processes. These two goals are somewhat polar: adaptive state strategies optimize current population fitness, which should reduce phenotypic and/or genetic variance, reducing adaptability in changing or uncertain environments; adaptive process strategies increase genetic variance, causing maladaptation in the short term, but increase adaptability over the long term. Maladaptation refers to suboptimal population fitness, adaptation refers to optimal population fitness, and (mal)adaptation refers to the continuum of fitness variation from maladaptation to adaptation. Here, we present a conceptual classification for conservation that implicitly considers (mal)adaptation in the short-term and long-term outcomes of conservation strategies. We describe cases of how (mal)adaptation is implicated in traditional conservation strategies, as well as strategies that have potential as a conservation tool but are relatively underutilized. We use a meta-analysis of a small number of available studies to evaluate whether the different conservation strategies employed are better suited toward increasing population fitness across multiple generations. We found weakly increasing adaptation over time for transgenerational plasticity, genetic rescue, and evolutionary rescue. Demographic rescue was generally maladaptive, both immediately after conservation intervention and after several generations. Interspecific hybridization was adaptive only in the F1 generation, but then rapidly leads to maladaptation. Management decisions that are made to support the process of adaptation must adequately account for (mal)adaptation as a potential outcome and even as a tool to bolster adaptive capacity to changing conditions.

AB  - The rapid increase in world population, combined with the rising expectation for more nutritional diets in many rapidly developing economies, is creating a strong demand for the protein-rich materials used for human consumption and/or animal feed. Meeting such a demand is already exerting significant pressure on the environment and creating significant pressure for identifying and implementing more sustainable approaches for protein production and utilization. This looming problem needs to be addressed quickly, considering the recent accelerating rise in feed and food prices and their subsequent impact on the sociopolitical stability of several developing societies. This paper quickly reviews the environmental impact of current practices used for meeting the world's protein needs. It then introduces an environmentally-friendly novel approach for converting natural gas into Single Cell Protein that can be used as an ingredient in animal feed formulations. After reviewing the historical background for this approach and the various factors affecting its sustainability, the main impediments to its widespread adoption are discussed, and several means for enhancing the overall sustainability of the approach are presented.

AB  - There is a significant body of legislation affecting veterinary medicines, including those intended for use in fish. However, the main criteria for authorization remain quality, efficacy and safety. Safety for humans, both operators and consumers, is of paramount importance in the assessment process. Consumer safety is largely addressed through the maximum residue limit (MRL) approach with withdrawal periods being established to ensure that the MRL is not exceeded? Residues monitoring plays an important role in ensuring that withdrawal periods are observed and that illegal drugs are not used.

AB  - The extent and effect of disease interaction and pathogen exchange between wild and farmed fish populations is an ongoing debate and an area of research that is difficult to explore. The objective of this study was to investigate pathogen transmission between farmed and wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations in Norway by means of molecular epidemiology. Piscine reovirus (PRV) was selected as the model organism as it is widely distributed in both farmed and wild Atlantic salmon in Norway, and because infection not necessarily will lead to mortality through development of disease. A matrix comprised of PRV protein coding sequences S1, S2 and S4 from wild, hatchery-reared and farmed Atlantic salmon in addition to one sea-trout (Salmo trutta L.) was examined. Phylogenetic analyses based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference indicate long distance transport of PRV and exchange of virus between populations. The results are discussed in the context of Atlantic salmon ecology and the structure of the Norwegian salmon industry. We conclude that the lack of a geographical pattern in the phylogenetic trees is caused by extensive exchange of PRV. In addition, the detailed topography of the trees indicates long distance transportation of PRV. Through its size, structure and infection status, the Atlantic salmon farming industry has the capacity to play a central role in both long distance transportation and transmission of pathogens. Despite extensive migration, wild salmon probably play a minor role as they are fewer in numbers, appear at lower densities and are less likely to be infected. An open question is the relationship between the PRV sequences found in marine fish and those originating from salmon.

AB  - Abstract Aquaculture is a major contributor to global food production, but has attracted considerable controversy. Disagreements over the social and ecological impacts of aquaculture (positive and negative) have hindered further expansion of aquaculture production, particularly in wealthy democratic countries. This article presents findings from a series of workshops bringing international aquaculture scholars together from the natural and social sciences to examine and compare social-ecological challenges facing aquaculture development in five nations: Canada, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. This multinational comparison provides unique insights into common and particular challenges in aquaculture governance – a dimension that is missing in current literature about the industry. A political ecology framework from the environmental social sciences is used to examine how natural and human phenomena interact to shape these challenges and frame the conflicts that often result. The analysis reveals a wide range of social-ecological factors limiting aquaculture expansion in the five countries, including access to suitable environments, interactions with other sectors, and policy and regulatory gaps – not only with respect to aquaculture, but also on related issues such as marine spatial planning and the involvement of indigenous peoples in decision-making. The findings provide preliminary guidance for future policy development and comparative aquaculture research.

AB  - Open marine net pens facilitate virus and sea lice transfer, occasionally leading to infections and outbreaks of disease in farmed salmon. A review of 3 salmon pathogens (infectious salmon anaemia virus [ISAV], salmon alphavirus [SAV] and the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis) shows that increased risk of exposure to neighbouring farms is inversely related to distance from and directly related to biomass at the source of infection. Epidemiological techniques integrating data from oceanography, diagnostics and pathogen shedding rates and viability contribute to improved understanding of pathogen transmission pathways among farms and permit the designation of areas of risk associated with sources of infection. Occupation of an area of risk may increase the likelihood of exposure, infection and disease among susceptible fish. Disease mitigation in mariculture occurs at 2 scales: area-based (coordinated stocking, harvesting and fallowing) and farm-based (vaccination, early pathogen detection, veterinary prescribed treatments and depopulation or early harvest in the event of viral disease). Collectively, implementation of mitigation measures results in virus disease outbreaks of shorter duration with lower mortality and therefore reduces the likelihood of pathogen transmission. In contrast, the mitigation of sea lice transmission is less likely to be effective in some areas due to the loss of parasite sensitivity to thera peutants and to dissemination of larval lice when parasites occur below management thresholds. For wild populations, risk of pathogen spillback is estimated from farm-based epidemiological data; however, validation, particularly for ISAV and SAV, is required using direct surveillance.

AB  - Veterinarians, veterinary nurses and allied personnel may be potentially exposed to veterinary medicinal products during the course of their work. However, such exposures, should they occur, need to be considered in context as veterinary professionals face numerous other hazards and associated risks. Of these, the major examples are physical injuries which may be animal-associated such as biting, crushing or goring, or they be of other origins and include slipping, falling and injuries associated with lifting. The most common injuries are needlestick injuries associated with the administration of injectable products. Except for pain at the injection site due to physical injury, the majority of these accidents are asymptomatic but adverse effects may ensue if the initial injury is followed by drug administration. Other hazards include zoonotic diseases, dermatoses and allergies. Some cancer types appear to have increased incidences in veterinarians. An increased incidence of melanoma may be due to skin exposure as a result of working outdoors and exposure to sunlight. However, increases in the incidences of other tumour types are more difficult to explain. It is unlikely that the use of X-ray equipment, particularly of more modern devices, contributes to this excess incidence. Veterinarians appear to suffer from a higher degree of mental illness when compared with the general population. The reasons for this are unknown but they may include the effects of working in an isolated environment, stress and work overload. Any adverse effects relating to occupational exposure to veterinary medicinal products must be seen in the wider context of occupational issues relating to work in the veterinary sector. However, this does not mean that hazards and risks should be overlooked but that appropriate mitigation measures should be considered and if necessary, acted upon.

AB  - In this article, we investigate how the uncertain consequences of sea lice agents on the environment affect the management process, focusing on the coastal shrimp in Norway. In this context, the key stakeholders (shrimp fishers and aquaculture owners) have conflicting interests and understand uncertainty from different perspectives. We ask: (1) How do fishers and aquaculture representatives translate uncertainty into risk, and do they link uncertainty to the precautionary approach or not? (2) How is uncertainty dealt with scientifically and related to decisions made by the authorities? Finally, we address organizational aspects related to a “post-normal approach” and ask: (3) Is it possible to organize the risk assessment process differently, to ensure more effective and legitimate advice? In order to answer these questions, we understand these issues as post-normal ones, and lean on both Science and Technology Studies and Risk Governance theory. We use a mix of social scientific methods including literature review, participatory observation, and semi-structured interviews. Our findings indicate that since the effect of sea lice agents is an uncontrollable problem ridden with uncertainty, science alone is insufficient, calling for a more participatory approach.

AB  - The European Commission requested EFSA to assess, in collaboration with EMA, the specific concentrations of antimicrobials resulting from cross-contamination in non-target feed for food-producing animals below which there would not be an effect on the emergence of, and/or selection for, resistance in microbial agents relevant for human and animal health, as well as the levels of the antimicrobials which could have a growth promotion/increase yield effect. The assessment was performed for 24 antimicrobial active substances, as specified in the mandate. This scientific opinion describes the methodology used, and the main associated data gaps and uncertainties. To estimate the antimicrobial levels in the non-target feed that would not result in emergence of, and/or selection for, resistance, a model was developed. This 'Feed Antimicrobial Resistance Selection Concentration' (FARSC) model is based on the minimal selective concentration (MSC), or the predicted MSC (PMSC) if MSC for the most susceptible bacterial species is unavailable, the fraction of antimicrobial dose available for exposure to microorganisms in the large intestine or rumen (considering pharmacokinetic parameters), the daily faecal output or rumen volume and the daily feed intake. Currently, lack of data prevents the establishment of PMSC and/or FARSC for several antimicrobials and animal species. To address growth promotion, data from an extensive literature search were used. Specific assessments of the different substances grouped by antimicrobial classes are addressed in separate scientific opinions. General conclusions and recommendations were made.

AB  - <jats:p>With an estimated global value of US$15.6 billion, farmed salmonids represent a precious food resource, which is also the fastest increasing food producing industry with annual growth of 7% in production. A total average of 3,594,000 metric tonnes was produced in 2020, behind Chinese and Indian carps, tilapias and catfishes. Lead producers of farmed salmonids are Norway, Chile, Faroe, Canada and Scotland, stimulated by increasing global demand and market. However, over the last 2 years, production has been declining, occasioned by effects of diseases as well as rising feed costs. Over the last year, production has declined sharply due to effects of covid-19. This chapter reviews the species in culture, systems of culture, environmental footprints of salmon culture, and market trends in salmon culture. Burden of diseases, especially Infectious pancreatic Necrosis, Infectious salmon anemia and furunculosis, as well as high cost of feed formulation, key challenges curtailing growth of the salmon production industry, are discussed. A review is made of the international salmon genome sequencing effort, selective breeding for disease resistance, and the use of genomics to mitigate challenges of diseases that stifle higher production of salmonids globally.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of acoustic telemetry for monitoring fish during farm operations and gather knowledge about Atlantic salmon responses during crowding and delousing events in a commercial sea-cage. 21 fish were equipped with a novel transmitter tag type using data from pressure sensors and accelerometers to compute swimming depth and swimming activity of individual fish. The fish were monitored over four months, during which they were subjected to three thermal delousing events. In the periods before and after delousing, the fish generally exhibited a circadian rhythm in both swimming activity and depth, with high activity and deep swimming during daytime and low activity and shallow swimming during night. Swimming activity recorded during crowding and delousing events was significantly higher than background swimming activity levels registered a day before and after delousing. Although activity levels differed significantly between the three events and between the different stages within each event, the highest activity levels were consistently measured during thermal treatment. Swimming depth differed significantly between delousing events and was strongly influenced by daylight. In summary, crowding and delousing induced increased movement in the fish, while swimming depth appeared to be less sensitive to these operations. The conclusion of the study is that acoustic telemetry is a suitable tool for monitoring fish during challenging operations such as crowding and delousing, as well as during normal cage management. Moreover, this study provides new knowledge on how the behaviour of Atlantic salmon may be affected by delousing.

AB  - The increasing demand for fish products and the stagnation of capture fisheries has promoted the growth of aquaculture globally, leading to a significant increase in socio-environmental conflicts mainly in relation with finfish aquaculture. Despite this significant global growth, the European aquaculture sector has instead experienced stagnation in the last decade. While European public authorities are currently encouraging the growth of the sector in order to change this trajectory, conflicts over finfish aquaculture have nonetheless already taken place in Europe. Based on peer-reviewed articles, gray literature, and 27 in-depth interviews, this article analyzes such conflicts in Europe in the last two decades by examining their localities, characteristics, the different actors involved, and the arguments of these actors. In this way, it explores the relation of these conflicts to environmental justice theory. Findings highlight that resistances to marine finfish aquaculture in Europe do not have a purely conservationist motivation, but rather entail a complex set of claims supported by various actors. These include demands for an even distribution of burdens and benefits resulting from marine finfish aquaculture, the right to be recognized as relevant stakeholders, an effective participation process where actors have access to adequate and transparent information and a real capacity to influence the decision-making, and to be able to maintain their social functioning. Based on this analysis, the article derives political lessons for future European marine policies.

AB  - Seaweeds absorb inorganic nutrient wastes from mariculture and reduce their undesirable environmental effects. Mariculture in Saudi Arabia is increasing rapidly, thus, to exploit aquaculture wastes and to reduce coastal pollution risks, local seaweeds were cultured using mariculture effluents in integration on the Red Sea coast. The aim of the present study was to test integrated aquaculture of seaweed and marine fish (Oreochromis spilurus) for the first time in Saudi Arabia and to determine the seaweeds, Ulva lactuca and Gracilaria arcuata, biomass production and inorganic nutrient bioremediation capabilities. Results showed that G. arcuata grew at a significantly higher rate (2.71% wet weight day−1) than U. lactuca (1.77% wet weight day−1). The biomass yield (42.38 g wet weight m−2 day−1) and net yield (91.11 g wet weight day−1) of G. arcuata were also significantly higher than U. lactuca (27.39 g wet weight m−2 day−1 and 58.89 g wet weight day−1, respectively). Gracilaria arcuata removed 0.45 g m−2 day−1 of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) with 80.15% removal efficiency and 1.03 g m−2 day−1 of soluble phosphate with 41.06% efficiency. Ulva lactuca removed 0.42 g m−2 day−1 of TAN with 83.06% removal efficiency and 1.07 g m−2 day−1 of soluble phosphate with 41.11% efficiency. Total tissue carbon of both species reached 25.1–26.9% and nitrogen content reached 3.0–3.2% of dry weight. The C/N ratio for both seaweeds was <10, indicating that nitrogen was not a limiting factor in culture. Both seaweeds are suitable for integrated aquaculture and bioremediation, but G. arcuata has relatively higher growth potential.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, salmon aquaculture has struggled to mitigate the impact of harmful jellyfish species in northern Europe and beyond. Typically, large aggregations of jellyfish are carried by currents through salmon pens, leading to unsustainable mortality levels in some years. One potential solution that has been regularly proposed is the creation of a ‘bubble curtain’ around fish pens. A bubble curtain is created by releasing compressed air from a perforated tube at depth, forming a plume of bubbles that entrain the water to create a vertical current. This study investigated the efficacy of a bubble curtain as a jellyfish barrier at several aquaculture locations in Ireland and in a controlled flume tank. Field tests on bubble curtains provided mixed results: a high air flow 8 m linear bubble curtain set at 5 m depth effectively deflected large compass jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella), whereas, a low air flow ca. 800 m circular bubble curtain set at 5 m depth, around a salmon farm, did not significantly impact the abundance of small hydromedusae on either side of the bubble curtain. Flume tank experiments demonstrated that increased wave height and increased air flow increased jellyfish transport through the curtain and the lateral movement was consistent with Stokes drift, i.e. an elliptical motion that includes forward movement with each wave. These results suggest that sites with relatively high wave energy may be unsuitable for bubble curtain use and that the variable size and shape of jellyfish may be an important factor in jellyfish and bubble curtain interactions.

AB  - Abstract Sea lice are marine ectoparasitic crustacea which limit the potential for sustainable salmon aquaculture due to risks of impacts on iconic wild salmon and sea trout. Control of the parasite on farms costs an estimated 9% of farm revenue. Sea lice develop through planktonic nauplii to copepodid stages which attach to, and mature on, salmonid hosts until females become ovigerous (egg laying) Impacts of lice on wild fish depend on their exposure to planktonic larval lice transported from salmon farms, which consists of (A) production of larval lice from ovigerous female lice on salmon farms, (B) local concentrations of planktonic larval lice infectious copepodids in adjacent waters, (C) rates of infestation of wild fish given these concentrations, and (D) impact on fish given this level of interaction. A model of this local exposure around salmon farms was developed. Production rates for nauplii as a function of the numbers of adult lice on salmon farms and maturation to copepodids (A) is well studied, as are impacts of infestation (D), with >0.75 lice per gram of host fish considered to present a high risk of mortality. Using existing assessments of infectious copepodid production (A) we develop a model of copepodid concentration (B) based on a simple kernel of copepodid distribution around farms; within this kernel the copepodids are assumed either to disperse evenly or to be transported in a concentrated plume, allowing comparison of the range of different concentration distributions. These distributions combine with a model of infestation (C) based on small-scale movements of copepodids in the immediate vicinity of a swimming fish. Fish swimming at intermediate velocities are most susceptible to infestation, as slow fish exhaust lice in their immediate vicinity while fast fish move on before lice copepodids can approach. These models are combined to create an assessment of the risk that concentrations can result in infestation of fish at levels considered to cause mortalities (D). The results can be used in combination with empirical assessments as a tool to link potential impacts on wild salmonids to aquaculture biomass and on-farm lice management in different environments in support of strategic aquaculture planning. Our modelling demonstrates the, often neglected, importance of fine-scale processes in sea lice infestation of salmonids.

AB  - <jats:p>Lately, agriculture, livestock, forestry, and aquaculture activities have been greatly developed in Chilean North Patagonia, negatively impacting the balance of the environmental conditions in lakes and affecting the development and survival of several native species. The aim of this study was to assess the anthropic impact on a zooplankton community in two North Patagonian lakes. We collected samples from four sites belonging to Lake Icalma and Lake Llanquihue, including four replicates per site. Water samples were analyzed for physicochemical characteristics and zooplankton communities. We focused on the presence of Daphnia pulex, a species of zooplanktonic crustacean that performs a key role in capturing energy from primary producers to deliver it to final consumers such as fish. We found that Llanquihue showed higher total phosphorus, nitrogen, copper, iron, manganese, total dissolved solids (TDS), and conductivity (EC) than Icalma. Furthermore, ecological variables were greatly decreased due to total P, total N, manganese, copper, total dissolved solids, and conductivity, which changed the species dominance of the zooplankton community in Llanquihue, indicating some degree of anthropization. This study provides fundamental information on the anthropogenic impact on water quality, as well as on zooplankton diversity, highlighting the importance of monitoring the health of these North Patagonia freshwater ecosystems.</jats:p>

AB  - In low- and middle-income countries, data on antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in aquaculture are scarce. Therefore, summarizing documented data on AMU, antimicrobial residue (AR), and AMR in aquaculture in Africa is key to understanding the risk to public health. Google Scholar, PubMed, African Journals online, and Medline were searched for articles published in English and French following the PRISMA guidelines. A structured search string was used with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to retrieve and screen the articles. The pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each pathogen-antimicrobial pair using random effects models. Among the 113 full-text articles reviewed, 41 met the eligibility criteria. The majority of the articles reported AMR (35; 85.4%), while a few were on AMU (3; 7.3%) and AR (3; 7.3%) in fish. The articles originated from West Africa (23; 56.1%), North Africa (8; 19.7%), and East Africa (7; 17.1%). Concerning the antimicrobial agents used in fish farming, tetracycline was the most common antimicrobial class used, which justified the high prevalence of residues (up to 56.7%) observed in fish. For AMR, a total of 69 antimicrobial agents were tested against 24 types of bacteria isolated. Bacteria were resistant to all classes of antimicrobial agents and exhibited high levels of multidrug resistance. Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. were reported in 16, 10, and 8 studies, respectively, with multidrug resistance rates of 43.1% [95% CI (32.0-55.0)], 40.3% [95% CI (24.1-58.1)] and 31.3% [95% CI (17.5-49.4)], respectively. This review highlights the high multidrug resistance rate of bacteria from aquaculture to commonly used antimicrobial agents, such as tetracycline, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, and amoxicillin, in Africa. These findings also highlighted the lack of data on AMU and residue in the aquaculture sector, and additional efforts should be made to fill these gaps and mitigate the burden of AMR on public health in Africa.

AB  - Understanding the extent, scale and genetic basis of local adaptation (LA) is important for conservation and management. Its relevance in salmonids at microgeographic scales, where dispersal (and hence potential gene flow) can be substantial, has however been questioned. Here, we compare the fitness of communally reared offspring of local and foreign Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from adjacent Irish rivers and reciprocal F1 hybrid crosses between them, in the wild ‘home’ environment of the local population. Experimental groups did not differ in wild smolt output but a catastrophic flood event may have limited our ability to detect freshwater performance differences, which were evident in a previous study. Foreign parr exhibited higher, and hybrids intermediate, emigration rates from the natal stream relative to local parr, consistent with genetically based behavioural differences. Adult return rates were lower for the foreign compared to the local group. Overall lifetime success of foreigners and hybrids relative to locals was estimated at 31% and 40% (mean of both hybrid groups), respectively. The results imply a genetic basis to fitness differences among populations separated by only 50 km, driven largely by variation in smolt to adult return rates. Hence even if supplementary stocking programs obtain broodstock from neighbouring rivers, the risk of extrinsic outbreeding depression may be high.

AB  - L'aquaculture integree a ete proposee comme un moyen d'epuration des effluents, en particulier ceux produits par l'elevage d'animaux de niveau trophique eleve qui necessite un apport externe d'energie (alimentation). L'elevage d'animaux filtreurs et d'algues marines a proximite de cages a poissons a ainsi ete teste comme moyen d'epuration. Cependant, le succes de ces tentatives n'a pas ete total en partie parce que les quantites de filtreurs et d'algues requises pour abaisser de maniere significative les quantites d'effluents produits par des elevages intensifs sont demesurees. Aussi, des sytemes semi-fermes ou bases a terre ont ete proposes comme alternative technologique pour une aquaculture integree. Les sytemes a terre sont techniquement realisables bien qu'ils necessitent aujourd'hui des investissements eleves, qui limitent leurs extensions. Au Chili, l'elevage du saumon est tres developpe et produit plus de 200.000 tonnes par an. Avec l'expansion rapide de l'elevage du saumon, les preoccupations concernant ses consequences sur l'environnement se sont accrues. Nous avons donc realise des experiences pour integrer la culture de l'algue rouge agarophyte Gracilaria aux fermes de saumon. Nos resultats indiquent que cette algue est capable de prelever des proportions significatives de l'ammoniaque excretee par les poissons. Des etudes sur des systemes de culture integree a terre indiquent que la production de poissons peut atteindre 30 kg m -3 , avec une production associee de Gracilaria de 49 kg (poids humide) m -2 an -1 . Le benefice pour l'environnement du developpement de bassins de culture integree a ete etabli par l'analyse de donnees publiees ou non publiees. En tenant compte des resultats de production atteints, une analyse des profits a ete realisee en integrant les benefices pour l'environnement. Comme les rejets d'effluents sont considerablement reduits lorsque l'on integre la culture d'algues marines dans la ferme de poisson, les profits d'un projet commercial ne sont pas du tout affectes par la prise en compte des couts environnementaux et restent comparables a ceux realises dans une situation ou il n'y pas de contraintes environnementales.

AB  - A puzzling question in conservation biology is how to maintain overall fitness of individuals bred in captive environment upon release into the wild, especially for rehabilitating declining or threatened species. For salmonid species, a heritable change in fitness related traits and gene expression has been reported to occur in a single generation of captivity in hatchery environment. Such rapid changes are congruent with models of inadvertent domestication selection which may lead to maladaptation in the natural environment. Arguably, the underlying mechanism by which captivity may induce fitness difference between wild and captive congeners is still poorly understood. Short-term selection on complex phenotypic traits is expected to induce subtle changes in allele frequency over multiple loci. Yet, most studies investigating the molecular basis for rapid change in fitness related traits occurring in hatchery have concentrated their effort on finding evidence for selection at the genome level by identifying loci with large effect. Numerous wild stocks of Pacific anadromous salmon and trout (genus Oncorhynchus and Salmo) have experienced fluctuating abundance over the past century, with a series of sharp declines. With the objectives of preserving ecosystem integrity, enhancing declining populations and sustaining fisheries, conservation hatcheries have been flourishing. This is particularly true along the North American Pacific coast where billions of salmonids, all species included, are released each year. Despite substantial improvement of production management, the beneficial ecological role of hatcheries in enhancing and restoring wild stocks is still debated, mainly because of the reduced fitness and maladaptation of hatchery-fish when released in the wild. Although previous studies showed that domestication selection was involved in such fitness impairment, they also observed that different environmental conditions (e.g. reduced fish density) significantly modulated the physiological acclimation to hatchery environment. Environmental stimuli are especially relevant during early embryonic development, which also correspond to a sensitive methylation reprogramming window in vertebrates. It is therefore plausible that differences in rearing environment during early development may result in epigenetic modifications that could in turn impact on fitness. However, the only epigenetic study to date pertaining to captive rearing in salmonids and performed using methylation-sensitive amplified fragments (MSAP) failed to identify significant changes in methylation profile associated with hatchery rearing. Here, we used a higher resolution approach to compare the genome-wide pattern of methylation in hatchery-reared juvenile (smolt) Coho Salmon with that of their wild counterparts in two geographically distant rivers in British Columbia, Canada. Using a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) approach covering an average per individual of about 70 million cytosines in CpG context, we identified 100 methylated regions (DMRs) that differed in parallel between hatchery and natural origin salmon in both rivers. The total variance of epigenetic variation among individuals explained by river or origin and rearing environment in a RDA model was 16% (adj.R2=0.16), and both variables equally explained about 8% of the variance after controlling for each other. The gene ontology analysis revealed that regions with different methylation levels between hatchery and natural origin salmon showed enrichment for ion homeostasis, synaptic and neuromuscular regulation, immune and stress response, and control of locomotion functions. We further identified 15,044 SNPs that allowed detection of significant differences between either rivers or sexes. However, no effect of rearing environment was observed, confirming that hatchery and natural origin fish of a given river belong to the same panmictic population, as expected based on the hatchery programs applied in these rivers (see Supplementary experimental procedures). Moreover, neither a standard genome-scan approach nor a polygenic statistical framework allowed detection of selective effects within a single generation between hatchery and natural origin salmon. Therefore, this is the first study to demonstrate that parallel epigenetic modifications induced by hatchery rearing during early development may represent a potential explanatory mechanism for rapid change in fitness-related traits previously reported in salmonids.

AB  - Abstract This study presents a life cycle greenhouse gas and energy assessment for two algal biofuel production pathways: biodiesel produced through lipid extraction (LE) and renewable diesel produced through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The two production pathways generate different co-products, which are handled through allocation in life cycle assessment-based analyses. The method and assumptions used for co-product allocation affect the performance of the analyzed fuels, and are thus examined through scenario analysis; five co-product allocation strategies are tested for the LE pathway and six are tested for the HTL pathway. After allocation, the carbon intensity of renewable diesel varies from 36 to 54 gCO2e/MJ, and the primary energy consumption of renewable diesel varies from 0.7 to 1.2 MJ/MJ; while the carbon intensity of biodiesel ranges, remarkably, from −59 to 125 gCO2e/MJ, and the primary energy consumption of biodiesel ranges from 0.1 to 1.7 MJ/MJ. The optimal algal oil production pathway is determined by comparing open-loop and closed-loop systems, considering not only the estimated net environmental impacts, but also the confidence or uncertainty of those outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Despite being an economic success and generating considerable profit, the Norwegian salmon farming industry face environmental challenges that need to be solved. Since 2014, all new licenses to farm salmon are labelled either “light-green”, dark-green” or “development licenses”. The industry is nevertheless characterized by the open net-pen as a hegemonic technology, and is susceptible to both cognitive and political lock-in. In the article, it is defined which narratives on “greening criteria” that are dominant and an analysis is presented on how narratives influence new licenses for salmon farming. The data is derived from 52 qualitative interviews and a broad qualitative analysis of trends and debates in the industry. From the perspective of evolutionary economic geography and the sub-concept path dependency, narratives on greening criteria for future salmon farming are divided in three categories: path extension, modest path renewal and strong path renewal. The findings reveal that although most licenses are linked to mere path extension, development licenses might disrupt this trend.

AB  - As the world opens up from the clutches of the pandemic to heightened demand for goods and services, businesses inextricably interconnected globally are coping to meet this demand due to worker shortages. In honor of Peter Keen, this editorial offers insight into how the quest for global talent can be addressed. Our work on how knowledge networking enables innovation through the creation of talent pools and the Global Capability Sourcing (GCS) model are combined to offer a view into addressing this challenge. The GCS explains why wages are declining for some skills while rising for others and asks: what role does a company most effectively play in the global sourcing economy? When workers are free to choose where and when they offer their services, the development imperative comes into effect. The development imperative is freedom of choice and can occur through innovation in talent pools stimulated through knowledge networking. When people have greater freedom and capabilities to improve their knowledge and skills, their incomes increase along with the range of choices and capabilities enjoyed by their households and governments. The papers in this issue add to what is known about how digital competency can be stimulated through investments in ICT training programs, how innovations take place in the development context and insights into conducting context-sensitive research.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This review focuses on the current status of antibiotics use, effects on animal health and the environment, existing policies and regulatory mechanisms in the top 15 producing countries. Fifty papers were reviewed and represented the bulk of literature worldwide. We observed that 67 antibiotic compounds were used in 11 of the 15 countries between 2008 and 2018. Among these countries, 73% applied oxytetracycline, sulphadiazine and florfenicol. On average, countries used 15 antibiotics and the top users included Vietnam (39), China (33) and Bangladesh (21). On environmental and health risks, the review revealed sufficient evidence that directly links antibiotics use to food safety, occupational health hazards and antimicrobial resistance. Environmental risks included residue accumulation, aquatic biodiversity toxicity, microbial community selection for antibiotic resistance and the emergence of multi‐antibacterial resistant strains. Regarding policies, major players were the European Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Norwegian Veterinary Institute, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Codex and government ministries. In particular, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and Norwegian Veterinary Institute demonstrated the most outstanding regulation mechanisms of antibiotics use in aquaculture that needs to be emulated. The future of aquaculture lies in guaranteeing the supply of safe aquatic products to the growing consumer market. Thus, international coordination of the policy and regulatory environment is needed, while increased investment in research for alternative aquatic health management strategies is essential. Future technologies should focus on the reduction of antibiotics use to safeguard the environment and ensure safety of consumers, feed industry and aquaculture workers.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Chile is the second largest producer of salmon (only behind Norway), and high amounts of antimicrobials are used during the marine stage, mainly florfenicol. Intensive antimicrobials use is a relevant concern, prompting the urgent need for use reduction and advancements towards more restricted, efficient application. This review describes the historic and current use of antimicrobials in Chilean salmonid farming. Further covered is the experimental evidence reported to date, thus providing a clearer understanding for the pathogenic nature of <jats:italic>Piscirickettsia salmonis</jats:italic>—the most important bacterial pathogen and the main target of antimicrobials used in the Chilean industry. This review also assesses research exploring the impacts of antimicrobial treatment on the environment, as well as investigations on the antibiotic susceptibility of salmonid pathogens. This review of the scientific literature contributes to a more unbiased appraisal of the current situation in Chile. Unfortunately, various previous reports dealing with/on the antimicrobial use in the Chilean salmon farming industry have been arrived to insufficiently supported conclusions, thus the present review aims to clarify outdated or poorly substantiated information and assumptions in existing literature. The consequences of antimicrobials in fish farming are covered by this review, which is particularly relevant considering potential impacts on aquatic environments. Focus is given to the selection and spread of drug‐resistant bacteria and associated resistance‐encoding genes. Finally, herein are provided several recommendations from a One Health perspective for decreasing amounts of used antimicrobials, effectively controlling primary bacterial fish pathogens, developing proper prevention strategies and reducing the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance.</jats:p>

AB  - Understanding the origins of complexity is a key challenge in many sciences. Although networks are known to underlie most systems, showing how they contribute to well-known phenomena remains an issue. Here, we show that recurrent phase transitions in network connectivity underlie emergent phenomena in many systems. We identify properties that are typical of systems in different connectivity phases, as well as characteristics commonly associated with the phase transitions. We synthesize these common features into a common framework, which we term dual-phase evolution (DPE). Using this framework, we review the literature from several disciplines to show that recurrent connectivity phase transitions underlie the complex properties of many biological, physical and human systems. We argue that the DPE framework helps to explain many complex phenomena, including perpetual novelty, modularity, scale-free networks and criticality. Our review concludes with a discussion of the way DPE relates to other frameworks, in particular, self-organized criticality and the adaptive cycle.

AB  - Fish traps are widely used in Norwegian fjords, especially those designed for monitoring salmonid populations in the marine environment, although many other marine fish species are also captured. The composition and spatio-temporal variations of fish species captured by fish traps were monitored in five different coastal locations throughout the Romsdalsfjord region, Western Norway, from May to August during the three consecutive years (2011–2013). Twenty-three fish species were captured by traps in coastal waters, both resident and migratory fishes. The most common fish and with greater catchability were saithe (Pollachis virens) and sea trout (Salmo trutta), followed by cod (Gadus morhua), pollack (P. pollachius), herring (Clupea harengus) and mackerels (Trachurus trachurus and Scomber scombrus). However, the captured assemblage presented great spatial and seasonal variations, in terms of mean daily catch, probably associated with hydrographical conditions and migrational patterns. Information obtained in this study will help us to better understand the compositions and dynamic of coastal fish populations inhabiting Norwegian coastal waters. In addition, traps are highly recommended as a management tool for fish research (e.g. fish-tagging experiments, mark and recapture) and conservation purposes (coastal use and fisheries studies).

AB  - Food systems—in particular, livestock production—are key drivers of environmental change. Here, we compare the contributions of the global livestock sector in 2000 with estimated contributions of this sector in 2050 to three important environmental concerns: climate change, reactive nitrogen mobilization, and appropriation of plant biomass at planetary scales. Because environmental sustainability ultimately requires that human activities as a whole respect critical thresholds in each of these domains, we quantify the extent to which current and future livestock production contributes to published estimates of sustainability thresholds at projected production levels and under several alternative endpoint scenarios intended to illustrate the potential range of impacts associated with dietary choice. We suggest that, by 2050, the livestock sector alone may either occupy the majority of, or significantly overshoot, recently published estimates of humanity’s “safe operating space” in each of these domains. In light of the magnitude of estimated impacts relative to these proposed (albeit uncertain) sustainability boundary conditions, we suggest that reining in growth of this sector should be prioritized in environmental governance.

AB  - Many Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, populations are decreasing throughout the species' distributional range probably due to several factors acting in concert. A number of studies have documented the influence of freshwater and ocean conditions, climate variability and human impacts resulting from impoundment and aquaculture. However, most previous research has focused on analyzing single or only a few populations, and quantified isolated effects rather than handling multiple factors in conjunction. By using a multi-river mixed-effects model we estimated the effects of oceanic and river conditions, as well as human impacts, on year-to-year and between-river variability across 60 time series of recreational catch of one-sea-winter salmon (grilse) from Norwegian rivers over 29 years (1979–2007). Warm coastal temperatures at the time of smolt entrance into the sea and increased water discharge during upstream migration of mature fish were associated with higher rod catches of grilse. When hydropower stations were present in the course of the river systems the strength of the relationship with runoff was reduced. Catches of grilse in the river increased significantly following the reduction of the harvesting of this life-stage at sea. However, an average decreasing temporal trend was still detected and appeared to be stronger in the presence of salmon farms on the migration route of smolts in coastal/fjord areas. These results suggest that both ocean and freshwater conditions in conjunction with various human impacts contribute to shape interannual fluctuations and between-river variability of wild Atlantic salmon in Norwegian rivers. Current global change altering coastal temperature and water flow patterns might have implications for future grilse catches, moreover, positioning of aquaculture facilities as well as the implementation of hydropower schemes or other encroachments should be made with care when implementing management actions and searching for solutions to conserve this species.

AB  - To achieve a sustainable salmonid aquaculture industry, the environmental impacts of chemicals used to treat sea lice (Caligidae) infestations need to be considered. Our ability to assess the risks associated with these treatments in relation to human and wildlife health is limited by the lack of information on their concentrations in marine coastal environments. Diflubenzuron and teflubenzuron are chitin synthesis inhibiting insecticides frequently used to treat sea lice infestations on Norwegian salmon farms. In the present study, the distribution, persistence and bioaccumulation of both compounds were assessed in marine sediments and benthic macrofauna collected at four Norwegian aquacultures sites. Both compounds were detected in sediments sampled at 30-1400 m from the selected farms and 8-22 months after the last treatments took place. Diflubenzuron was detected above the limit of quantification (LOQ) in 76% of sediment samples and measured levels ranged between 2.4-257 µg/kg dry weight (dw). Teflubenzuron was detected above the LOQ in 92% of sediment samples, at concentrations ranging between 1.3-3474 µg/kg dw. In all samples where diflubenzuron and teflubenzuron were detected, the measured levels exceeded the Norwegian Environmental Quality Standards (EQSsediment; 0.2 and 0.0004 µg/kg dw, respectively), indicating that these compounds may pose a risk to benthic marine species living near fish farms. Both compounds were detected in wild fauna collected near the selected aquaculture sites with measured residue levels in the low micro-gram per kilogram wet weight range. The residue levels detected in economically important species caught for human consumption, such as pink shrimp (Pandalus montagui) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norwegicus), were substantially lower than biota EQS’s and maximum residue limits (MRL) set by the EU for salmon tissue. Further studies are needed to fully understand the ecological impacts of these compounds in the marine environment, with the potential for lethal and sub-lethal effects to occur in non-target organisms following chronic exposures.

AB  - In many developing countries, aquaculture is key to ensuring food security for millions of people. It is thus important to measure the full implications of environmental changes on the sustainability of aquaculture. We conduct a double meta-analysis (460 articles) to explore how global warming and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) impact aquaculture. We calculate a Multi-Antibiotic Resistance index (MAR) of aquaculture-related bacteria (11,274 isolates) for 40 countries, of which mostly low- and middle-income countries present high AMR levels. Here we show that aquaculture MAR indices correlate with MAR indices from human clinical bacteria, temperature and countries' climate vulnerability. We also find that infected aquatic animals present higher mortalities at warmer temperatures. Countries most vulnerable to climate change will probably face the highest AMR risks, impacting human health beyond the aquaculture sector, highlighting the need for urgent action. Sustainable solutions to minimise antibiotic use and increase system resilience are therefore needed.

AB  - Aquaculture is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in global food security because it may represent one of the best opportunities to increase the availability of healthy animal protein in the context of resource and environmental constraints. However, the growth and sustainability of the aquaculture industry faces important bottlenecks with respect to feed resources, which may be derived from diverse sources. Here, using a small but representative subset of potential aquafeed inputs (which we selected to highlight a range of relevant attributes), we review a core suite of considerations that need to be accommodated in concert in order to overcome key bottlenecks to the continued development and expansion of the aquaculture industry. Specifically, we evaluate the nutritional attributes, substitutability, scalability, and resource and environmental intensity of each input. On this basis, we illustrate a range of potential synergies and trade-offs within and across attributes that are characte...

AB  - Juvenile scallops of Pecten maxiumus were studied to see the capability to clear out and incorporate salmon feed and feces (30 µg L-1). Algae were also given, in a low and high concentration in addition to feed and faeces, to mimic a winter and summer situation in Norwegian waters. Rhodomonas baltica and Chaetoseris muelleri were provided in a concentration of 50 µg L-1 and 300 µg L-1. The feeding trial lasted for 27 days. Clearance rate was measured to study filtration characteristics, while fatty acid profiling and stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon were used to trace the uptake of salmon feed and feces in the digestive gland and muscle of juvenile scallops (30–35 mm shell height). The results show that the scallops could clear out and retain both salmon feed and feces particles, although at a statistically lower clearance rate than the algae. Fatty acid profiling revealed that the scallops assimilated and incorporated the consumed salmon feed and feces, given with either high or low algae concentrations, in their tissues, where the fatty acid C18:1n9 was used as a tracer fatty acid. The digestive gland of the scallops that were fed salmon feed and feces contained a higher share of C18:1n9 than those that were only fed algae. The digestive gland reflected the fatty acid composition of the diet, while the fatty acid composition of the muscle, which also changed, reflected a more complex relation between diet and metabolic processes in the tissue. The use of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to trace food sources was inconclusive in this study due to low differences between samples fed different feeds. Fatty acid profiling was a more sensitive method for tracing low concentrations of salmon feed and feces in the algae diet of scallops. Our results suggest that P. maximus could be a candidate for integrated multi trophic aquaculture (IMTA) and that scallops have the potential to utilize small particles of wasted salmon feed and feces during a winter situation with low phytoplankton concentration and during an algal bloom in Norwegian waters.

AB  - The aquaculture industry depends on the support of society to maintain and extend its activities. In Norway and elsewhere, such support cannot be taken for granted. The public has diverse expectations of the industry, and attitudes toward the industry are shaped by experiences with industry production, how the benefits and disadvantages of aquaculture production are distributed in society, and the kind and degree of information about industry issues that is available. This paper investigates public attitudes toward the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry through a nationwide survey (N = 1183). The results reveal that the public is generally positive toward the industry; they tolerate and even accept it. However, respondents had more negative perceptions regarding the environmental consequences of aquaculture production and the fairness of the distribution of economic gains. Although the industry was seen as acceptable, respondents were more reluctant in terms of welcoming production growth, which points to a need for improvement if production increase is to be realized and the industry is to be able to meet society's expectations. Our results reveal differences in attitudes between respondents living in areas with and without aquaculture, which suggest that proximity to industry is, in general, positively related to industry perceptions. However, these differences vary in size, and it can be assumed that there are substantial contextual variances within the group of respondents living in aquaculture municipalities. One potentially important influence on attitudes is related to how industry is perceived to be financially significant in a particular local community. Further research could supply these data to offer a more detailed understanding of contextual variations and thus expand on the present results that explore public perceptions and expectations of the salmon aquaculture industry.

AB  - A growing awareness of the difference between the supply and demand for fish products is fueling rapid growth of an aquaculture industry in Canada, including a freshwater sector, based mainly on the cage farming of rainbow trout. Cage farms can release relatively large loads of organic matter and nutrients to the environment. In consequence, federal and provincial resource management agencies need to develop regulatory instruments that will foster the growth of the industry while ensuring minimal water quality impacts. Such instruments should be science based, but there are currently key gaps in our understanding of the water quality implications of the operations of freshwater cage aquaculture. Here I review the state of science of the water quality implications of cage aquaculture and identify 11 knowledge gaps that currently hamper the development of sound, science-based cage culture management instruments. Perhaps the most important finding of the review is the recognition that, while aquaculture has ...

AB  - We studied the input of ammonium coming from the dissolution of food pellets commonly used in salmon farming as well as its potential for mineralization via ammonification and ammonium oxidation by natural bacterioplankton communities. Through experiments in central and southern Chile, we evaluated the potential for photo‐ and bio‐ammonification of food pellets in surface and subsurface waters (30 m depth) using irradiated (PAR + UV; IPS) and non‐irradiated dissolved‐pellet solutions (NIPS). Ammonium release was observed in both IPS and NIPS treatments and occurred at short time scales (<2 hr). Experiments in southern Chile during late winter showed high rates of pellet ammonium release in surface waters (up to 3.8 µmol L⁻¹ min⁻¹) compared with deeper samples (30 m depth). In contrast, in spring higher rates were observed at 30 m depth and reached up to 45 µmol L⁻¹ min⁻¹ while in surface waters they accounted for 9 µmol L⁻¹ min⁻¹. Ammonium oxidizing bacteria and archaea showed seasonal variability, but archaea were detected in all experiments reaching high potential activity, based in RT‐qPCR of functional genes expression copy numbers, in IPS treatments during the winter season in Chiloe. Overall, our results indicate that food pellets can be a source of ammonium, which can exceed by two orders of magnitude the average natural concentrations commonly found in the euphotic layer in coastal environments. The ammonium enrichment from dissolved pellet solutions was rapidly consumed by microbial communities including nitrifying assemblages. This has implications for the evaluation of aquaculture nutrient input and its recycling in the water column in areas highly impacted by climate change and aquaculture pressure.

AB  - Fish aquaculture for commodity production, fisheries enhancement and conservation is expanding rapidly, with many cultured species undergoing inadvertent or controlled domestication. Cultured fish are frequently released, accidentally and deliberately, into natural environments where they may survive well and impact on wild fish populations through ecological, genetic, and technical interactions. Impacts of fish released accidentally or for fisheries enhancement tend to be negative for the wild populations involved, particularly where wild populations are small, and/or highly adapted to local conditions, and/or declining. Captive breeding and supplementation can play a positive role in restoring threatened populations, but the biology of threatened populations and the potential of culture approaches for conserving them remain poorly understood. Approaches to the management of domestication and cultured-wild fish interactions are often ad hoc, fragmented and poorly informed by current science. We develop an integrative biological framework for understanding and managing domestication and cultured-wild fish interactions. The framework sets out how management practices in culture and for cultured fish in natural environments affect domestication processes, interactions between cultured and wild fish, and outcomes in terms of commodity production, fisheries yield, and conservation. We also develop a typology of management systems (specific combinations of management practices in culture and in natural environments) that are likely to provide positive outcomes for particular management objectives and situations. We close by setting out avenues for further research that will simultaneously improve fish domestication and management of cultured-wild fish interactions and provide key insights into fundamental biology.

AB  - Since 2000, an increasing number of humpback whale sightings have been recorded in northern Chilean Patagonia (mostly between 41.5°S and 44°S) from dedicated aerial and marine surveys and also opportunistic and land-based platforms during austral summer and autumn months.
Based on local knowledge from the early years of coastal whaling suggesting the historic presence of humpback whales in the area, and more recent observations confirming feeding groups, mother–calf pairs, and philopatry, it is proposed that a proportion of the eastern South Pacific humpback whales consistently use the Chiloe-Corcovado region to feed and nurse their young.
This mid-latitude area could be regarded as the northernmost feeding ground for humpback whales in South America, extending the previous known range some 1300 km north.
These findings provide further evidence for alternative life-strategies other than traditional migration and highlight the importance of northern Patagonian fjords to resolve questions that are central for large baleen whale conservation and management such as the extent and characteristics of spatio-temporal habitat use and overlap with human activities.
The need for future research on the migratory movements and population structure of this poorly understood population of humpback whales is emphasized, while an account is given of the threats they currently face.

AB  - To understand price changes, one must determine the relative impact of supply and demand shifts on price. Conditional on predetermined supply and demand elasticities, we retrieve yearly shifts in regional supply and demand. The relative impact on price from each supply and demand shift is determined through an equilibrium displacement model (EDM). This procedure is applied on a yearly basis for the world salmon market in the period 2002 to 2011. The results indicate a large variation in demand and supply growth both over time and between regions. While average annual price impacts from supply or demand shifts from most regions are not statistically significant, price impacts from supply or demand shifts for specific periods are detected in all but one region. This indicates that the use of smooth trend indicators is likely to be inappropriate for measuring supply and demand shifts and their impacts on price. The procedure presented in this article can be a useful instrument for determining the relative im...

AB  - Chile is currently the second largest producer of farmed salmon worldwide, but Flavobacterium psychrophilum, as one of the most detrimental pathogens, is responsible for major losses during the freshwater culturing step in salmonid fish farms. An antigenic study conducted 10 years ago reported four serological groups using 20 F. psychrophilum Chilean strains. To reduce disease outbreaks and to develop vaccine candidates, antigenic knowledge needs to be regularly updated using a significant number of additional recent F. psychrophilum isolates. The present study aimed at investigating the serological diversity of 118 F. psychrophilum isolates collected between 2006 and 2018 from farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The current study supports an expansion of the known antigenic groups in Chile from 4 to 14. However, the use of the slide-agglutination technique for serotyping is costly, is labour-intensive and requires significant technical expertise. Addressing these points, the mPCR-based procedure was a very useful tool for serotyping the collected Chilean F. psychrophilum isolates. This technique revealed the presence of diverse mPCR serotypes (i.e. types 0, 1, 2 and 4). Therefore, mPCR should be employed to select the bacterial strain(s) for vaccine development and to conduct follow-up, selective breeding or epidemiological surveillance in Chilean fish farms. Given the presented findings, changes to Chilean fish-farming practices are vital for ensuring the continued productivity and well-being of farmed salmonids.

AB  - Seafood is seen as promising for more sustainable diets. The increasing production in land-based closed Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RASs) has overcome many local environmental challenges with traditional open net-pen systems such as eutrophication. The energy needed to maintain suitable water quality, with associated emissions, has however been seen as challenging from a global perspective. This study uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to investigate the environmental performance and improvement potentials of a commercial RAS farm of tilapia and Clarias in Sweden. The environmental impact categories and indicators considered were freshwater eutrophication, climate change, energy demand, land use, and dependency on animal-source feed inputs per kg of fillet. We found that feed production contributed most to all environmental impacts (between 67 and 98%) except for energy demand for tilapia, contradicting previous findings that farm-level energy use is a driver of environmental pressures. The main improvement potentials include improved by-product utilization and use of a larger proportion of plant-based feed ingredients. Together with further smaller improvement potential identified, this suggests that RASs may play a more important role in a future, environmentally sustainable food system.

AB  - The cold chain is defined as a set of refrigeration steps that maintain the quality and safety of food product. Refrigerant leakage and the use of fossil fuels to produce electrical power for refrigeration equipment contribute greatly to ozone depletion and global warming. Thus, new and emerging refrigeration technologies are being developed to provide more energy efficient and environmentally friendly alternatives to current technologies. Superchilling is a concept where the temperature is reduced 1e2 C below the initial freezing point of the product. The small amount of ice formed within the product (10 e15%) serves as a heat sink, eliminating the need for ice during storage and transport. In this work, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is applied to the chilling and superchilling salmon cold chains. The superchilling cold chain presents an important improvement compared to the chilled one: diminution of about 18% of the environmental impacts. This improvement is mainly due to a better utilisation of available volume for transportation. Other solutions to increase the environmental performance (replacement/reduction of packaging material and diminution of electricity consumption during retail display) are also studied and a sensitivity analysis on the electricity grid mix of different countries is performed. © 2016 Published by

AB  - <i>Piscirickettsia salmonis</i> is the etiologic agent of piscirickettsiosis, a disease that causes significant losses in the salmon farming industry. In order to unveil the pathogenic mechanisms of <i>P. salmonis</i>, appropriate molecular and cellular studies in multiple cell lines with different origins need to be conducted. Toward that end, we established a cell viability assay that is suitable for high-throughput analysis using the alamarBlue reagent to follow the distinct stages of the bacterial infection cycle. Changes in host cell viability can be easily detected using either an absorbance- or fluorescence-based plate reader. Our method accurately tracked the infection cycle across two different Atlantic salmon-derived cell lines, with macrophage and epithelial cell properties, and zebrafish primary cell cultures. Analyses were also carried out to quantify intracellular bacterial replication in combination with fluorescence microscopy to visualize <i>P. salmonis</i> and cellular structures in fixed cells. In addition, dual gene expression analysis showed that the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα were upregulated, while the cytokines IL1b and IFNγ were downregulated in the three cell culture types. The expression of the <i>P. salmonis</i> metal uptake and heme acquisition genes, together with the toxin and effector genes <i>ospD3</i>, <i>ym</i>t, <i>pipB2</i> and <i>pepO</i>, were upregulated at the early and late stages of infection regardless of the cell culture type. On the other hand, Dot/Icm secretion system genes as well as stationary state and nutrient scarcity-related genes were upregulated only at the late stage of <i>P. salmonis</i> intracellular infection. We propose that these genes encoding putative <i>P. salmonis</i> virulence factors and immune-related proteins could be suitable biomarkers of <i>P. salmonis</i> infection. The infection protocol and cell viability assay described here provide a reliable method to compare the molecular and cellular changes induced by <i>P. salmonis</i> in other cell lines and has the potential to be used for high-throughput screenings of novel antimicrobials targeting this important fish intracellular pathogen.

Many rivers originate in the mountains, where snowfall fluctuations and the global climate’s inherent unpredictability affect the hydrological processes. Climate change sensitivity has been recognized in recent years and would affect hydropower, such as humidity, cloudiness, and precipitation, that are considered; global warming emerges as one of the most important contributors to climate change. The Yangtze River supports rich biodiversity and provides important ecosystem services for human survival and development. In addition, climate changes, particularly short-term and long-term precipitation and temperature fluctuations, influence the snow regime and the hydrological development of river flow response at the basin and sub-basin scales. More precise this review focused to understand the hydropower potential, freshwater fisheries, and hydrological response of snow dynamics in snow-dominated basins.</jats:p>

AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a foodborne bacterial pathogen that may cause gastroenteritis in humans through the consumption of seafood contaminated with this microorganism. The emergence of antimicrobial and multidrug-resistant bacteria is another serious public health threat worldwide. In this study, the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility test of V. parahaemolyticus in blood clams, shrimps, surf clams, and squids were determined. The overall prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus in seafood was 85.71% (120/140), consisting of 91.43% (32/35) in blood clam, 88.57% (31/35) in shrimps, 82.86% (29/35) in surf clams, and 80% (28/35) in squids. The majority of V. parahaemolyticus isolates from the seafood samples were found to be susceptible to most antibiotics except ampicillin, cefazolin, and penicillin. The MAR indices of V. parahaemolyticus isolates ranged from 0.04 to 0.71 and about 90.83% of isolates were found resistant to more than one antibiotic. The high prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus in seafood and multidrug-resistant isolates detected in this study could pose a potential risk to human health and hence appropriate control methods should be in place to minimize the potential contamination and prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Occupational noise is commonly encountered during aquaculture. This study documented noise levels in two buildings at a production fish hatchery, a tank room with 32, 1.8-m diameter tanks, and a rearing pavilion with 32, 6.1-m diameter tanks. With water flowing to all of the tanks in the tank room, mean noise levels were 68.4 dB, and significantly increased to 73.0 dB during tank cleaning and 73.2 dB when intermittent automatic feeders were running. The highest tank room values of 77.1 dB were recorded directly next to individual tanks during cleaning. With water flowing to all of the tanks in the rearing pavilion, mean noise levels were 70.2 dB. A significant increase to 76.1 dB was observed when the pavilion tanks were being power washed, with the highest value of 83.2 dB recorded immediately adjacent to the power washer. Although none of the noise levels exceeded regulatory limits, the use of techniques to reduce occupational noise in aquaculture environments is recommended.

AB  - Global expansion of aquaculture and agriculture facilitates disease emergence and catalyzes transmission to sympatric wildlife populations. The health of wild salmon stocks critically concerns Indigenous peoples, commercial and recreational fishers, and the general public. Despite potential impact of viral pathogens such as Piscine orthoreovirus-1 (PRV-1) on endangered wild salmon populations, their epidemiology in wild fish populations remains obscure, as does the role of aquaculture in global and local spread. Our phylogeographic analyses of PRV-1 suggest that development of Atlantic salmon aquaculture facilitated spread from Europe to the North and South East Pacific. Phylogenetic analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction surveillance further illuminate the circumstances of emergence of PRV-1 in the North East Pacific and provide strong evidence for Atlantic salmon aquaculture as a source of infection in wild Pacific salmon. PRV-1 is now an important infectious agent in critically endangered wild Pacific salmon populations, fueled by aquacultural transmission.

AB  - Aquaculture activities have introduced European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) along the coasts of some of the Canary Islands. We present the first record of simultaneous male and female gonad maturation of escaped sea bass in the wild, indicating that this species is finding its essential fish habitat (EFH). Individuals with ripe gonads were only caught during January and February 2009, although the maturation and spawning season may last from November to February in the studied area (Tenerife island). Bass infected by Sphaerospora testicularis were found and the incidence of the parasite was checked. This represents the southernmost record of the parasite, probably introduced together with sea bass stock. The results are discussed from the point of view of risk assessment and the ecology of invasions being valuable for aquaculture management in Central North Atlantic and Mediterranean areas.

AB  - Trout farming, that represents the most important sector for aquaculture inland production in Italy, can cause negative effects on aquatic ecosystems. Recently, in the framework of Water Frame Directive 2000/60/EC and national law DL 152/2006, concerning the sustainable uses of water resources, multi-criteria approaches have been suggested to evaluate the impact of fish farming on aquatic ecosystems. In this study trout farms of central Italy were selected to investigate the effects of their effluents, on receiving water bodies using a multi-criteria approach based on physicochemical parameters, microbiological and macrobenthonic indicators, detected in sampling stations located upstream/downstream the trout farm. Moreover, antibiotic susceptibility against antibiotics allowed and/or forbidden by current law (D.lgs 193/56/06) was tested on E. coli strains. The results indicate variations of chemical parameters and biological indicators from upstream to downstream sites in some of the investigated farms. Antibiotic resistance of E. coli strains suggested a large use of tetracycline and a possible past use of chloramphenicol. This study represents a first contribute to the knowledge of fish farm impacts on aquatic systems in Central Italy.

AB  - An epizootic incidence of intestinal adenocarcinomas was reported in brood fish of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in 2009. The condition was associated with a specific diet inducing enteritis and morphological changes. Here, two field trials of fish up to slaughter size were initiated. In Trial 1, two different feed recipes were used. Feed I was predominantly based on marine ingredients, whereas plant ingredients were limited to soy protein concentrate and wheat. Feed II was lower in fishmeal and without soya protein, which was substituted with plant proteins from other sources. In Trial 2, a commercial feed (Feed III) was included. No macroscopic tumours were observed in 300 fish (Trial 1). At the end of both trials, samples from five different segments of the gastrointestinal tract of a total of 39 fish were investigated with morphological methods. Here, we show the presence of ectopic proliferating epithelial cells only occurring in inflamed intestine and predominantly in the second segment of the mid-intestine. Presence of ectopic epithelial cells in submucosal inflammatory foci may indicate early stages in tumorigenesis, but other possibilities such as proliferative enteric disorders cannot be excluded. Together with inflammation, carcinogenesis should be a focus of investigation in future feed trials.

AB  - The aquaculture industry in Norway currently represents 60% (US$ 5.4 billion) of Norwegian seafood exports. Of these, farmed Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) represents over 80% (850,000 tonnes). These production levels are driven by a strong and growing demand for farmed fish, and has a stated political goal of increased growth by a factor of 5 by 2050 in Norway alone. However, growth is potentially more challenging without the public support and trust in the governance regime that regulates the industry. The theoretical framework of this paper rests on accountability theory, whereby the research team highlighted and tested the paradox between the ideal and the actual practices on a group of stakeholders representing the aquaculture industry and municipal, regional and sector management in northern Norway relative to their interactions and need thereof – versus the expectations of the public. The findings of a workshop were used to develop a conceptual model and test our theory on stakeholder driven future scenarios using a combination of systems thinking and fuzzy cognitive mapping. We found that stakeholders and management alike in a workshop setting valued flexibility of legislation and expert opinions highly, whereby regulatory standardization is not prioritized – in line with soft accountability. The industry acknowledged, though, that the public perception and negative media attention of the industry, in turn depended on hard accountability.

AB  - Due to increasing demand for salmon and environmental barriers preventing expansion in established sites, salmon farmers seek to move or expand their production to more exposed sites. In this study we investigate the effects of strong currents and waves on the behaviour of salmon and how they choose to use the space available to them. Observations are carried out in a site with strong tidal currents and well mixed water. Using video cameras and echo sounders, we show that salmon prefer to use the entire water column, narrowing their range only as a response to cage deformation, waves, or daylight. Conversely, salmon show strong horizontal preference, mostly occupying the portions of the cage exposed to currents. Additionally, waves cause salmon to disperse from the exposed side of the cage to the more sheltered side. Even when strong currents decrease the amount of available space, salmon choose to occupy the more exposed part of the cage. This indicates that at least with good water exchange, the high density caused by limited vertical space is not so aversive that salmon choose to move to less desirable areas of the cage. However, the dispersal throughout the entire available water column indicates that ensuring enough vertical space, even in strong currents, would be beneficial to salmon welfare.

AB  - Today, fish farming faces an increasing demand in fish products, but also various environmental challenges. Genetic improvement in growth rate and feed conversion ratio is known to be an efficient way to increase production and increase efficiency in fish farming. The environmental consequences of genetic improvement in growth rate and feed conversion ratio, however, are unknown. In this study, we investigated the environmental consequences of genetic improvement in growth rate and feed conversion ratio in an African catfish farm, using Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). In RAS, total fish production of the farm is limited by rearing density or by the capacity to treat dissolved nitrogen. To evaluate the environmental consequences of genetic improvement in growth rate and feed conversion ratio, we combined life cycle assessment and bioeconomic modelling of genetic response to selection. We explored different impact categories, such as climate change, eutrophication, acidification and energy use, and we expressed impacts per ton of fish produced. Results show that the environmental impact of genetic improvement in growth rate and feed conversion ratio varies among impact categories and depends on the factor limiting production at farm level (i.e. rearing density or nitrogen treatment capacity). Genetic improvement of feed conversion ratio reduces environmental impacts in each scenario tested, while improving growth rate reduces environmental impacts only when rearing density limits farm production. Environmental responses to genetic selection were generally positive and show similar trends as previously determined economic responses to genetic improvement in growth rate and feed conversion ratio in RAS. These results suggest that genetic improvement of growth rate and feed conversion ratio for species kept in RAS will benefit both the environmental impacts and the economics of the production system.

AB  - Abstract Using a unique dataset, this paper investigates factors influencing production loss in Norwegian salmonid farming. The factors can be grouped into fish-specific factors (e.g. species, genetics, and generation), input factors (e.g. vaccines and smolt quality), environmental factors (e.g. geographical location), and managerial factors (e.g. ownership). The most important result is most likely that production losses to a large extent are explainable, as our best model has an R2 as high as 0.826. This implies that it is possibile to reduce production losses significantly. For the specific factors, vaccines reduce production loss, but their effect varies by production site. Production loss also varies with which smolt plant is providing juvenile fish, indicating that there is systematic quality variation among the providers of smolt. There is also significant variation in production loss between companies and production sites, and on average production losses are lower for larger companies and sea sites holding larger numbers of fish. An important point is that while some factors explaining production loss are controlled by the individual company, others are beyond their control. Some of these external factors are related to the regulatory system.

AB  - The salmon farming industry has since its infancy witnessed immense growth due to innovations increasing productivity. A significant part of the innovations causing the productivity growth has by many observers been attributed to collaborative and open R&D-efforts. Salmon farming in Norway is very research intensive, with a large share of R&D being publicly financed, and with results widely shared and innovations widely adopted. However, in recent years there has been a shift toward an increasing share of R&D becoming privately financed, leading to more closed innovation processes. This paper explores the importance of open innovation in salmon farming and the possible consequences of more closed innovation. The paper shows that openness of the innovations depends on the type of challenge and stakeholder. Innovation is at its most open when common challenges are addressed, like finding solutions for parasites and diseases. Innovation in salmon farming tends to become more closed as the industry consolidates, the larger the firm is and the closer to the market innovation takes place.

AB  - An eclectic set of tissues and existing data, including purposely collected samples, spanning 1997–2006, was used in an ad hoc assessment of hybridization and introgression of farmed wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in the small Loch na Thull (LnT) catchment in north-west Scotland. The catchment is in an area of marine farm production and contains freshwater smolt rearing cages. The LnT S. salar stock was found to be genetically distinctive from stocks in neighbouring rivers and, despite regular reports of feral farm S. salar, there was no evidence of physical or genetic mixing. This cannot be completely ruled out, however, and low level mixing with other local wild stocks has been suggested. The LnT population appeared underpinned by relatively smaller effective number of breeders (Neb) and showed relatively low levels of genetic diversity, consistent with a small effective population size. Small sample sizes, an incomplete farm baseline and the use of non-diagnostic molecular markers, constrain the power of the analysis but the findings strongly support the LnT catchment having a genetically distinct wild S. salar population little affected by interbreeding with feral farm escapes.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to characterize the tet(X) genes, which encode a monooxygenase that catalyzes the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics, carried by the resistant strains FP105 and FP233-J200, using whole-genome sequencing analysis. The isolates were recovered from fin lesion and kidney samples of diseased rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, during two Flavobacteriosis outbreaks occurring in freshwater farms located in Southern Chile. The strains were identified as Epilithonimonas spp. by using biochemical tests and by genome comparison analysis using the PATRIC bioinformatics platform and exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxytetracycline of 128 µg/mL. The tet(X) genes were located on small contigs of the FP105 and FP233-J200 genomes. The sequences obtained for the tet(X) genes and their genetic environment were compared with the genomes available in the GenBank database of strains of the Chryseobacterium clade belonging to the Flavobacterium family, isolated from fish and carrying the tet(X) gene. The Tet(X) proteins synthesized by the Chilean Epilithonimonas strains showed a high amino acid similarity (range from 84% to 100%), with the available sequences found in strains belonging to the genus Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium isolated from fish. An identical neighborhood of tet(X) genes from both Chilean strains was observed. The genetic environment of tet(X) observed in the two strains of Epilithonimonas studied was characterized by the upstream location of a sequence encoding a hypothetical protein and a downstream located alpha/beta hydrolase-encoding gene, similar to the observed in some of the tet(X) genes carried by Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium strains isolated from fish, but the produced proteins exhibited a low amino acid identity (25-27%) when compared to these synthesized by the Chilean strains. This study reports for the first time the carriage of the tet(X) gene by the Epilithonimonas genus and their detection in fish pathogenic bacteria isolated from farmed salmonids in Chile, thus limiting the use of therapies based on oxytetracycline, the antimicrobial most widely used in Chilean freshwater salmonid farming. This results suggest that pathogenic strains of the Chryseobacterium clade occurring in Chilean salmonid farms may serve as important reservoirs of tet(X) genes.

AB  - The Muchalat Inlet, British Columbia, is among the most westerly points at which aquaculture is practiced in Canada. In this paper, we summarise data from over 18000 wild fish sampled at 16 sites over an 8 yr period, between 2004 and 2011. The most prevalent wild species was chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta (82.4%), followed by Chinook O. tshawytscha (10%) and coho O. kisutch (4.3%). However, inter-annual and seasonal variation was evident, and smaller numbers of other Pacific salmon and stickleback species were sporadically observed. A high percentage of wild salmon (~95%) had no sea lice parasites present, with less than 1% of the fish hosting a mobile-stage sea louse. Of the data for which sea lice species were recorded, just over 96% of samples were identified as Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Logistic regression models assessed the association between the presence of lice and a range of independent variables. These models indicated a significant degree of spatial variation, much of which could be explained in terms of salinity levels. There were also important variations through time, both over the season within a year and across years. In addition, coho salmon were significantly more likely (odds ratio = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.20-2.3) to be infected than chum salmon. The protective effect of low salinity was most clearly seen at values lower than 15 psu, although this was dependent on fish species.

AB  - Costs of diagnostic testing including sample collection, sampling frequency and sample size are an important consideration in the evaluation of the economic feasibility of alternative surveillance strategies for detection of infectious diseases in aquatic animals. In Chile, Piscirickettsia salmonis is the primary reason for antibiotic treatments in farmed Atlantic salmon. In 2012, a surveillance and control programme for piscirickettsiosis was established with an overall goal of reducing antibiotic use. The present study estimated the cost-effectiveness of different sampling frequencies and sample sizes to achieve at least 95% confidence of early detection of P. salmonis at the netpen and farm levels using a validated qPCR test. We developed a stochastic model that incorporated variability in test accuracy, within-pen prevalence and sampling costs. Our findings indicated that the current piscirickettsiosis surveillance programme based on risk-based sampling of five moribund or dead fish from 2 to 3 netpens is cost-effective and gives a high probability of detection of P. salmonis in Atlantic salmon farms in Chile at both the netpen and farm levels. Results from this study should incentivize salmon farmers to establish cost-effective strategies for early detection of P. salmonis infection and the application of this approach to other highly infectious diseases.

AB  - article The production of growth hormone (GH) transgenic animals has raised a host of social and scientific concerns regarding their potential impacts on ecosystems should they escape into nature. Indeed, theoretical models suggest that GH transgenic animals could, under specific conditions, decimate local populations. However, while there are numerous laboratory examinations of factors affecting survival of transgenic and wild animals, we know little about the competitive reproductive capacity of transgenic animals. Here, we examined the reproductive capabilities of cultured GH transgenic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) when in competition with wild coho derived from nature using semi-natural mating arenas (within a contained facility). To account for the well-known reproductive impairments associated with culturing salmon in laboratory facilities we contrasted the competitive reproductive success of GH transgenic coho against that of cultured non-transgenic coho. We also performed in vitro sperm analyses to assess the postcopulatory competitive ability of GH transgenic coho. In competitive mating arenas, transgenic coho performed fewer courtship and aggressive behaviours than coho from nature and sired less than 6% of offspring. Non-transgenic cultured coho, despite their smaller body size, sired more than twice as many offspring than transgenic coho when competing against wild coho in mating arenas. Transgenic males also face a postcopulatory reproductive disadvantage as their ejaculates contained fewer sperm that swam slower and for shorter durations than sperm from wild males. Together, these findings suggest limited potential for the transmission of transgenes from cultured GH transgenic coho salmon through natural matings should they escape from a contained culture facility into nature and reproductively interact with a local wild coho salmon strain. However, as responses of wild-reared fish can differ greatly from those of cultured fish, we stress the importance of understanding genotype-by-environment interactions for reproductive phenotypes when developing risk assessment information.

AB  - Purpose
As capture fishery production has reached its limits and global demand for aquatic products is still increasing, aquaculture has become the world’s fastest growing animal production sector. In attempts to evaluate the environmental consequences of this rapid expansion, life cycle assessment (LCA) has become a frequently used method. The present review of current peer-reviewed literature focusing on LCA of aquaculture systems is intended to clarify the methodological choices made, identify possible data gaps, and provide recommendations for future development within this field of research. The results of this review will also serve as a start-up activity of the EU FP7 SEAT (Sustaining Ethical Aquaculture Trade) project, which aims to perform several LCA studies on aquaculture systems in Asia over the next few years.

AB  - It is well established that a collapse or strong reduction of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) would substantially cool the northern high latitudes. Here we show that there is a possibility that such cooling could be amplified under deliberate CO<sub>2</sub> removal and result in a temporary undershoot of a targeted temperature level. We find this behaviour in Earth system models that show a strong AMOC decline in response to anthropogenic forcing. Idealized simulations of CO<sub>2</sub> removal with one of these models indicate that the timing of negative emissions relative to AMOC decline and recovery is key in setting the strength of the temporary cooling. We show that the pronounced temperature-fluctuations at high northern latitudes found in these simulations would entail considerable consequences for sea-ice and permafrost extent as well as for high latitude ecosystems.

AB  - Aquaculture poses emerging challenges for agricultural safety and health. Fish farming has many of the same hazards as other types of farming, but it also poses additional hazards associated with water impoundments and night-time work. In a multidisciplinary approach, researchers from four universities are identifying occupational hazards in fish farming and identifying no-cost or low-cost "simple solutions" to reduce or eliminate them. Simple solutions are discovered through farm visits so as to understand the countermeasures that individual stakeholders have taken to protect their workforce, and these countermeasures are documented and photographed to inform other farmers of these solutions. Equipping tractors with rollover protective structures is a standard practice to protect operators from serious injury in the event of an overturn. Other solutions identified include eliminating the need to climb feed bins to open and close the hatch for feed delivery by using a pull-cable at ground level. This simple technology eliminates the exposure to falling from an elevation, a risk that accounts for at least one reported death of a worker on a fish farm. Another solution is to replace metal paddles on a hatchery trough with plastic paddles that if and when entangled in a worker's hair or clothing slip on the rotating drive shaft and thus reduce laceration and entanglement injuries. Another simple solution to prevent entanglements in large pond aerators, used to mechanically dissolve oxygen into the water, that are operated by farm tractor power take-off shafts is to use electrically powered aerators. Bubble-type aerators are safer than electrically powered paddle aerators because workers are shielded from moving parts. Many additional simple solutions have been identified for a range of tasks in this environment.

AB  - Aquaculture continues to be the fastest-growing food production sector with great potential to meet projected protein needs. The scientific and business communities are responding to the challenges and opportunities inherent in the * Corresponding author: Craig.Browdy@novusint.com Global Conference on Aquaculture 2010 – Farming the Waters for People and Food 150 growing aquaculture sector with research efforts generating novel technologies that mirror the diversity of the industry. In genetics and breeding, the pace of advancement and innovation has been increasing exponentially. The number of breeding programmes, diversity of species, target traits and efficiency and sophistication of techniques applied continues to expand and advance. However, the pace of scientific development has at times outdistanced our ability to analyze risks and benefits, develop appropriate culture and containment technologies, educate and communicate, and reach policy and regulatory consensus. Now, more than ever, efforts must be made for society to accurately analyze and understand risks, to capture opportunities to raise healthier aquatic organisms faster with less environmental impact, while improving economic stability and providing associated social benefits. Disease outbreaks continue to constrain aquaculture sustainability. Improvements in aquatic animal and plant health are coming from new technologies, improved management strategies and better understanding of the genetic and physiological basis of immunity. Vaccine development is benefiting from better specific antigen determination, more efficacious adjuvants and enhanced vaccine delivery. Traditional diagnostic technologies and newer methods have greatly improved speed, specificity and sensitivity. Research on improving oral delivery and disease management strategies that focus on prevention offer opportunities for improved control of pathogens and parasites in the future, obviating the use of antibiotics and chemotherapeutants. An important key to culture of any fed species is the development of sustainable, cost-effective and nutritionally complete feeds, along with efficient feed management systems. Current research is focusing on improved understanding of nutritional requirements, nutrient availabilities and cost-effective formulations designed to maximize food conversion efficiency. Continuing cost pressures and the acute need to find additional protein and lipid sources to augment limited fishmeal and fish oil supplies is driving an increased understanding of how different nutrients are utilized and how to use increasing amounts of terrestrial ingredients. New sources of proteins and lipids from algae and microbes can offer alternatives, as cost efficiencies improve. Use of enzymes, probiotics and prebiotics, phytogenic compounds and organic acids are being shown to change gut microflora and improve health, digestibility and performance. Improved pelleting and extrusion technologies allow the production of top-quality feeds. Advancements in production systems, including recirculation technologies, cages and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, are also contributing to industry expansion and sustainability. All of these production system technologies are benefitting from expanding information and communication systems which are enabling advances in every stage of production. These and other examples

AB  - Animal welfare is an essential component of the future of sustainable agriculture and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. There is growing global recognition of the importance of animal welfare, which must always be considered as part of the decision-making around food and nutrition security. Veterinary Services, encompassing public and private veterinarians and para-veterinarians, are custodians of animal welfare and key players in future actions to improve it. The welfare of animals is everyone's responsibility, from the individual farmer and practitioner to policymakers at the national and intergovernmental level. In this paper, after providing background information about current animal welfare issues and identifying animal welfare risks, the authors make a number of recommendations for action at the institutional and individual level. They do so because while the former is essential to generate change at scale and effective resourcing, the latter can create immediate action at a local level and drive change from the ground up. Without coordinated action from Veterinary Services, opportunities to improve animal welfare, alongside human and environmental health and well-being, may very well be lost, and animal welfare may fail to improve or even be at risk of decline.

AB  - Reduction of the environmental impact of feed products is of paramount importance for salmon farming. This article explores the potential to compare three thermodynamically based ecological indicators. The environmental impact of partial replacement of fish meal (FM) and fish oil with alternative ingredients was investigated using energy, classical exergy and eco-exergy analysis. Seven hypothetical feeds were formulated: one with high levels of FM and fish oil, four feeds based on plant ingredients, one containing krill meal, and one based on algae-derived products. Analysis included cultivation of crops and algae, fishing for fish and krill, industrial processing of these ingredients and production of complete fish feed. Because most harvested products are refined in multiple product outputs that have good value to society, two scenarios were compared. In the base case scenario, no allocation of co-products was used and all the environmental costs were ascribed to one specific co-product. Co-product allocation by mass was used in the second scenario; this is considered to be the preferred scenario because it accurately reflects the individual contributions of the co-products to the environmental impact of the feed products. For this scenario, the total energy consumption for a fish-based diet was 14,500 MJ, which was similar to a krill diet (15,600 MJ), about 15–31% higher than plant-based diets, and 9% higher than an algae diet. Substituting FM and fish oil with alternative ingredients resulted in minor changes in total classical exergy degradation (2–16% difference). The calculations based on energy only consider the energy conservation based on the First Law of Thermodynamics, whereas those based on classical exergy also takes the Second Law of Thermodynamics into account; energy that can do work is distinguished from energy that is lost as heat to the environment. The calculations based on eco-exergy consider the total loss of work energy in the environment including the work energy associated with the information embodied in the genomes of organisms. The diet based on fishery-derived ingredients was the highest total work energy consumer compared with plant-based diets (24–30% greater), the diet containing krill meal (25% greater), and the algae diet (four times higher). Thus, reducing FM and fish oil levels in fish feed can contribute significantly to more sustainable aquaculture. In particular, algae-derived products in aquafeeds could drastically decrease environmental costs in the future.

AB  - <i>Piscine orthoreovirus</i> (PRV) is a pathogen that causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation in <i>Salmo salar</i> and has also been linked to circulatory disorders in other farmed salmonids, such as <i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i> and <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>. The virus has a segmented, double-stranded RNA genome, which makes it possible to undergo genetic reassortment and increase its genomic diversity through point mutations. In this study, genetic reassortment in PRV was assessed using the full genome sequences available in public databases. This study used full genome sequences that were concatenated and genome-wide reassortment events, and phylogenetic analyses were performed using the recombination/reassortment detection program version 5 (RDP5 V 5.5) software. Additionally, each segment was aligned codon by codon, and overall mean distance and selection was tested using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis X software, version 10.2 (MEGA X version 10.2). The results showed that there were 17 significant reassortment events in 12 reassortant sequences, involving genome exchange between low and highly virulent genotypes. PRV sequences from different salmonid host species did not appear to limit the reassortment. This study found that PRV frequently undergoes reassortment events to increase the diversity of its segmented genome, leading to antigenic variation and increased virulence. This study also noted that to date, no reassortment events have been described between PRV-1 and PRV-3 genotypes. However, the number of complete genomic sequences within each genotype is uneven. This is important because PRV-3 induces cross-protection against PRV-1, making it a potential vaccine candidate.

AB  - Piscirickettsia salmonis, the etiological agent of the Salmon Rickettsial Septicemia (SRS), is one the most serious health problems for the Chilean salmon industry. Typical antimicrobial strategies used against P. salmonis include antibiotics and vaccines, but these applications have largely failed. A few years ago, the first attenuated-live vaccine against SRS (ALPHA JECT LiVac® SRS vaccine) was released to the market. However, there is no data about the agents involved in the activation of the immune response induced under field conditions. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the expression profile of a set of gene markers related to innate and adaptive immunity in the context of a cellular response in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reared under productive farm conditions and immunized with a live-attenuated vaccine against P. salmonis. We analyzed the expression at zero, 5-, 15- and 45-days post-vaccination (dpv). Our results reveal that the administration of the attenuated live SRS LiVac vaccine induces a short-term upregulation of the cellular-mediated immune response at 5 dpv modulated by the upregulation of ifnα, ifnγ, and the cd4 and cd8α T cell surface markers. In addition, we also registered the upregulation of il-10 and tgfβ. Altogether, the results suggest that a balanced activation of the immune response took place only at early times post-vaccination (5 dpv). The scope of this short-term upregulation of the cellular-mediated immune response against a natural outbreak in fish subjected to productive farm conditions deserves further research.

AB  - Livestock, particularly ruminants, can eat a wider range of biomass than humans. In the drive for greater efficiency, intensive systems of livestock production have evolved to compete with humans for high-energy crops such as cereals. Feeds consumed by livestock were analysed in terms of the quantities used and efficiency of conversion of grassland, human-edible ('edible') crops and crop by-products into milk, meat and eggs, using the United Kingdom as an example of a developed livestock industry. Some 42 million tonnes of forage dry matter were consumed from 2008 to 2009 by the UK ruminant livestock population of which 0.7 was grazed pasture and 0.3 million tonnes was conserved forage. In addition, almost 13 million tonnes of raw material concentrate feeds were used in the UK animal feed industry from 2008 to 2009 of which cereal grains comprised 5.3 and soyabean meal 1.9 million tonnes. The proportion of edible feed in typical UK concentrate formulations ranged from 0.36 for milk production to 0.75 for poultry meat production. Example systems of livestock production were used to calculate feed conversion ratios (FCR - feed input per unit of fresh product). FCR for concentrate feeds was lowest for milk at 0.27 and for the meat systems ranged from 2.3 for poultry meat to 8.8 for cereal beef. Differences in FCR between systems of meat production were smaller when efficiency was calculated on an edible input/output basis, where spring-calving/grass finishing upland suckler beef and lowland lamb production were more efficient than pig and poultry meat production. With the exception of milk and upland suckler beef, FCR for edible feed protein into edible animal protein were >1.0. Edible protein/animal protein FCR of 1.0 may be possible by replacing cereal grain and soyabean meal with cereal by-products in concentrate formulations. It is concluded that by accounting for the proportions of human-edible and inedible feeds used in typical livestock production systems, a more realistic estimate of efficiency can be made for comparisons between systems.

AB  - In the present study, salmon products available from UK retailers were analysed to determine the levels of n-3 long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA), a key determinant of nutritional quality. There was a wide variation in the proportions and absolute contents of EPA and DHA in the products. Relatively high contents of 18 : 1n-9, 18 : 2n-6 and 18 : 3n-3, characteristic of vegetable oils (VO), were found in several farmed salmon products, which also had generally lower proportions of EPA and DHA. In contrast, farmed salmon products with higher levels of 16 : 0 and 22 : 1, characteristic of fish oil (FO), had higher proportions of EPA and DHA. Therefore, there was a clear correlation between the levels of VO and FO in feeds and the proportions of n-3 LC-PUFA in products. Although wild salmon products were characterised by higher proportions of n-3 LC-PUFA (20-40%) compared with farmed fish (9-26%), they contained lower total lipid contents (1-6% compared with 7-17% in farmed salmon products). As a result, farmed salmon products invariably had higher levels of n-3 LC-PUFA in absolute terms (g/100 g fillet) and, therefore, delivered a higher 'dose' of EPA and DHA per portion. Overall, despite the finite and limiting supply of FO and increasing use of VO, farmed salmon continue to be an excellent source of and delivery system for n-3 LC-PUFA to consumers.

AB  - Abstract Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous marine and freshwater sediment contaminants. Extensive data exist to confirm that PAHs are toxic to aquatic receptors. However, limited information is available regarding the bioavailability and genotoxicity of sediment PAHs to aquatic organisms. This study investigated an integrated biomonitoring approach using chemical analyses and biomarkers to characterize the bioavailability and genotoxicity of a complex PAH mixture in freshwater lake sediments associated with a former manufactured gas plant (MGP). Sediment PAH genotoxicity was assessed by flow cytometry (FCM), DNA adduct 32 P-postlabeling, and erythrocyte micronuclei in juvenile coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) caged in the water column. Significant PAH-induced genotoxicity was observed with FCM and 32 P-postlabeling, but not with erythrocyte micronuclei. Chromosome damage in peripheral blood and hepatic DNA adducts correlated with sediment, but not water column PAH concentrations. Total hepatic DNA adducts in salmon caged nearest the former MGP facility was 39±6.5 (RAL×10 9 ), while salmon caged in a reference lake had 28±2.3 total hepatic DNA adducts per 10 9 nucleotides. These results indicate that in situ biomonitoring using biomarkers and caged fish can be a sensitive indicator of genotoxic PAHs in sediments.

AB  - The applications of nanoparticles (Nps) as food additives, health enhancers, and antimicrobials in animal production are increasing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of selenium (Se) nanoparticles (Se<sup>0</sup>Nps) stabilized with L-cysteine (Se<sup>0</sup>Nps/L-Cys), as a nutritional supplement, on immunological, oxidative status, and productive parameters in <i>O. mykiss.</i> TEM and SEM-EDS showed the accumulation of spherical Se<sup>0</sup>Nps entirely composed by elemental selenium (Se<sup>0</sup>) as intracellular and extracellular deposits in <i>Pantoea agglomerans</i> UC-32 strain. The in vitro antioxidant capacity of Se<sup>0</sup>Nps/L-Cys was significant more efficient ROS scavengers than Se<sup>0</sup>Nps and Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>. We also evaluate the effect of Se<sup>0</sup>Nps/L-Cys on cell viability and oxidative stress in RTgill-W1, RTS-11, or T-PHKM <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i> cell lines. Se<sup>0</sup>Nps/L-Cys showed less toxic and high antioxidant activity than Se<sup>0</sup>Nps and Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>. Finally, the dietary Se<sup>0</sup>Nps/L-Cys had a significant better effect on both plasma lysozyme and respiratory burst activity (innate immune response), on tissular Gpx activity (oxidative status), and on well-being (productive parameter) of <i>O. mykiss</i> when it is compared to Se<sup>0</sup>Nps and Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>. Se<sup>0</sup>Nps/L-Cys is a promising alternative for nutritional supplement for <i>O. mykiss</i> with better performance than Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> and Se<sup>0</sup>Nps, ease to implementation, and reduced environmental impact.

AB  - The region of the fjords, channels, and islands of Chilean Patagonia (41° 42'S 73° 02'W; 56° 29'S 68° 44'W) has one of the most rugged coasts and is one of the least studied marine systems worldwide. Over the last two decades, we have collected samples (diving down to 35 m) at more than 500 stations, taken underwater photographs, recorded videos from remotely operated vehicles and carried out a comprehensive literature review on benthic (hard bottom) macroinvertebrates and macroalgae. Based on this research, we propose a subdivision of Chilean Patagonia into three biogeographical provinces and 13 ecoregions. The inventory developed indicates the occurrence of rich and extensive sublittoral associations formed by 13 bioengineering species, conforming 11 types of submarine invertebrates, and two types of macroalgal forests. According to the national inventory of wildlife species by conservation status, six of the invertebrate species thriving in Patagonia belong to one of the categories of threatened species. The main local threats to these habitat-forming species are aquaculture, infrastructure and industrialization projects, fishing, and invertebrate harvesting, as well as threats from climate change and volcanic activities. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for the protection and conservation of the biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by these species’ associations.

AB  - <jats:p>The regulation of aquaculture production in Norway considers the potential impact of salmon lice on wild fish. However, most attention has been focused on impacts on wild Atlantic salmon, despite the fact that anadromous brown trout spend the majority of their marine phase in coastal waters, where salmon lice have the highest impact. In the present study, we first suggest changes in marine living area and marine feeding time as sustainability indicators for first-time migrant sea trout, as high salmon lice densities may exclude sea trout from otherwise usable habitat and force them to return early to freshwater. Further, a method based on a bio-hydrodynamic model was developed to serve as a proxy for these indicators. The method accounted for the size, migration timing and spatial extent of sea trout and was demonstrated in 2 Norwegian salmon aquaculture production areas, Hardangerfjord (PO3) and Romsdalsfjord (PO5), and 2 focal rivers from within each fjord. Based on these comparisons, we exemplify how the change in marine living area and marine feeding time differed between PO3 and PO5 and within the areas. Sea trout migrating to sea late (June 5) were always more affected by lice than those migrating early (April 24) or at intermediate dates (May 15). Our estimates revealed dramatic potential impacts of salmon lice on sea trout populations, which were greatly influenced by spatial and temporal aspects. Considering the negative impacts of salmon lice on sea trout, a holistic view of environmental interactions between aquaculture and wild species that depend on habitats exploited for production is necessary.</jats:p>

AB  - Carbohydrates can both protect against infection and act as targets promoting infection. Mucins are major components of the slimy mucus layer covering the fish epithelia. Mucins can act as decoys for intimate pathogen interaction with the host afforded by binding to glycosphingolipids in the host cell membrane. We isolated and characterized glycosphingolipids from Atlantic salmon skin, gill, stomach, pyloric caeca, and intestine. We characterized the glycosphingolipids using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry and the glycan repertoire was compared with the glycan repertoire of mucins from the same epithelia. We also investigated <i>Aeromonas salmonicida</i> binding using chromatogram and microtiter well based binding assays. We identified 29 glycosphingolipids. All detected acid glycans were of the ganglio-series (unless shorter) and showed a high degree of polysialylation. The non-acid glycans were mostly composed of the neolacto, globo, and ganglio core structures. The glycosphingolipid repertoire differed between epithelia and the proportion of the terminal moieties of the glycosphingolipids did not reflect the terminal moieties on the mucins from the same epithelia. <i>A. salmonicida</i> did not bind the Atlantic salmon glycosphingolipids. Instead, we identified that <i>A. salmonicida</i> binding to sialic acid occurred to α2-6 Neu5Ac but not to α2-3 Neu5Ac. α2-6 Neu5Ac was present on mucins whereas mainly α2-3 Neu5Ac was found on the glycosphingolipids, explaining the difference in <i>A. salmonicida</i> binding ability between these host glycoconjugates. <i>A. salmonicida´s</i> ability to bind to Atlantic salmon mucins, but not the glycosphingolipids, is likely part of the host defence against this pathogen.

AB  - Many industries are required to monitor themselves in meeting regulatory policies intended to protect the environment. Self-reporting of environmental performance can place the cost of monitoring on companies rather than taxpayers, but there are obvious risks of bias, often addressed through external audits or inspections. Surprisingly, there have been relatively few empirical analyses of bias in industry self-reported data. Here, we test for bias in reporting of environmental compliance data using a unique data set from Canadian salmon farms, where companies monitor the number of parasitic sea lice on fish in open sea pens, in order to minimize impacts on wild fish in surrounding waters. We fit a hierarchical population-dynamics model to these sea-louse count data using a Bayesian approach. We found that the industry's monthly counts of two sea-louse species, Caligus clemensi and Lepeophtheirus salmonis, increased by a factor of 1.95 (95% credible interval: 1.57, 2.42) and 1.18 (1.06, 1.31), respectively, in months when counts were audited by the federal fisheries department. Consequently, industry sea-louse counts are less likely to trigger costly but mandated delousing treatments intended to avoid sea-louse epidemics in wild juvenile salmon. These results highlight the potential for combining external audits of industry self-reported data with analyses of their reporting to maintain compliance with regulations, achieve intended conservation goals, and build public confidence in the process.

AB  - In a world where the population continues to increase and the volume of fishing catches stagnates or even falls, the aquaculture sector has great growth potential. This study aimed to contribute to the depth of knowledge of the diversity of bacterial species found in Sparus aurata collected from a fish farm and to understand which profiles of diminished susceptibility to antibiotics would be found in these bacteria that might be disseminated in the environment. One hundred thirty-six bacterial strains were recovered from the S. aurata samples. These strains belonged to Bacillaceae, Bacillales Family XII. Incertae Sedis, Comamonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Erwiniaceae, Micrococcaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Staphylococcaceae families. Enterobacter sp. was more frequently found in gills, intestine and skin groups than in muscle groups (p ≤ 0.01). Antibiotic susceptibility tests found that non-susceptibility to phenicols was significantly higher in gills, intestine and skin samples (45%) than in muscle samples (24%) (p ≤ 0.01) and was the most frequently found non-susceptibility in both groups of samples. The group of Enterobacteriaceae from muscles presented less decreased susceptibility to florfenicol (44%) than in the group of gills, intestine and skin samples (76%). We found decreased susceptibilities to β-lactams and glycopeptides in the Bacillaceae family, to quinolones and mupirocin in the Staphylococcaceae family, and mostly to β-lactams, phenicols and quinolones in the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae families. Seven Enterobacter spp. and five Pseudomonas spp. strains showed non-susceptibility to ertapenem and meropenem, respectively, which is of concern because they are antibiotics used as a last resort in serious clinical infections. To our knowledge, this is the first description of species Exiguobacterium acetylicum, Klebsiella michiganensis, Lelliottia sp. and Pantoea vagans associated with S. aurata (excluding cases where these bacteria are used as probiotics) and of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnrB19-producing Leclercia adecarboxylata strain. The non-synonymous G385T and C402A mutations at parC gene (within quinolone resistance-determining regions) were also identified in a Klebsiella pneumoniae, revealing decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. In this study, we found not only bacteria from the natural microbiota of fish but also pathogenic bacteria associated with fish and humans. Several antibiotics for which decreased susceptibility was found here are integrated into the World Health Organization list of "critically important antimicrobials" and "highly important antimicrobials" for human medicine.

AB  - Abstract This study addresses the risk and vulnerability of Chilean salmon production to hazards resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic threat, including limited access to farms, limited processing capacity and reduced market demand. The role of different management approaches in reducing risk and vulnerability is also explored. Results suggest that concession areas having the largest accumulated and current biomass have the highest risk, which is also transferred to the municipal level. The scenarios modelled with better management practices that reduce diseases were able to reduce risks by 30–40%. The largest risk reduction is achieved when production biomass is divided in a more equitable manner among concession areas, suggesting the need for strategic improvements in spatial planning of the activity in the marine environment according to ecosystem carrying capacity and better practices. Improving adaptation capacity can reduce vulnerability between 20% and 30% for municipalities; for example, providing local employment can be a win-win management measure under the COVID-19 threat because it reduces movement of people and facilitates handling and responses to emergencies. A larger footprint in local economies and employment can also improve social perception and acceptance of the sector, thus contributing to improve adaptation changes and governance to face the threats. The framework used here to perform a risk and vulnerability assessment of salmon farming to the pandemic-associated threats can also be useful for other aquaculture systems elsewhere, provided that relevant information is available.

AB  - Conventional open netcage systems for salmon aquaculture are under scrutiny and criticism partially because they are believed to generate adverse environmental impacts on other resource users and the surrounding environment. One alternative to preventing or miniming these impacts is to use enclosed systems. Experience indicates that these enclosed systems are technically feasible and environmentally promising, but they are economically demanding because of high capital and operating costs. Therefore, an economic analysis of open netcage and sea-bag systems for salmon aquaculture was conducted to examine the profitability of salmon aquaculture operations between these two systems. The study shows that netcage systems are more financially profitable than sea-bag systems when environmental costs are either not or only partially considered. Sea-bag systems can be financially profitable only when they produce fish that achieve a price premium. Sensitivity analyses reveal that market price has the most importan...

AB  - Purpose




The world’s population is expected to increase by 30 percent to 10bn people by 2050 and with 70 percent of the earth’s surface covered by water aquaculture will play an important role in producing food for the future. The paper aims to discuss this issue.




Design/methodology/approach




While Canada has the longest coastline in the world by far (202,080 km) with 80,000 km of marine coastline capable of supporting aquaculture and fisheries, it ranks only 25th in terms of world aquaculture production. The reasons are many and varied, and this review examines statistical reports and publications to trace the beginnings of the aquaculture sector in Canada, and highlights some areas of strength and potential, and the challenges for future growth and expansion.




Findings




Currently, less than 1 percent of the 3.8m hectares of freshwater and marine areas that are considered suitable for seafood (i.e. finfish, shellfish and aquatic plants) production are being farmed so Canada has an ocean of opportunity to be a leader in world aquaculture production in the future.




Originality/value




The review highlights the need for a national strategic plan to increase aquaculture production in Canada and the need to simplify the current complex regulatory framework that has resulted in significant uncertainties and delays that have limited growth in this sector. The review highlights the potential and interest to triple current production while fostering greater involvement of First Nation communities.

AB  - This chapter focusses on the way aquaculture interacts with other users of the coastal zone, and specifically the side effects (externalities) of these interactions. The DPSIR (Driving forces - Pressure - State - Impact - Response) paradigm is used here to explore the externalities problem and to suggest policy solutions. Two aspects of the problem are considered, on the one hand those externalities generated by coastal zone activities that affect aquaculture, and on the other those originating from aquaculture itself. Monetary valuation is one way to assess externalities, and an example is provided for shrimp farming in mangroves (see appendix). The benefits and risks of different strategies for policy solutions based on assessments of externali- ties are discussed.

AB  - <jats:p>Market-based approaches to seafood sustainability have gained popularity in the last decade. Market-based tools, such as certification and ratings systems, enable seafood companies along supply chains to engage in sustainability initiatives while reducing business risks. Yet, these approaches are predominantly utilized in Global North markets and often evaluate performance against standards that build upon resource-intensive, mainstream fisheries management models. These management models have yielded successful outcomes in industrial fisheries, mainly in the Global North, where science, management, and compliance authorities are well-resourced. In contrast, artisanal and small-scale fisheries in the Global South have seen limited success in applying mainstream management approaches. Co-management approaches based on secure tenure rights, which emphasize effective partnerships between management authorities and resource users with specific rights over the resources, have shown better outcomes in these contexts. Despite this, market-based tools have largely overlooked co-management principles and tenure rights in their standards. To address this gap, this paper introduces two step-wise evaluative methods designed for the ratings system FishSource, aiming to score whether fishers enjoy secure tenure rights and effectively participate in decision making. The proposed methods use available secondary data to evaluate these crucial aspects of well-managed and equitable small-scale fisheries, while aligning with international policy instruments like the Food and Agriculture Organization Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>

AB  - Agricultural practice of the world in last decades has proved that simplistic intensification of agriculture systems has paid high prices while increasing crop production and production efficiency. Therefore, sustainable intensification should be a pattern for the development of aquaculture. The goal of sustainable development of aquaculture systems can be achieved through the ecological intensification, that is, integrating anthropogenic inputs with aquaculture ecosystem services. This chapter will introduce the multidimensionality of aquaculture systems, and the relationships of intensification degree with economic efficiency and ecological footprints, so that we can better understand the sustainability of aquaculture systems and the future development pattern of aquaculture industry.

AB  - Concern has been voiced in recent years regarding the environmental implications of the Antarctic krill fishery. Attention has focused primarily on ecological concerns, whereas other environmental aspects, including potentially globally problematic emissions and material and energy demands, have not been examined in detail. Here we apply life cycle assessment to measure the contributions of krill meal, oil, and omega-3 capsules to global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, energy use, and biotic resource use. Supply chains of one krill fishing and processing company, Aker BioMarine of Norway, were assessed. Impacts of krill products were found to be driven primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels onboard the fishing vessel and a transport/resupply vessel. Approximately 190 L of fuel are burned per tonne of raw krill landed, markedly higher than fuel inputs to reduction fisheries targeting other species. In contrast, the biotic resource use associated with extracting krill is relati...

AB  - The paper seeks to contribute to the expanding literature on ecosystem service assessment by considering its integration with economic analyses of such services. Focussing upon analyses for future orientated policy and decision making, we initially consider a single period during which ecological stocks are maintained at sustainable levels. The flow of ecosystems services and their contribution to welfare bearing goods is considered and methods for valuing resultant benefits are reviewed and illustrated via a case study of land use change. We then broaden our time horizon to discuss the treatment of future costs and benefits. Finally we relax our sustainability assumption and consider economic approaches to the incorporation of depleting ecological assets with a particular focus upon stocks which exhibit thresholds below which restoration is compromised.

AB  - Summary

Atlantic salmon have been reared in the British Columbia, Canada aquaculture industry since the early 1980s. No breeding programmes spanned the entire production period and pedigree records were not kept for broodstocks prior to or since importation. Of the three recognized industry strains, two are of European ancestry (‘Mowi’ from Norway and ‘McConnell’ from Scotland) and one is of North American heritage (‘Cascade’ from Gaspe, Quebec). We evaluated the amount and distribution of genetic variation within industry broodstocks by surveying microsatellite variation at 11 loci in 20 broodstock groups sampled from major production facilities. Allelic richness averaged 10.9 (range 5.8–13.8), compared with a value of 20.3 obtained for a North American wild population. Pairwise genetic distances (DS) between samples within strains were generally less than those between strains, with samples attributed to the same strain clustering together in a neighbour-joining dendrogram. Nevertheless, average distances between samples within the European strains were high (0.41 for Mowi; 0.71 for McConnell) but lower (0.06) for the Cascade strain. The reduced intra-sample and increased intra-strain genetic variation observed for the BC domesticated samples compared with wild populations was similar to observations for European domesticated Atlantic salmon. Evidence of introgression of the Cascade strain into European broodstocks was provided by the presence of large Ssa202 alleles (confined to North America in wild populations) in some Mowi and McConnell samples. Introgression likely also contributed to the decreased intercontinental genetic distance for the domesticated samples of this study compared with that observed for wild populations.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota of certain farmed fish are often exposed to antimicrobial substances, such as antibiotics, that are used to prevent and treat bacterial diseases. Antibiotics that kill or inhibit the growth of harmful microbes can rapidly alter intestinal microbial diversity and composition, with potential effects on the host health. In this study, we have elucidated the impact of two antibiotics, florfenicol and oxolinic acid, by employing a high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique on the distal and mid intestinal microbial communities of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). For this, Atlantic salmon were offered diets with or without antibiotics. We then investigated the bacterial communities in the intestinal mucus of the fish. Our results showed that antibiotic exposure shifts the intestinal microbial profile differentially. In addition, the bacterial compositions of the control and antibiotic-fed groups were significantly different. Antibiotic feeding altered the composition and abundance of the dominant bacterial phyla, namely Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, and Thermotogae. The bacterial association network analysis also indicated the differential pattern of co-occurrence of bacteria in the three study groups. The results regarding the differences in the structure and association of the intestinal microbiota of Atlantic salmon after florfenicol and oxolinic acid feeding can be employed to attenuate the adverse effects of antibiotic feeding on fish.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Global aquaculture production has grown very rapidly in recent decades. This is largely due to a number of innovations that has increased the control with the production process and competitiveness. These innovations come in a number of forms from radical new concepts to knowledge adaption from the terrestrial food production system. While there exist a number of studies investigating the impact of specific innovations, there are few studies that take a larger perspective on how innovations over time impacts an aquaculture industry or the innovation system that support these innovations. In this paper we review the innovation process in Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry from its infancy in 1970 until present. Of particular interest is the increasing complexity of the industry, and how most innovations are conducted by suppliers and not the aquaculture producers themselves. The insights are also of general interest in global aquaculture as salmon is among the species with the most advanced production technologies, but also a species where innovations are adapted to other species also in very different production systems.</jats:p>

AB  - Resistance to carbapenems in human pathogens is a growing clinical and public health concern. The carbapenems are in an antimicrobial class considered last-resort, they are used to treat human infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales, and they are classified by the World Health Organization as 'High Priority Critically Important Antimicrobials'. The presence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CREs) of animal-origin is of concern because targeted studies of Canadian retail seafood revealed the presence of carbapenem resistance in a small number of Enterobacterales isolates. To further investigate this issue, a risk profile was developed examining shrimp and salmon, the two most important seafood commodities consumed by Canadians and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, a member of the Enterobacterales order. Carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli</i> (CREc) isolates have been identified in shrimp and other seafood products. Although carbapenem use in aquaculture has not been reported, several classes of antimicrobials are utilised globally and co-selection of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms in an aquaculture setting is also of concern. CREs have been identified in retail seafood purchased in Canada and are currently thought to be uncommon. However, data concerning CRE or CREc occurrence and distribution in seafood are limited, and argue for implementation of ongoing or periodic surveillance.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In France, rainbow trout (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</jats:italic>) farming traditionally used flow-through systems, which raised concerns about environmental impacts, including limited freshwater availability, and the use of ingredients from intensive agriculture and fishing. To address the growing demand for sustainable food products, there is an increasing interest in organic aquaculture. In this study, we employed an attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) to analyse the environmental impacts of rainbow trout production. We simulated conventional and organic production practices in a hypothetical fish farm to evaluate the differences in environmental impacts at the farm level. The potential impacts were calculated using a product-based functional unit (one tonne of trout) under the two production scenarios and were also expressed using a surface-based functional unit (m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>y). Our life cycle impact assessment revealed that organic farming significantly reduced environmental impacts per tonne of trout in seven out of the nine selected impact categories. Notably, freshwater ecotoxicity exhibited the greatest difference, with organic systems showing a 55% decrease. The only exceptions were freshwater eutrophication and water dependence, where organic production led to higher impacts per tonne of trout. In conventional farming, emissions amounted to 14 kg of P eq./tonne, whereas in organic farming, the emissions were slightly higher (15 kg of P eq./tonne). For water dependence, one tonne of trout production in the conventional system mobilized 128 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>vs. 185 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>in the organic system. The environmental benefits of organic production were even more marked when using a surface-based functional unit (m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>y). We demonstrated the benefits of organic trout production from an environmental perspective. However, our findings highlight the caution needed when interpreting LCA comparisons of such production systems that can be highly influenced by methodological choices such as the functional unit used.</jats:p>

AB  - Large amounts of antimicrobials are used in salmonid aquaculture in Chile. Most are used in marine aquaculture, but appreciable amounts are also employed in freshwater aquaculture. Much research and many publications have examined transferable antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from marine salmon farms, but much less attention has been paid to this area in freshwater salmon farming. A recent paper by Dominguez et al. (2019) has as least in part remedied this situation. We now comment on some of its interpretations and have attempted to point out its areas of strength and weakness in light of the published scientific literature. Seen in this setting, the important results presented by Dominguez et al. (2019) underline the need for increased awareness of the challenge to animal and human health posed by excessive use of antimicrobials in aquaculture.

AB  - Caligus rogercresseyi is a copepod ectoparasite with a high prevalence in salmon farms in Chile, causing severe welfare and economic concerns to the sector. Information on the parasite’s underpinning mechanisms to support its life strategy is recently being investigated. Due to the critical role of microbiota, this study aimed to characterize the microbiota community associated with C. rogercresseyi from different regions with salmon aquaculture in Chile. Using third-generation sequencing with Nanopore technology (MinION) the full 16S rRNA gene from sea lice obtained from 8 areas distributed over the three main aquaculture regions were sequenced. Microbiota of the parasite is mainly comprised of members of phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and a core microbiota community with 147 taxonomical features was identified, and it was present in sea lice from the three regions. This community accounted for 19% of total identified taxa but more than 70% of the total taxonomical abundance, indicating a strong presence in the parasite. Several taxa with bioactive compound secretory capacity were identified, such as members of genus Pseudoalteromonas and Dokdonia, suggesting a possible role of the lice microbiota during the host infestation processes. Furthermore, the microbiota community was differentially associated with the salmon production, where several potential pathogens such as Vibrio, Tenacibaculum, and Aeromonas in Los Lagos, Aysen, and Magallanes region were identified. Notably, the Chilean salmon industry was initially established in the Los Lagos region but it’s currently moving to the south, where different oceanographic conditions coexist with lice populations. The results originated by this study will serve as foundation to investigate putative role of sea lice as vectors for fish pathogens and also as reservoirs for antibiotic-resistant genes.

AB  - Technological advancements that enable countries to produce farmed seafood domestically, including land-based production, could potentially improve sustainability measures. However, whether consumers prefer domestic farmed seafood to imported seafood is unclear. This paper aims to fill this gap by employing hypothetical choice experiments from the US, France, and Japan. We find that, in each country, there is a sizable consumer segment (varying from one-quarter to two-thirds of the market) with a strong preference for domestic farmed salmon, including those from land-based production. These consumers associate domestic origin with higher qualities in all relevant dimensions and are willing to pay a price premium. There is also a segment of consumers with a strong preference for imported Norwegian salmon (from one-fifth to two-thirds of the market), linking Norwegian origin to higher qualities, and willing to pay higher prices. Consumers' attitudes towards the environment and food, usage of label information, age, income, and consumption frequencies, are among the characteristics that explain consumer heterogeneity. Our results show the market potential for domestic farmed seafood, thus, providing consumers with reliable origin information for farmed seafood that also covers land-based production would be important. At the same time, the existence of a segment with a preference for imported seafood implies that active trade will remain, indicating the importance of continued international corporation for a holistic and transparent policy framework and common standards for a sustainable aquatic food system.

AB  - Humans have a penchant for unintentionally selecting against that which they desire most. In fishes, unprecedented reductions in abundance have been associated with unprecedented changes in harvesting and aquaculture technologies. Fishing, the predominant cause of fish-population collapses, is increasingly believed to generate evolutionary changes to characters of import to individual fitness, population persistence and levels of sustainable yield. Human-induced genetic change to wild populations can also result from interactions with their domesticated counterparts. Our examination of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution includes factors that may influence the magnitude, rate and reversibility of genetic responses, the potential for shifts in reaction norms and reduced plasticity, loss of genetic variability, outbreeding depression and their demographic consequences to wild fishes. We also suggest management initiatives to mitigate the effects of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution. Ultimately, the question of whether fishing or fish farming can cause evolutionary change is moot. The key issue is whether such change is likely to have negative conservation- or socio-economic consequences. Although the study of human-induced evolution on fishes should continue to include estimates of the magnitude and rate of selection, there is a critical need for research that addresses short- and long-term demographic consequences to population persistence, plasticity, recovery and productivity.

AB  - Carnivorous marine finfish aquaculture has been the subject of intense criticism. Because the process consumes more fish biomass in the form of fishmeal and fish oil than it produces, critics argue carnivorous marine finfish aquaculture causes a net loss of living marine resources and is unsustainable given the continued expansion of the industry. While this “fish-in fish-out” critique is factually correct, it fails to capture all the costs and benefits of carnivorous marine finfish aquaculture. Accepted theories on energy and matter flow between trophic levels indicate that carnivorous marine finfish aquaculture appropriates less ocean primary production than commercial fishing and, as we show, it is generally less demanding of agricultural resources and inputs than terrestrial animal husbandry. The basic fish-in fish-out critique also neglects to consider the fishmeal industry with sufficient granularity. The amount of small pelagic fish harvested for reduction has remained stable despite increased carn...

Fish growth (weight gain 1.75 g fish day−1), net production (NP, 10.16 kg m−3) and survival (94.24%) were within acceptable limits. Ulva showed significantly higher (F = 62.62, d.f. 3, 35; P < 0.0001) specific growth rates at lower density compared with higher density and under high flow versus low flow (SGR = 5.78% vs. 2.55% at lower flow and 10.60% vs. 6.26% at higher flow). Biomass yield of Ulva at low- and high-stocking densities (111.11 and 83.2 g wet wt m−2 day−1, respectively) at low flow and (267.44 and 244.19 g wet wt m−2 day−1, respectively) at high flow show that high flow rate and lower density favoured growth. Removal rates of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) (0.26–0.31 g m−2 day−1) and phosphate phosphorus (0.32–0.41 g m−2 day−1) by U. lactuca were not significantly different (F = 1.9, d.f. 3, 59; P = 0.1394 for TAN and F = 0.29, d.f. 3, 59; P = 0.8324 for phosphates) at both the flow rates and stocking densities. Results show that the effluent flow rate has significant impact over the performance of the seaweed than stocking density.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas (GHG) which has a global warming potential 310 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a hundred year lifespan. N2O is generated during microbial nitrification and denitrification, which are common in aquaculture systems. To date, few studies have been conducted to quantify N2O emission from aquaculture. Additionally, very little is known with respect to the microbial pathways through which N2O is formed in aquaculture systems. This review suggests that aquaculture can be an important anthropogenic source of N2O emission. The global N2O–N emission from aquaculture in 2009 is estimated to be 9.30 × 1010 g, and will increase to 3.83 × 1011g which could account for 5.72% of anthropogenic N2O–N emission by 2030 if the aquaculture industry continues to increase at the present annual growth rate (about 7.10%). The possible mechanisms and various factors affecting N2O production are summarized, and two possible methods to minimize N2O emission, namely aquaponic ...

AB  - This study presents results from a life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted following the CML-IA method on caged aquaculture of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) species at Como River, Kenyir Lake, Terengganu, Malaysia. In this study, the greenhouse gas (GHG) estimation, calculated based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines, showed that 245.27 C eq (1.69 Kg) of nitrate oxide (N2O) was emitted from the lake. The determination of LCA was conducted using several inputs, namely N2O, compositions of fish feed, materials used to build fish cages (infrastructure), main materials used during operation and several databases, namely Agri-footprint, Ecoinvent 3, European Reference Life-Cycle Database (ELCD), and Industry Data 2.0. The results show that feed formulation is the major contributor to potential environmental impact in aquaculture farming, at 55%, followed by infrastructure at 33% and operation at 12%. The feed formulation consisting of 53% broken rice contributed to marine ecotoxicity (MET), while those consisting of 44% fish meal and 33% soybean meal contributed to abiotic depletion (ABD) and global warming (GW), respectively. It is recommended that the percentage of ingredients used in feed formulation in fish farming are further studied to reduce its impacts to the environment.

AB  - Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, are naturally occurring parasites of salmon in sea water. Intensive salmon farming provides better conditions for parasite growth and transmission compared with natural conditions, creating problems for both the salmon farming industry and, under certain conditions, wild salmonids. Salmon lice originating from farms negatively impact wild stocks of salmonids, although the extent of the impact is a matter of debate. Estimates from Ireland and Norway indicate an odds ratio of 1.1:1-1.2:1 for sea lice treated Atlantic salmon smolt to survive sea migration compared to untreated smolts. This is considered to have a moderate population regulatory effect. The development of resistance against drugs most commonly used to treat salmon lice is a serious concern for both wild and farmed fish. Several large initiatives have been taken to encourage the development of new strategies, such as vaccines and novel drugs, for the treatment or removal of salmon lice from farmed fish. The newly sequenced salmon louse genome will be an important tool in this work. The use of cleaner fish has emerged as a robust method for controlling salmon lice, and aquaculture production of wrasse is important towards this aim. Salmon lice have large economic consequences for the salmon industry, both as direct costs for the prevention and treatment, but also indirectly through negative public opinion.

AB  - Farmed Atlantic cod Gadus morhua have been hypothesized to pose a risk to the natural environment through escape of fish or release of their gametes from sea cages. The use of sterile triploids has been suggested as a way to prevent spawning of farmed fish, whether escaped from their cages or still contained within them. This laboratory study examined the reproductive potential of triploid male Atlantic cod, both in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrated that triploid males in com- petitive, size-matched mating with diploid males were successful at siring young. Spermatozoa pro- duced by triploid males were larger than those of diploids, but did not differ in swimming velocity or ability to fertilize eggs. Hatch and larval survival rates, however, were reduced for progeny of triploid males. These diagnostic characteristics of aneuploidy suggest that although farmed triploid male cod may compete successfully with wild diploids for spawning access to wild females, their offspring will not survive.

AB  - The production of food for a growing world population is a great challenge. In particular, protein and the long-chain n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which exert a series of potential health effects, are scarce resources in the context of global food security. Fish from wild capture and aquaculture production cannot meet the current demand for EPA and DHA; therefore, a supplementation with alternative sources is crucial. Specific microalgae species have been shown to be a lucrative source of EPA, DHA, and protein, in particular, the oleaginous microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This study aimed to compare different cultivation scenarios of Nannochloropsis sp. and P. tricornutum with the production of aquaculture and capture fish as traditional sources of EPA and DHA in terms of environmental impacts. Scenarios included borosilicate glass and acrylic glass as photobioreactor (PBR) materials, two different tube diameters, and three different cultivation seasons. In these scenarios, carbon dioxide was modeled as an avoided burden. Additionally, all scenarios were modeled with the burdens resulting from carbon dioxide production. Environmental impacts of selected fish species were obtained from systematic literature research. Life cycle assessment following ISO 14040/44 was used to analyze the global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, cumulative energy demand, water footprint, and land use. The system boundaries were set from “cradle-to-store,” where the target store is located in Germany. Microalgae biomass as a source of EPA, DHA, and protein was found to have similar or lower environmental impacts than fish fillet from wild capture and aquaculture production when carbon dioxide was modeled as an avoided burden. Microalgae production that included the full burden of carbon dioxide production still caused similar or lower environmental impacts than aquaculture fish. It was found that the distinct microalgae species can significantly influence the results if the comparison is conducted based on nutritional values. Regarding the recommended daily intake of 250–500 mg EPA+DHA, microalgae are an advisable source of nutrients to lessen the environmental pressure on marine ecosystems.

AB  - The Swedish coastal zone suffers from environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, overexploitation of fish stock and habitat destruction. Moreover, the coastal zone is an area of conflicts between many users, representing different types of fishery, aquaculture, tourism and nature conservation, among others. On the other hand, Sweden has taken measures to regulate coastal problems. Recently, efforts have been devoted to “Sustainable Coastal Zone Management” (SUCOZOMA). They are directed towards promoting a management of marine and coastal ecosystems that approaches the requirements of sustainability. The SUCOZOMA research program was launched in 1997 and is funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA) for the period 1997–2000.

AB  - The rapid growth of aquaculture production has required a huge power demand, which is estimated to be about 40% of the total energy cost. However, it is possible to reduce this expense using alternatives such as renewable energy (i.e., solar energy) instead of non-renewable energy. Solar energy is one of the cleanest energy sources and is touted as a potential renewable energy source for the world with benefits such as reducing CO2 emissions, reversing global warming by being eco-friendly, and bringing innovation to sustainable aquaculture and potential cost-efficiency for manufacturing. In this review, we present an overview of using non-renewable and renewable energy sources for aquaculture by reviewing several articles and applications of solar energy at many companies in the world. Moreover, this review shows potential and future trends using solar energy for aquaculture.

AB  - <jats:p>Understanding the factors driving the spatial distribution of infectious agents in populations is key to predicting infectious agent distributions under future ecological and anthropogenic scenarios. We applied a geostatistical analysis to a data set of 59 infectious agents assayed in thousands of Chinook and coho salmon in their first marine year to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with the probability and density (infectious agent load) of infection. Meta-analysis of the pathogen-specific geostatistical models indicated that sea surface salinity was the extrinsic factor most frequently associated with infection probability and density for a majority of infectious agents. In addition, agents that were categorized as having a moderate risk of transmission from aquaculture to wild salmon were more likely to occur, and at higher infection densities, in fish collected closer to active aquaculture facilities. Although hypotheses pertaining to other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including age at ocean entry, known hatchery origin, and sea surface temperature deviation, were not supported by the meta-analysis results, some individual agents demonstrated strong associations with these factors. Our results suggest that climate-change-driven shifts in coastal seawater salinity (and to a lesser extent, temperature) may result in changes to the infection dynamics of several infectious agents. In addition, our results contribute to existing evidence characterizing the risk of infectious agent transmission from netpen aquaculture to free-ranging salmon.</jats:p>

AB  - Antibiotic resistance continues to be an emerging threat both in clinical and environmental settings. Among the many causes, the impact of postchlorinated human wastewater on antibiotic resistance has not been well studied. Our study compared antibiotic susceptibility among Aeromonas spp. in postchlorinated effluents to that of the recipient riverine populations for three consecutive years against 12 antibiotics. Aeromonas veronii and Aeromonas hydrophila predominated among both aquatic environments, although greater species diversity was evident in treated wastewater. Overall, treated wastewater contained a higher prevalence of nalidixic acid-, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT)-, and tetracycline-resistant isolates, as well as multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates compared to upstream surface water. After selecting for tetracycline-resistant strains, 34.8% of wastewater isolates compared to 8.3% of surface water isolates were multidrug resistant, with nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and SXT being the most common. Among tetracycline-resistant isolates, efflux pump genes tetE and tetA were the most prevalent, though stronger resistance correlated with tetA. Over 50% of river and treated wastewater isolates exhibited cytotoxicity that was significantly correlated with serine protease activity, suggesting many MDR strains from effluent have the potential to be pathogenic. These findings highlight that conventionally treated wastewater remains a reservoir of resistant, potentially pathogenic bacterial populations being introduced into aquatic systems that could pose a threat to both the environment and public health.IMPORTANCE Aeromonads are Gram-negative, asporogenous rod-shaped bacteria that are autochthonous in fresh and brackish waters. Their pathogenic nature in poikilotherms and mammals, including humans, pose serious environmental and public health concerns especially with rising levels of antibiotic resistance. Wastewater treatment facilities serve as major reservoirs for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and resistant bacterial populations and are, thus, a potential major contributor to resistant populations in aquatic ecosystems. However, few longitudinal studies exist analyzing resistance among human wastewater effluents and their recipient aquatic environments. In this study, considering their ubiquitous nature in aquatic environments, we used Aeromonas spp. as bacterial indicators of environmental antimicrobial resistance, comparing it to that in postchlorinated wastewater effluents over 3 years. Furthermore, we assessed the potential of these resistant populations to be pathogenic, thus elaborating on their potential public health threat.

AB  - Fish disease surveillance methods can be complicated and time consuming, which limits their value for timely intervention strategies on aquaculture farms. Novel molecular-based assays using droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) can produce immediate results and enable high sample throughput with the ability to multiplex several targets using different fluorescent dyes. A ddPCR tetraplex assay was developed for priority salmon diseases for farmers in New Zealand including New Zealand <i>Rickettsia</i>-like organism 1 (NZ-RLO1), NZ-RLO2, <i>Tenacibaculum maritimum</i>, and <i>Yersinia ruckeri</i>. The limit of detection in singleplex and tetraplex assays was reached for most targets at 10<sup>-9</sup> ng/μl with, respectively, NZ-RLO1 = 0.931 and 0.14 copies/μl, NZ-RLO2 = 0.162 and 0.21 copies/μl, <i>T. maritimum =</i> 0.345 and 0.93 copies/μl, while the limit of detection for <i>Y. ruckeri</i> was 10<sup>-8</sup> with 1.0 copies/μl and 0.7 copies/μl. While specificity of primers was demonstrated in previous studies, we detected cross-reactivity of <i>T. maritimum</i> with some strains of <i>Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi</i> and <i>Y. ruckeri</i> with <i>Serratia liquefaciens</i>, respectively. The tetraplex assay was applied as part of a commercial fish disease surveillance program in New Zealand for 1 year to demonstrate the applicability of tetraplex tools for the salmonid aquaculture industry.

AB  - In 1995, the British Columbia Government imposed a moratorium on salmon farming expansion and conducted an environmental assessment review of the industry. Despite the generally favourable conclusions of this review, the government delayed making a decision on the future of the industry for more than 2 years. This issue is examined using a graph model for conflict resolution. The graph model requires only ordinal preferences for the decision-makers and allows the analyst to impose realistic constraints on the conflict such as providing for unidirectional and common moves. Given the preferences of the players involved in the conflict, inaction on the part of the provincial government was a stable solution for 2 years. The deteriorating economic situation in British Columbia combined with an improved public acceptance of the salmon farming industry shifted the solution to one of adopting the recommendations from the environmental assessment review and eventually lifting the moratorium.

AB  - Abstract Infestations by the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and amoebic gill disease (AGD) are currently significant disease concerns facing the Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry in Ireland. Increasing seawater temperatures, and the move away from chemotherapeutants has prompted a new approach to researching areas of host-parasite life histories and using the physiology and behaviour of the parasites to develop novel control methods. Freshwater, with a low ionic concentration can be used to control sea lice and AGD but this may not always be available. Alternative treatments with hydrogen peroxide can prove toxic at the higher summer water temperatures experienced at this latitude. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of using nano-filtered hyposaline water as a non-medicinal method to reduce sea lice (L. salmonis and Caligus elongatus) infestation levels and amoebic gill disease under commercial conditions on an Atlantic salmon farm. To achieve this salmon were bathed in a tarpaulin filled with 5 ppt hyposaline water for 4.5 h and a regime of prophylactic bath treatments put in place to follow the production cycle. The nano-filtration unit consistently produced low saline water and resulted in a significant reduction of sea lice levels and AGD following routine 4.5 h baths. A 4.5 h bioassay of detached salmon lice confirmed both hyposaline and freshwater were equally effective against L. salmonis in the absence of the host.

AB  - Until very recently most research relating environmental quality and aquaculture
was limited to assessment of environmental conditions necessary for culture. Emphasis was
placed on dissolved oxygen requirement of the culture fish or the maximum dissolved
nitrogen level that could be tolerated without impairment of growth rates or survival. Most
attention was directed towards the effect of the environment upon the aquaculture operation,
while the converse perspective, the effect of aquaculture upon environmental quality, was
largely ignored. The sustainability of aquaculture development and the environmental impacts
of aquaculture operations have become a matter of considerable concern for all stakeholders.
The development of the aquaculture industry, especially if it is to sustain its current growth,
depends on finding ways to increase its environmental, economic and social acceptability.
The technique used to culture salmonids throughout the world varies greatly with respect to
the water source and means of confining the fish. With the rapid growth of salmonid cage
culture over the past decade has come increased examination of this industry segment as a
potential pollution source. Aquaculture pollution mainly originates from the physical and
chemical characteristics of feed and the applied feeding management. This article reviews the
available information on those environmental impacts of salmonid culture and three
reportedly environmentally-friendly alternatives; a marine floating bag system; a land-based
saltwater flow-through system; and a land-based freshwater recirculating system.

AB  - By moving away from coastal waters and hence reducing pressure on nearshore ecosystems, offshore aquaculture can be seen as a possible step towards the large-scale expansion of the marine food production. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) in nearshore water bodies has received increasing attention and could therefore play a role in the transfer of aquaculture operations to offshore areas. IMTA holds scope for multi-use of offshore areas and can bring environmental benefits from making use of waste products and transforming these into valuable co-products. Furthermore, they may act as alternative marine production systems and provide scope for alternative income options for coastal communities, e.g. by acting as nodes for farm operation and maintenance requirements. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge on the implications of the exposed nature of the offshore and open ocean sites on the biological, technological and socio-economic performance of IMTA. Of particular interest is improving knowledge about resource flows between integrated species in hydrodynamic challenging conditions that characterise offshore waters.

AB  - Physiological indicators of social and nutritional stress can provide insight into the responses of species to changes in food availability. In coastal British Columbia, Canada, grizzly bears evolved with spawning salmon as an abundant but spatially and temporally constrained food source. Recent and dramatic declines in salmon might have negative consequences on bear health and ultimately fitness. To examine broadly the chronic endocrine effects of a salmon niche, we compared cortisol, progesterone, and testosterone levels in hair from salmon-eating bears from coastal BC (n = 75) with the levels in a reference population from interior BC lacking access to salmon (n = 42). As predicted, testosterone was higher in coastal bears of both sexes relative to interior bears, possibly reflecting higher social density on the coast mediated by salmon availability. We also investigated associations between the amount of salmon individual bears consumed (as measured by stable isotope analysis) and cortisol and testosterone in hair. Also as predicted, cortisol decreased with increasing dietary salmon and was higher after a year of low dietary salmon than after a year of high dietary salmon. These findings at two spatial scales suggest that coastal bears might experience nutritional or social stress in response to on-going salmon declines, providing novel insights into the effects of resource availability on fitness-related physiology.

AB  - 따개비, 담치류 및 해조류와 같은 생물은 해양구조물 및 양식시설에 부착하여 시설물의 기능을 저하, 내구성 감소, 주변 환경 및 생태계의 변화 등 다양한 문제를 야기시킨다(Callow and Edyvean, 1990). 특히 부착현상에 의한 양식시설의 경제적인 손실은 전 세계적으로 보고되어 있다(Enright 1993).일례로 이러한 생물이 양식시설의 그물에 생물이 부착하게 되면 그물이 손상되거나 망목 크기를 줄여(Beveridge, 2004) 조류 소통을 방해하게 된다(Eckman et al., 2001). 이로 인해 노폐물 배출과 영양염 공급이 원활하지 못하게 되며(Ahlgren, 1998; Eckman et al., 2001), 결국 부영양화 현상을 발생시킨다(Folke et al., 1994). 또한 선박의 밑면에 부착생물들이 붙게 되면 선체 표면이 거칠어져 자주 보수를 해줘야 하며, 속도저하로 인한 연료소비 증가 등의 문제점이 발생한다(Voulvoulis et al. 1999). 선박과 그물 그리고 해양 구조물의 부착을 방지하기 위해 기존에 사용해 온 TBTO (tributyltin oxide)는 강한 독성을 지닌 화합물로서 어패류 등에 농축되며 농도에 따라 수정억제, 발생억제, 운동성저하 등의 문제를 일으키고 오염이 매우 심화되면 굴의 패각이 기형화되고 성장도 더디게 된다(Voulvoulis et al., 1999). 따라서 TBTO의 대체물질로 최근에는 Irgarol, dichlofluanid, diuron (Voulvoulis et al., 2000) 등을 사용하고 있지만 넓은 지역의 해수와 해양저질에서 이들 물질들이 검출이 보고되고 있고(Voulvoulis, 2006; Dafforn et al., 2011) Irgarol과 diuron은 조류의 광합성을 억제하고 dichlofluanid는 발암성 물질로 어패류의 돌연변이를 유도하는 것으로 보고되었다(Fern´andez-Alba et al. 2002). 따라서 해양 생태계에 해로운 영향을 미치지 않는 새로운 방오물질의 개발을 목표로 본 연구는 해조류의 성장을 저해하는 부착성 사상세균

AB  - Aquaculture management authorities require the ability to identify the farm of origin for escaped fish. Physical tagging is routinely conducted for domesticated animals (e.g. sheep and cat- tle); however, there are considerable logistical, animal welfare and economic issues that challenge the feasibility of physically tagging all farmed fish. A 'DNA stand-by method' for identification of escaped Atlantic salmon, back to the cage and farm of origin, was established at the Institute of Marine Research in Norway. In addition, proof-of-concept for the method has been demonstrated to be able to trace rainbow trout and Atlantic cod escapees back to their farm source. The combined sampling, genotyping and statistical analysis on which the method is based has been implemented successfully in the identification of fish farm escapees in Norway, resulting in fines for companies found in breach of regulations. This paper reviews the method, its challenges, and some previously considered alternatives. It is concluded that as the method has been successful for the 3 major spe- cies farmed in Norway, each with contrasting production logistics including breeding programs, state of domestication, and magnitude of production, the DNA stand-by method can be applicable to iden- tification of fish farm escapees for a wide range of aquaculture species in all regions of the world.

AB  - In France, rainbow trout farming in flow-through systems raises environmental concerns. To address this, there is a growing interest in organic aquaculture. In this study, we employed an attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) to analyze the environmental impacts of rainbow trout production, comparing conventional and organic practices in a model fish farm. Our life cycle impact assessment revealed that organic farming significantly reduced environmental impacts per tonne of trout in seven of the nine selected impact categories. Notably, freshwater ecotoxicity exhibited the most significant difference, with organic systems showing a 35% decrease. The only exceptions were freshwater eutrophication and water dependence, where organic production led to higher impacts per tonne of trout. In conventional farming, emissions amounted to 14 kg of P eq./tonne, whereas in organic farming, the emissions were slightly higher (15 kg of P eq./tonne). For water dependence, one tonne of trout production in the conventional system mobilized 128 103 m3 vs. 185 103 m3 in the organic system. The environmental benefits of organic production were even more marked when using a surface-based functional unit (m2y). We demonstrated the benefits of organic trout production from an environmental perspective. However, our findings highlight the caution needed when interpreting LCA comparisons of such production systems that can be highly influenced by methodological choices such as the functional unit used.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest dangers to public health of the 21st century, threatening the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases globally. Disinfection, the elimination of microbial species via the application of biocidal chemicals, is essential to control infectious diseases and safeguard animal and human health. In an era of antimicrobial resistance and emerging disease, the effective application of biocidal control measures is vital to protect public health. The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the increasing demand for effective biocidal solutions to reduce and eliminate disease transmission. However, there is increasing recognition into the relationship between biocide use and the proliferation of Antimicrobial Resistance species, particularly multidrug-resistant pathogens. The One Health approach and WHO action plan to combat AMR require active surveillance and monitoring of AMR species; however, biocidal resistance is often overlooked. ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens and numerous fungal species have demonstrated drug and biocidal resistance where increased patient mortality is a risk. Currently, there is a lack of information on the impact of biocide application on environmental habitats and ecosystems. Undoubtedly, the excessive application of disinfectants and AMR will merge to result in secondary disasters relating to soil infertility, loss of biodiversity and destruction of ecosystems.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Antibacterial therapy is still in many cases the only way to control bacterial disease outbreaks, with relevant economic issues. Nevertheless, this necessity should also be well balanced with other relevant aspects such as suitability, efficacy and refinement of the treatments but also with consumer and environmental welfare. With this aim, the literature pertaining to the use of antibacterials (i.e. oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid, flumequine and potentiated sulphonamides) in Mediterranean farmed European seabass (<jats:italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</jats:italic>) and gilthead seabream (<jats:italic>Sparus aurata</jats:italic>) was reviewed and addressed. Knowledge of drug pharmacokinetics along with the related legislation is also presented. The main criteria, technical aspects and constraints affecting the design of an appropriate antibacterial therapy are also discussed. An evaluation of available bibliography revealed the existence of considerable information on several registered antibacterials, while it is limited for others. Typically, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) have been used as a reference for antibacterial selection. However, the methodologies used for MIC assessment require refinement and more sophisticated data such as epidemiological cut‐off breakpoint values. Due to the characteristics of farming systems, antibacterials are mostly delivered through medicated feeds. The large number of production units and number of fish per unit, together with a limited timeframe margin for efficient therapy, makes Mediterranean gilthead seabream and European seabass, one of the best examples where the metaphylactic concept has to be considered in aquatic medicine. The information presented in this review should guide future action taken to fulfil research gaps and promote effective and prudent antibacterial practices.</jats:p>

AB  - This paper discusses conceptual confusions of sustainable seafood consumption, practical challenges, and potential anchors from where this behaviour can be fostered. The main focus lies on psychological variables. The resulting framework comprises (1) a definition of sustainable seafood consumption, (2) suggestions for corresponding behaviours, (3) the identification of facilitating and hindering factors, (4) an assemblage of these factors into a theoretical model, and (5) a short discussion of how the model adds up value to the current state of the art in marine resource conservation. Behavioural models significantly contribute to behavioural change research. The originality and value of this research are that it tackles the so far relatively neglected field of sustainable seafood consumption as important part of sustainable development and marine conservation in the future. From an interventional perspective, the developed model facilitates the identification of contact points to approach consumers and disseminate sustainable seafood consumption among modern Western consumers.

AB  - Summary

We used life cycle assessment to evaluate a subset of the cradle-to-destination-port environmental impacts associated with the production, processing, and transportation of frozen, packaged Indonesian tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets to ports in Chicago and Rotterdam. Specifically, we evaluated the cumulative energy use; biotic resource use; and global warming, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions at each life cycle stage and in aggregate. We identify the importance of least environmental cost feed sourcing for reducing supply chain environmental impacts. We also highlight the need for more effective nutrient cycling in intensive aquaculture. The environmental trade-offs inherent in substituting technological inputs for ecosystem services in intensive pond-based versus lake-based production systems are discussed. We further call for more nuanced considerations of comparative environmental advantage in the production and interregional trade of food commodities than has been characteristic of historic food miles discussions. Significant opportunities exist for improving environmental performance in tilapia aquaculture. This product compares favorably, however, with several other fishery, aquaculture, and animal husbandry products, according to the suite of impact categories considered in this study.

AB  - Juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin experience temporally and spatially heterogenous temperature regimes, between cool upper tributaries and the warm channelized Delta, during freshwater rearing and outmigration. Limited water resources necessitate human management of dam releases, allowing temperature modifications. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of temperature on specific dynamic action (SDA), or the metabolic cost associated with feeding and digestion, which is thought to represent a substantial portion of fish energy budgets. Measuring SDA with respect to absolute aerobic scope (AAS), estimated by the difference between maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and standard metabolic rate (SMR), provides a snapshot of its respective energy allocation. Fish were acclimated to 16°C, raised or lowered to each acute temperature (13°C, 16°C, 19°C, 22°C or 24°C), then fed a meal of commercial pellets weighing 2% of their wet mass. We detected a significant positive effect of temperature on SMR and MMR, but not on AAS. As expected, there was no significant effect of temperature on the total O<sub>2</sub> cost of digestion, but unlike other studies, we did not see a significant difference in duration, peak metabolic rate standardized to SMR, time to peak, percent of meal energy utilized, nor the ratio of peak O<sub>2</sub> consumption to SMR. Peak O<sub>2</sub> consumption represented 10.4-14.5% of AAS leaving a large amount of aerobic capacity available for other activities, and meal energy utilized for digestion ranged from 5.7% to 7.2%, leaving substantial remaining energy to potentially assimilate for growth. Our juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon exhibited thermal stability in their SDA response, which may play a role in maintaining homeostasis of digestive capability in a highly heterogeneous thermal environment where rapid growth is important for successful competition with conspecifics and for avoiding predation.

AB  - This research aimed to investigate the present status of disease prevalence and usage of aqua drugs for various aquaculture operations in the Narsingdi region of Bangladesh. Data were collected through the market survey, preset questionnaire interview, personal contact, and participatory rural appraisal tools. Amongst the respondents, the maximum percentages were found practicing mixed cultures of carp, tilapia, and pangas. The respondents suggested that epizootic ulcerative syndrome, saprolegniasis, streptococcosis, tail and fin rot and bacillary necrosis are common fish diseases in the area. About 140 drugs of different companies used in aquaculture for different purposes such as disease treatment, growth enhancement, water quality improvement, toxic gas removal, improvement of feed conversion ratio. Zeolite, rotenone, disinfectant, oxygen precursors, ammonia reducers, and probiotics were applied for pond preparation, water, and soil quality maintenance, while 30 different antibiotics were used for the purpose of treatment. Among the available antibiotics, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, sulphadiazine, and trimethoprim were found extensively used by the fish farmers. Four enzymes and eighteen growth promoters were identified as being utilized to enhance digestion and boost up the production. This study elicited various issues connected with application and administration of such aqua chemicals, including farmers' ignorance about their usage, proper doses, application methods, withdrawal period, and the human health concerns associated with their irresponsible use. However, the consequences of these chemical products to the environment, animal health, and human health required further study for the betterment of mankind.

AB  - This paper aims to clarify and present discussions about the COVID-19 disease, its variants and prevention measures, as well as clarifying the excessive use of antimicrobials in the protocols of patients infected with it, as this practice can intensify an already existing public health problem, which is antimicrobial resistance. The methodology used in this research was a literature review on bacterial resistance due to the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials and the possible impacts caused in the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the variants of worldwide concern, based on the Scientific Electronic Library Online databases - SCIELO, National Library of Medicine - PubMed, CAPES Journal Portal, Academic Google and National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). Based on the literature presented here, it is concluded that COVID-19 is a disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) presenting a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe conditions. Several variants have emerged in several countries modifying the dynamics of transmissibility and potential immune flight from the disease, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) being a greater threat to public health due to its high transmissibility. The misuse and excessive use of antimicrobials prescribed for the treatment of this disease can favor the emergence of superbugs and such resistance is a global problem. Therefore, the help of laboratory and clinical tests is essential to carry out a therapeutic intervention, observing the best options for each clinical case, since COVID-19 is a new disease and still under study.

AB  - Seafood is a growing part of the economy, but its economic value is dimin- ished by marine diseases. Infectious diseases are common in the ocean, and here we tabulate 67 examples that can reduce commercial species' growth and survivorship or decrease seafood quality. These impacts seem most problem- atic in the stressful and crowded conditions of aquaculture, which increas- ingly dominates seafood production as wild fishery production plateaus. For instance, marine diseases of farmed oysters, shrimp, abalone, and various fishes, particularly Atlantic salmon, cost billions of dollars each year. In comparison, it is often difficult to accurately estimate disease impacts on wild populations, especially those of pelagic and subtidal species. Farmed species often receive infectious diseases from wild species and can, in turn, export infectious agents to wild species. However, the impact of disease ex- port on wild fisheries is controversial because there are few quantitative data demonstrating that wild species near farms suffer more from infectious dis- eases than those in other areas. The movement of exotic infectious agents to new areas continues to be the greatest concern.

AB  - With the high output and large use of antibiotics in the process of aquaculture, pollution caused by antibiotics in water environments is becoming a thorny problem, and its ecological risk has aroused widespread concern. In this work, the lanthanide hybrid material Eu@ZIF-90–PA is synthesized by a two-step post synthesis strategy using ZIF-90 with a modifiable group as a parent skeleton. Owing to its luminescence properties and water stability, the lanthanide functionalized material can be utilized as a novel “turn-on” fluorescent probe for quantitative detection of flumequine in water environments. Additionally, the probe can not only be reused, but also quickly respond to flumequine within 30 s and the detection limit is 0.24 ppm. Even in the complex river water, the probe still exhibits an obvious luminescence enhancement effect with flumequine, which provides an efficient and convenient method for the detection of flumequine in real water. Finally, the fluorescence enhancement mechanism between flumequine and the probe is further explored.

AB  - Abstract Participatory management is widely recognised as a working method of paramount importance, based on the principles of knowledge sharing, accountability and legitimacy. Hence, it is broadly considered suitable for addressing issues related to the sustainable development of the seafood industry, and specifically, of the aquaculture system. A survey focused on the current EU regulatory framework was carried out to elicit stakeholders’ preferences, knowledge and experience on key issues for the development of organic aquaculture, supported by science-based regulations. The survey was completed by 65 stakeholders belonging to several categories, and it was supported by the implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. Stakeholders’ preferences were elicited on organic production methods and control systems, the quality of the environment and organic products, fish health and welfare. The views expressed by the participants revealed both competence and awareness, despite the complexity of the subject. Several ideas and useful suggestions emerged regarding unresolved technical issues. In addition, the need for a targeted communication strategy on the quality of organic aquaculture products and the necessity of fostering European/national programs to support the production and marketing of organic aquaculture products were highlighted.

AB  - Significant challenges to worldwide sustainable food production continue to arise from environmental change and consistent population growth. In order to meet increasing demand, fish production industries are encouraged to maintain high growth densities and to rely on antibiotic intervention throughout all stages of development. The inappropriate administering of antibiotics over time introduces selective pressure, allowing the survival of resistant bacterial strains through adaptive pathways involving transferable nucleotide sequences (i.e., plasmids). This is one of the essential mechanisms of antibiotic resistance development in food production systems. This review article focuses on the main international regulations and governing the administering of antibiotics in finfish husbandry and summarizes recent data regarding the distribution of bacterial resistance in the finfish aquaculture food production chain. The second part of this review examines promising alternative approaches to finfish production, sustainable farming techniques, and vaccination that circumvents excessive antibiotic use, including new animal welfare measures. Then, we reflect on recent adaptations to increasingly interdisciplinary perspectives in the field and their greater alignment with the One Health initiative.

AB  - Abstract In theory, competitive emission permit markets minimize total abatement costs. Permit markets are often imperfectly competitive, however, and may be thin and dominated by large firms. The dominant firm(s) could exercise market power and increase other firms’ costs of pollution control, while reducing their own emission control costs. This paper reports a testbed laboratory experiment to examine whether a dominant firm can exercise market power in a permit market organized using the double auction trading institution. Our parameters approximate the abatement costs of sources in a proposed tradable emissions market for the reduction of nitrogen in the Port Phillip Watershed in Victoria, Australia. We vary across treatments the initial allocation of permits to sources, so that in one treatment the seller of permits is a monopolist and in another treatment the market is duopolistic. We also vary the information that subjects have about the number and abatement costs of their competitors. We find that prices and seller profits are higher and efficiency is lower on average in the monopoly sessions compared with the duopoly sessions, but the differences are not substantial and are not statistically significant due to pronounced variation across sessions. Moreover, prices, profits and transaction volumes are usually much closer to the competitive equilibrium (CE) than the monopoly equilibrium.

AB  - In recent years, a growing interest from consumers to know the origins and contents of foods has put alternative choices, such as organic foods and dietary changes, on the agenda. Dietary choices are important to address, as many studies find that activities related to food production account for nearly 20–30% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nonetheless, while GHG emissions are important, often other environmental impact categories are not considered in the assessment of the sustainability of different foods, diets and choices. This study aims to quantify the implications of dietary choices for Swedish food consumption on a broad range of environmental impact categories using life cycle assessment to provide insight into the impacts, and potential tradeoffs, associated with certain food products and dietary choices. Scenarios are used to assess the implications of diets with reduced meat, increased Swedish food consumption, increased organic foods, vegan and semi-vegetarian diets. The results indicate that tradeoffs could be possible with certain dietary choices. Increasing Swedish food production and consumption may lead to lower impacts for all impact categories by reducing imports, although limitations in growing season and availability of foods in Sweden allows only for minor increases. The results also indicate that large reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are possible by reducing meat consumption, i.e., by halving meat consumption and through vegan and vegetarian diets. Nonetheless, an increase in vegetable, legume and fruit products may lead to a potential increase in human and ecosystem toxicity. Diets based on nutritional guidelines, show reductions in all impact categories, as these guidelines call for an increase in vegetables and fruits and a reduction in meat consumption. An increase in organic foods showed no significant change in climate impact, although toxicity potential was reduced significantly. Increasing consumption of organic foods may also lead to a reduction in biodiversity damage potential, and if all food is produced organically, it risks increasing eutrophication and land use.

AB  - Metabolomics applications to the aquaculture research are increasing steadily. The use of standardized proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy can provide the aquaculture industry with an unbiased, reproducible, and high-throughput screening tool, which can help to diagnose nutritional and disease-related metabolic disorders in farmed fish. Standard operating procedures developed for analysing (human) plasma by 1H NMR were applied to fingerprint the metabolome in plasma samples collected from Atlantic salmon. The aim was to explore the metabolome of salmon plasma in relation to growth stage and sampling site. A total of 72 salmon were collected from three aquaculture sites in Norway (Lat. 65, 67, and 70 °N) and over two sampling events (December 2017 and November 2018). Plasma drawn from each salmon was measured by 1H NMR and metabolites were quantified using the SigMa software. The NMR data was analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA). Important metabolic differences were evidenced, with adult salmon having a much higher content of very low-density lipoproteins and cholesterol in their plasma, while smolts displayed significantly higher levels of propylene glycol. Overall, 24% of the metabolite variation was due to the growth stage, whereas 12% of the metabolite variation was related to the aquaculture site and practice (p < 0.001). This study provides a baseline investigation of the plasma metabolome of the Atlantic salmon and demonstrates how 1H NMR metabolomics can be used in future investigations for comparing aquaculture practices and their influence on the fish metabolome.

AB  - Due to the socioeconomic importance of salmon farming in the North Atlantic and the economic impact of sea lice in this industry, there is high demand for novel pest control methods. One such method is the use of cleaner fish to remove the lice from the salmon. A cleaner fish that has recently gained in popularity due to its ability to work in cold water, is the lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus). This fish varies in efficiency, but when mortality is low and cleaning optimal, the fish are successful in keeping parasite burdens low. However, there is some concern for the welfare of lumpfish in the industry, because mortality is often high. This is sometimes attributed to inadequate feeding and shelter. Here we compare growth, body condition, and fin health of fish reared for four weeks in a crossed treatment design crossing shelter availability (shelter vs none) and feed delivery method (manual meal time feeds and continuous automated feeding). In terms of weight gain, shelter availability interacted with feeding method, with fish that had access to shelters and were fed using automated feeders gaining less weight than other fish. Fin health was not affected, but body condition was lowered both by access to shelter and being fed continuously. The results indicate a need to carefully consider how feeding method and shelter use is combined, both in cages and during rearing on land.

AB  - This chapter develops a sustainable economic yield harvesting model for the wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) where the population comprises different age classes. It is shown that the weight–fecundity relationship of the spawning population, comprising two age classes, is crucial for the maximum sustainable yield fishing composition. In a next step, the optimal selective fishing is replaced by an optimal nonselective fishing pattern, and the discrepancy between these two schemes is analyzed.

AB  - There has been significant interest in the development of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) in Europe. Much of this interest has come from academia and regulators, and while elements within the European aquaculture industry have expressed an interest, to date, the adoption of the concept has been limited. Part of the attraction for regulators and academics is the ecological/economic win/win that is associated with eco-innovation solutions. However, if we are to understand why there has been limited uptake of IMTA in Europe, perhaps it is necessary to look at the issue in terms of trade-offs for the individual farmer or company. Using this viewpoint, we investigate the balance of trade-offs for the individual farmer or company to diversify from a traditional fin-fish production business into an IMTA system. In doing so, we reveal that the bal- ance of trade-offs is currently not sufficiently positive to motivate the large-scale uptake of IMTA in Europe, and we contrast this against the situation in Asia where the balance of trade-offs gives better support for the adoption and practice of IMTA. By better understanding the trade-offs for the individual, it is possible to better understand the conditions that will promote the development of IMTA in Europe.

AB  - The salmon louse is a highly abundant ectoparasitic copepod of salmonids in the North Pacific and Atlantic. Widespread and rapid development of resistance to chemical agents used to delouse salmonids on marine farms is now threatening the continued development of the aquaculture industry, and has served as a potent catalyst for the development of alternative pest management strategies. These include fresh and warm-water treatments to which the louse is sensitive. However, given the well-documented evolutionary capacity of this species, the risk of developing tolerance towards these environmental treatments cannot be dismissed. Two common-garden experiments were performed using full-sibling families of lice identified by DNA parentage testing to investigate whether one of the fundamental premises for evolution, in this context genetic variation in the capacity of coping with fresh or warm-water, exists within this species. Significant differences in survival were observed among families in both experiments, although for the salinity experiment, it was not possible to unequivocally disentangle background mortality from treatment-induced mortality. Thus, our data demonstrate genetic variation in tolerance of warm-water, and are suggestive of genetic variation in salinity tolerance. We conclude that extensive use of these environmental-based treatments to delouse salmonids on commercial farms may drive lice towards increased tolerance.

AB  - Abstract Background In the last decades, food produced by aquaculture has seen an impressive increase worldwide but maintaining high quality and safety is increasingly becoming a concern. It is apparent that changes in- and outside the aquaculture supply chain may act as driving forces for the introduction of food safety hazards. Knowledge on these drivers of change and their impact in the various steps in the food supply chain may help food producers to mitigate to potential risks and maintain high-quality food. Scope and approach In this study, we analysed the use of expert driven methodologies to assess and predict the effect of drivers of change on selected food/feed safety vulnerabilities in the salmon aquaculture supply chain of Norway. The presented overview is based on the findings of the “Aquarius” project, which was funded by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Key findings and conclusions In this study, over 100 experts were involved and various expert elicitation methods were applied such as on-line questionnaires, interviews, Delphi and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA). This approach resulted in a comprehensive overview of the Norwegian salmon supply chain. For each step in the supply chain, vulnerabilities for human and animal health were identified, which were prioritised by FMEA. For the two highest-ranked vulnerabilities in each step of the supply chain, drivers were identified and prioritised by expert elicitation in a Delphi study. Also, indicators and linked data sources were obtained for the highest-ranked drivers. The comprehensive information collected was integrated in a Bayesian Network (BN) model that links data sources for indicators and drivers of change. The applicability of the BN model was demonstrated for salmon health for four vulnerabilities and three steps in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. The accuracy of developed model was 81%.

AB  - Genetic introgression of domesticated to wild conspecifics is of great concern to the genetic integrity and viability of the wild populations. Therefore, we need tools that can be used for monitoring unidirectional gene flow from domesticated to wild populations. A challenge to quantitation of unidirectional gene flow is that both the donor and the recipient population may be genetically substructured and that the subpopulations are subjected to genetic drift and may exchange migrants between one another. We develop a standardized method for quantifying and monitoring domesticated to wild gene flow and demonstrate its usefulness to farm and wild Atlantic salmon as a model species. The challenge of having several wild and farm populations was circumvented by in silico generating one analytical center point for farm and wild salmon, respectively. Distributions for the probability that an individual is wild were generated from individual-based analyses of observed wild and farm genotypes using STRUCTURE. We show that estimates of proportions of the genome being of domesticated origin in a particular wild population can be obtained without having a historical reference sample for the same population. The main advantages of the method presented are the standardized way in which genetic processes within and between populations are taken into account, and the individual-based analyses giving estimates for each individual independent of other individuals. The method makes use of established software, and as long as genetic markers showing generic genetic differences between domesticated and wild populations are available, it can be applied to all species with unidirectional gene flow. Results from our method are easy to interpret and understand, and will serve as a powerful tool for management, especially because there is no need for a specific historical wild reference sample.

AB  - Antibacterial agents are commonly present in aquatic environment at low concentrations. Terrestrial animal farms, human medicine and aquaculture are main sources of water contamination with antibacterials. Antibiotics were proved to be directly toxic to fish causing oxidative stress, general stress response, histopathological lesions, hematological, metabolic, and reproductive disorders, as well as immunosuppressive and genotoxic effects. Environmentally realistic low concentrations of antibiotics also disturb aquatic bacterial communities causing alterations in fish symbiotic microbiota and induce emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria by exerting selective pressure on spread of antibiotic-resistance genes.

AB  - The intention of this study was to identify the bacterial pathogens infecting Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia) and Clarias gariepinus (African catfish), and to establish the antibiotic susceptibility of fish bacteria in Uganda. A total of 288 fish samples from 40 fish farms (ponds, cages, and tanks) and 8 wild water sites were aseptically collected and bacteria isolated from the head kidney, liver, brain and spleen. The isolates were identified by their morphological characteristics, conventional biochemical tests and Analytical Profile Index test kits. Antibiotic susceptibility of selected bacteria was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The following well-known fish pathogens were identified at a farm prevalence of; Aeromonas hydrophila (43.8%), Aeromonas sobria (20.8%), Edwardsiella tarda (8.3%), Flavobacterium spp. (4.2%) and Streptococcus spp. (6.3%). Other bacteria with varying significance as fish pathogens were also identified including Plesiomonas shigelloides (25.0%), Chryseobacterium indoligenes (12.5%), Pseudomonas fluorescens (10.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%), Pseudomonas stutzeri (2.1%), Vibrio cholerae (10.4%), Proteus spp. (6.3%), Citrobacter spp. (4.2%), Klebsiella spp. (4.2%) Serratia marcescens (4.2%), Burkholderia cepacia (2.1%), Comamonas testosteroni (8.3%) and Ralstonia picketti (2.1%). Aeromonas spp., Edwardsiella tarda and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from diseased fish. Aeromonas spp. (n = 82) and Plesiomonas shigelloides (n = 73) were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility. All isolates tested were susceptible to at-least ten (10) of the fourteen antibiotics evaluated. High levels of resistance were however expressed by all isolates to penicillin, oxacillin and ampicillin. This observed resistance is most probably intrinsic to those bacteria, suggesting minimal levels of acquired antibiotic resistance in fish bacteria from the study area. To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish the occurrence of several bacteria species infecting fish; and to determine antibiotic susceptibility of fish bacteria in Uganda. The current study provides baseline information for future reference and fish disease management in the country.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture has grown rapidly and is expected to continue to grow to meet consumer demand. Due to concerns about the environmental impacts associated with salmon aquaculture, eco-labeling groups have developed standards intended to hold salmon producers accountable and provide a more sustainable option to consumers. This study utilized life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental impacts of salmon raised to Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) certification standards in order to determine if ASC certification achieves the intended reductions in impact. We find that environmental impacts, such as global warming potential, do not decrease with certification. We also find that salmon feed, in contrast to the on-site aquaculture practices, dominates the environmental impacts of salmon aquaculture and contributes to over 80% of impacts in ozone depletion, global warming potential, acidification, and ecotoxicity. Based on these findings, we recommend that eco-labeling groups prioritize reducing the environmental impacts of the feed supply chain.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The production of Atlantic salmon in aquaculture has grown substantially over the last 40 years. The unintentional release of domesticated salmon poses a significant risk to the long‐term persistence of wild Atlantic salmon populations through ecological interactions and genetic introgression. Our ability to link aquaculture production to farmed escaped salmon in rivers is still limited and hinders identifying the appropriate production capacity of salmon aquaculture to reduce unwanted interactions between wild and escaped Atlantic salmon.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here we use a 14‐year dataset of farmed escapee abundance in rivers to model how the a priori selected covariables of wild salmon abundance, aquaculture intensity, river discharge, hydropower and fjord placement of the river affects escapee abundance across 54 rivers in western Norway. Then, we evaluate the predictive strength of the model to provide context for its use to minimize escapees.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found that the abundance of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon in rivers is correlated to aquaculture intensity. Furthermore, the abundance of wild Atlantic salmon, mean yearly discharge, and the interaction between fjord placement and wild salmon abundance were important predictors of escapee abundance in rivers.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The model was 40% accurate when predicting the abundance of farmed escaped salmon in rivers. However, the accuracy improved to 75% when using risk categories derived from modelled intrusion rates that induced long‐term genetic changes to the wild population (low &lt; 4%, medium 4%–10%, and high &gt; 10% escaped farmed salmon).</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis and applications</jats:italic>. This study links aquaculture production, at relevant spatiotemporal scales (75 km from rivers), to the abundance of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon in rivers, and provides governmental agencies with a tool to help regulate domesticated salmon production based on the carrying capacity of the system to buffer against introgression between conspecifics. Furthermore, understanding this relationship will be beneficial when establishing new aquaculture sites in pristine ecosystems where they would overlap with wild Atlantic salmon. Finally, future mitigation efforts should continue to focus on new technologies (e.g. triploid females) that can eliminate the risk of introgression without limiting aquaculture production.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

Households with ecoponds have significantly higher fish productivity, fish diversity, and income generation potential compared to households with similar underutilized ponds. Furthermore, certain dimensions of women’s empowerment are improved at the individual and household level (e.g., control of income and productive assets), without, however, addressing wider structural inequalities. Food security impacts are rather inconclusive, as despite the higher consumption of more diverse fish species among ecopond households, there is no significant effect on overall dietary diversity.</jats:p>

AB  - ABSTRACTIntegrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is the farming, in proximity, of aquaculture species from different trophic levels and with complementary ecosystem functions. IMTA allows one species’ uneaten feed and wastes, nutrients, and by-products to be recaptured and converted into fertilizer, feed, and energy for the other crops. By taking advantage of synergistic interactions between species, IMTA can help aquaculture evolve towards more responsible and sustainable systems. This study uses data from a contingent valuation survey to provide an estimation of the non-use benefits that, in the form of biomitigation of the external costs imposed on the marine environment, would be derived by Canadians from the adoption of IMTA for Atlantic salmon aquaculture. We find the benefits accruing to households who do not purchase salmon habitually would range between about $43 million/year and about $65 million/year for the next five years, depending on the treatment of ‘don’t know’ responses to the payment...

AB  - Low-trophic-level fish are a crucial source of long-chain (LC) omega-3 fatty acids for farmed fish and humans. Many farm-raised fish species have a clear need for these nutrients. Farmed fish deposit the LC omega-3s in their flesh and transfer them up the food chain. However, the content of LC omega-3s in farm-raised seafood continues to decline, while the content of shorter-chain plant-sourced omega-3s, and pro-inflammtory omega-6s continue to increase. This reduces its nutritional worth. The value of low-trophic-level fish is often viewed merely as its price at the dock. Some reports and metrics steer public attention towards the mass balance between quantities of low-trophic-level fish and farmed seafood. However, the the nutritional value of seafood is more important than its mere quantities. The role of low-trophic-level fish in human nutrition, health, and wellbeing is a fundamental component of its economic value to society.

AB  - Trout farming is the main fish production system in France. This article describes a system to classify trout farms based on environmental impacts calculated by life cycle assessment and technical and economic indicators. Since the number of surveyed farms was too small for a robust assessment, we combined principal component analysis (PCA) with a non-parametric bootstrap technique. French trout farms were surveyed to collect technical and economic indicators. The representativeness of the survey was verified by comparing it to a national inventory. Life cycle assessment was used to estimate environmental impacts of farms and the contribution of each production stage to impacts. PCA was used to evaluate both technical-economic and environmental indicators of the trout farms, which were separated into three groups based on the size of fish produced (pan-size, large and mixed-size, and very large). Non-parametric bootstrap was used to compare the groups and to test the significance of PCA results. Results validated the fish-farm classification system based on the size of fish produced and indicated that farm operations and fish feeding contributed the most to environmental impacts. The PCA method distinguished three groups via their technical indicators, with non-significant differences among the groups in environmental impacts. However, environmental indicators showed strong links with technical and economic indicators. In conclusion, bootstrapped PCA offers the ability to assess groups of trout production system when the sample size is too small and provides more conservative results by considering uncertainty. Future studies should focus on providing reliable data to reduce uncertainty.

        <jats:p>Future growth of Atlantic salmon (<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic> L.) in Norway is tied to finding solutions for major ecological challenges connected to salmon lice, escapees, and nutrient emissions from sea cages. At the same time, nutrient-rich sludge from salmon production comprises a valuable resource for the cultivation of lower trophic species using an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) approach. This study aimed to quantify the sedimentation of waste sludge under sea cages of an Atlantic salmon aquaculture site and to qualify the composition of this sludge. Additionally, the study evaluated the potential use of sludge from sea-based aquaculture as a feed source for polychaetes <jats:italic>Hediste diversicolor</jats:italic>. Using sediment traps, sludge samples were collected from two different sea cages, at two different depths, and three different sampling dates. Subsequently, they were quantified, and their composition was assessed with regards to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lipid, fatty acid, protein, amino acid, and ash content as well as elemental ratios and composition of fatty acids and amino acids. The quantity of collected sludge was significantly different between sea cages, with a strong positive correlation between feed input and collected sludge. Sampling depth did not affect the quantity of collected sludge. No significant difference in the proportion of sedimented sludge as a proportion of theoretically produced sludge was found when comparing the different cages and sampling depths. Further, the composition of collected sludge was similar at all sampling points. The overall nutritional value was lower compared to sludge from land-based aquaculture, regardless, sludge from sea-based salmon production can in theory be considered as a potential feed resource to be used for the production of polychaetes <jats:italic>H. diversicolor</jats:italic>.</jats:p>

AB  - End-of-life environmental upgrading can contribute to more sustainable use of natural resources. The authors look at recycling as end-of-life environmental upgrading and explore what influences recycling of discarded hard plastic equipment in the Norwegian aquaculture industry. They study the role of institutional, geographical, and social proximity in environmental upgrading of the plastics value chain in aquaculture and combine the concepts of environmental upgrading, proximity, and cost-capability ratio into a framework to understand better the conditions for end-of-life environmental upgrading. The findings reveal that material properties can be crucial for end-of-life environmental upgrading, as they can both influence costs of environmental upgrading and require development of new capabilities for environmental upgrading. To balance the costs and capabilities related to environmental upgrading, actors need to take geographical, institutional, and social dimensions of proximity into account. In conclusion, the development of recycling solutions in global value chains, such as end- of-life environmental upgrading, is affected by how proximity influences costs and drives development of capabilities.

AB  - Ecology and genetics can influence the fate of individuals and populations in multiple ways. However, to date, few studies consider them when modelling the evolutionary trajectory of populations faced with admixture with non-local populations. For the Atlantic salmon, a model incorporating these elements is urgently needed because many populations are challenged with gene-flow from non-local and domesticated conspecifics. We developed an Individual-Based Salmon Eco-genetic Model (IBSEM) to simulate the demographic and population genetic change of an Atlantic salmon population through its entire life-cycle. Processes such as growth, mortality, and maturation are simulated through stochastic procedures, which take into account environmental variables as well as the genotype of the individuals. IBSEM is based upon detailed empirical data from salmon biology, and parameterized to reproduce the environmental conditions and the characteristics of a wild population inhabiting a Norwegian river. Simulations demonstrated that the model consistently and reliably reproduces the characteristics of the population. Moreover, in absence of farmed escapees, the modelled populations reach an evolutionary equilibrium that is similar to our definition of a ‘wild’ genotype. We assessed the sensitivity of the model in the face of assumptions made on the fitness differences between farm and wild salmon, and evaluated the role of straying as a buffering mechanism against the intrusion of farm genes into wild populations. These results demonstrate that IBSEM is able to capture the evolutionary forces shaping the life history of wild salmon and is therefore able to model the response of populations under environmental and genetic stressors.

AB  - Food waste represents one of the major problems in the food industry, as it accounts for substantial social, economic, and environmental challenges due to the waste of resources along the food supply chain – such as waste of water, land, fertilizer, and energy. Recovering food waste and transforming it into valuable products is essential to reduce the impacts of such losses. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a well-developed and standardized tool for evaluating the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout the supply chain. However, evaluating the impacts and benefits of different food waste valorization and recycling pathways requires a deeper understanding of the different types of substrates and their applications in the consequent supply chain stages. Moreover, in agri-food LCAs, inconsistencies are found regarding the different multifunctionality allocation approaches, especially in contexts where the differentiation between co-production and waste generation is unclear. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to reconcile the aforementioned inconsistencies by (1) analyzing the current practices on allocation decisions in agricultural and other food-related LCAs and (2) providing practical recommendations for decision-making regarding allocation methods for specific types of food co-products and waste streams following the ISO 14044 requirements. Results show that many LCA practitioners are adopting a zero-burden approach (40%) to model the valorization of biomass such as food co-products and/or waste, even if these materials do not conform to the ISO 14044 definition of waste. Only consequential LCAs consistently applied an approach that adheres to the ISO 14044 allocation hierarchy. In attributional LCAs, economic allocation was found to be the most used approach (35%), followed by mass-based allocation (13%), suggesting that much of current practices are inconsistent with the ISO 14044 allocation hierarchy. The results also indicate that most LCA practitioners do not provide transparent justifications of their methodological choices, such as the definitions of co-products and wastes, cut-off criteria, and/or allocation procedures. Conclusively, the following criteria were identified as pertinent factors to consider when addressing to multifunctional food flows in LCA: the goal and scope of the study; a justified definition of the material flow type (co-product/waste); the LCA modeling approach (attributional/consequential); the description of the multifunctional processes (upstream/downstream); and associated allocation methods (compliant with the ISO guidelines).

AB  - North American dining customers like to have a singular large piece of protein in the center of the plate. When fish is the protein of choice, the portion size from many species is limited by the overall size of the fish. Therefore, for these species, the means to achieve a singular larger portion of “center of the plate” protein is to grow a larger animal. However, fish become less efficient in converting feed to protein as they age. A second option would be to provide two smaller fillets originating from younger, more efficient fish. Here, the sustainability ramifications of these two protein provisioning strategies (single large or two small fillets) are considered for three species of fish produced in aquaculture. Growth data for channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) produced in ponds, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in raceways, and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) in marine net pens, were modeled to assess the total biomass and overall food conversion ratio for the production of small, medium or large fish. The production of small fish added an additional 50% or more biomass per year for trout, catfish, and sablefish compared to the production of large fish. Feed conversion ratios were also improved by nearly 10% for the smaller compared to larger fish of each species. Thus, even though all of these species tend to be considered aquaculture species of low environmental impact (and hence “green” or sustainable options), the product form requested by retailers and served by chefs can further increase the sustainability of these species.

AB  - <jats:p>Farmed fish released in a native environment can display different spawning behaviour compared to their wild conspecifics. In our study, farmed and wild burbot, a species recently introduced for aquacultural production, were equipped with electromyogram (EMG) radio tags. EMG biotelemetry allows a description of the spatial distribution of fish together with simultaneous measurements of individual energy consumption. Farmed burbot were released into the wild to simulate stocking or hatchery escape and were observed over a nocturnal phase during November to January. The observational period was assumed to cover the whole spawning season, including an expected peak of spawning activity determined according to egg production by naturally spawning burbot in an experimental seminatural river channel. We detected increased energy consumption and lower movement activity at the time of expected peak spawning for wild burbot only. Across the whole spawning season, farmed females showed lower movement activity and energy consumption than wild females, whereas the opposite results were found for farmed males. Farmed and wild fish kept larger distances between each other than the individuals within a group (farmed and wild) across the whole spawning season. The closest positions occurred between males and females in the wild group, while for farmed fish, the closest position was found within the same sex. Sexually conditioned energy consumption and spatial distribution differed between wild and farmed fish.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) is an important freshwater fisheries resource and popular recreational fishing species in Japan, lives for only one year, and has a single breeding season. To supplement increased recreational fishing demand for this species, huge numbers of wild-born landlocked juveniles have been translocated from Lake Biwa into most Japanese rivers for more than 100 generations. Hatchery-reared juveniles born from captive-reared parents for more than 30 generations have also been extensively released. Previous studies have reported that landlocked and amphidromous forms of Ayu easily hybridise, but survival of landlocked larvae could be very low in seawater, leading to a general consensus among scientists, hatchery managers, and commercial and recreational fishers that the reproductive success of landlocked Ayu is very low, or even 0 in translocated rivers. Despite this, limited information exists regarding the reproductive success of landlocked Ayu in translocated rivers, and no study has evaluated the effects of translocation on population structure. Demonstrating that hybridisation occurs between the two forms is central to future management and conservation of this specie. To address this issue, a comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and three published genetic data sets are analysed. Analyses provide strong evidence for very high gene flow between populations, but population structure has been retained in several regions, and several populations are nested. Allele frequencies are similar in amphidromous and landlocked forms. Genetic diversity is homogeneous in amphidromous populations. Bayesian admixture analysis infers widespread introgression in Japanese rivers, with a mean introgression proportion of 24 ± 8%. Maximum likelihood admixture graphs detect two migration events from Lake Biwa to anadromous populations. Analyses consistently indicate that hybridisation between translocated landlocked juveniles and native amphidromous Ayu occurs throughout Japanese rivers.

AB  - In 1995, the British Columbia Government imposed a moratorium on salmon farming expansion and conducted an environmental assessment review of the industry. Despite the generally favourable conclusions of this review, the government delayed making a decision on the future of the industry for more than 2 years. This issue is examined using a graph model for conflict resolution. The graph model requires only ordinal preferences for the decision-makers and allows the analyst to impose realistic constraints on the conflict such as providing for unidirectional and common moves. Given the preferences of the players involved in the conflict, inaction on the part of the provincial government was a stable solution for 2 years. The deteriorating economic situation in British Columbia combined with an improved public acceptance of the salmon farming industry shifted the solution to one of adopting the recommendations from the environmental assessment review and eventually lifting the moratorium.

AB  - Abstract Environmental issues have been of central importance throughout the history of salmon aquacuiture in Norway. In this paper we will examine some of the issues, and show that while there are still problems, many have also been resolved. A major reason for this is the fact that salmon farmers have internalized many of the environmental effects into their decision‐making due to the relationship between environmental impact and productivity. Another reason, particularly when it comes to treatment of diseases, is that lack of private innovative activity due to different market failures has been compensated for by government‐sponsored research and development.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the population of Chinook salmon has been declining in the Pacific Northwest ecosystem, mostly caused by a combination of increasing demand of Chinook in fisheries, a higher predation pressure, and a decrease in survival and reproductive success due to climate change. This species has long been considered a vital player in the Pacific Northwest ecosystem, so a decline in the population will have several serious effects on other species and the environment. In order to recover the Chinook population, hatcheries were built as an additional source for restocking salmon population. However, the recovery efficiency of hatcheries has long been doubted. In order to find the current salmon population recovery of the Pacific Northwest ecosystem, a continuous study was carried following the same procedure is done by Houwelling et al. last year. Our study focused on 1) whether the increase in the number of returning Chinook last year was an outlier or not, and 2) testing if the population of Chinook salmon is still decreasing in terms of the number of salmon returning to the hatchery. Data was collected by counting the number of Chinook returning over one hour period. By averaging the number of five trails and calculating the estimated total number of returning, we compared this year's estimation with the estimation calculated in the previous study. The result showed an increasing returning number (W = 46, p-value =0.006) compared to the 2017 returning number. Our result showed a significantly greater return number of Chinook salmon in 2018 than the return number the previous study estimated in 2017.

AB  - Abstract Norway is the largest producers of aquaculture salmon in the world, and the Bergen region is the centre of Norwegian salmon production. In this article we explore the opportunities and obstacles in introducing cell-based seafood as a new related industry niche in the region through coevolution with the established salmon farming industry. Introducing a new industry niche to this region could contribute to a comprehensive renewal of existing seafood-related activity and represent a major step towards sustainable seafood production. Cell-based seafood may eliminate sea lice, escapee and excess nutrient impacts on the surroundings by enabling highly controlled and contained seafood production. We found that coevolution between the cell-based seafood sector and the salmon industry in the Bergen region will be difficult to materialize at the present time. There are two main explanations. First, coevolution is challenging when the dominant path (i.e., salmon farming) is in a stable state. High profitability and a stable state mean that this industry absorbs investors, technology suppliers and research milieus that may otherwise have been on the lookout for alternatives and supplementary business opportunities. It also means that incumbents within the dominant path will not be looking for diversification alternatives. Secondly, there are distinct differences between the two industry paths when it comes to knowledge base, innovation mode and geographical configurations, making actor mobility, knowledge spillovers and resource sharing between the two industry paths challenging. We also find that coevolution may occur in the future through industrial convergent evolution mechanisms of downstream value chains as the cell-based seafood industry matures.

AB  - Fjord ecosystems cycle and export significant amounts of carbon and appear to be extremely sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic perturbations. To identify patterns of microbial responses to ongoing natural and human-derived changes in the fjords of Chilean Patagonia, we examined the effect of organic enrichment associated with salmon aquaculture and freshening produced by glacial melting on bacterial production (BP), extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA), and community diversity of free-living bacterioplankton. We assayed the effects of salmon food-derived dissolved organic matter (SF-DOM) and meltwaters through microcosm experiments containing waters from Puyuhuapi Fjord and the proglacial fjords of the Southern Patagonia Icefield, respectively. Rates of BP and EEA were 2 times higher in the presence of SF-DOM than in controls, whereas the addition of autochthonous organic matter derived from diatoms (D-DOM) resulted in rates of BP and EEA similar to those measured in the controls. The addition of SF-DOM also reduced species richness and abundance of a significant fraction of the representative taxa of bacterioplankton of Puyuhuapi Fjord. In the proglacial fjords, bacterioplankton diversity was reduced in areas more heavily influenced by meltwaters and was accompanied by moderate positive changes in BP and EEA. Our findings strongly suggest that SF-DOM is highly reactive, promoting enhanced rates of microbial activity while could be influencing the diversity of bacterioplankton communities in Patagonian fjords with a strong salmon farming activity. These findings challenge the traditional view of phytoplankton production as the primary source of labile DOM that fuels heterotrophic activity in coastal ecosystems impacted by anthropogenic organic enrichment. Given the intensive local production of salmon, we analyze the significance of this emerging source of rich "allochthonous" organic substrates for autotrophic/heterotrophic balance, carbon exportation, and hypoxia in Patagonian fjords. The effect of human DOM enrichment can be enhanced in proglacial fjords, where progressive glacial melting exerts additional selective pressure on bacterioplankton diversity.

AB  - Escaped transgenic organisms (GMO's) may threaten the populations of their wild relatives if able to hybridize with each other. The introgression of a growth enhancement transgene into a wild Atlantic salmon population may be affected by the transgene's effects not only on fitness parameters, but also on mating behaviour. Large anadromous GMO males are most preferred in mating, but a transgene can also give the large sneakers a reproductive advantage over the smaller wild individuals. With a simulation model, we studied whether the increase in the proportion and mating success of sneakers in transgenic and hybrid genotypes could facilitate the introgression of a transgene into wild population after the release of GMOs. The model combines population dynamics and Mendelian inheritance of a transgenic trait. We found that the introgression of the transgene is strongly affected by the greater mating preference of large GMO males. Furthermore, the difference in reproductive success between the anadromous versus sneaker strategy defines how much GMO's have to be preferred to be able to invade. These results emphasize the importance of detailed knowledge of reproductive systems and the effect of a transgene on the phenotype and behaviour of GMOs when assessing the consequences of their release or escape to the wild.

AB  - Abstract With high productivity and low land and water use, controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) like aquaponics and hydroponics has become a promising solution to feed the rapidly growing global population. However, both aquaponic and hydroponic systems require high energy input, leading to potential environmental burdens. This cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA), for the first time, compared the environmental performance, on an economic basis, of aquaponics and hydroponics with identical system design in Indiana, US. For a one-month cultivation period, tilapia and six vegetables produced in the aquaponic system had almost twice the total value of the vegetables from the hydroponic system. Aquaponics produced 45% lower endpoint environmental impact than hydroponics. Electricity use for greenhouse heating and lighting, and water pumping and heating contributed to the majority of the environmental impacts of both systems, which was followed by the production of fish feed and fertilizers. However, changing the energy source from coal to wind power could make the hydroponic system more environment-friendly than the aquaponic system. This LCA study can provide CEA farmers with the groundwork to reduce the environmental cost of their production.

AB  - Anadromous brown trout (sea trout), Salmo trutta, is currently in decline throughout its range, largely due to anthropogenic stressors in freshwater and marine habitats. Acoustic telmetry was utilized to study the marine migration of sea trout post-smolts from three populations in a relatively pristine subarctic fjord system. While at sea, the sea trout spent a substantial part of their time close to their natal river, preferred near shore over pelagic habitats and were strongly surface oriented. Despite a fidelity towards local areas, the sea trout utilized various parts of the fjord system, with maximum dispersion >30 km and total migration distance >300 km. Almost half of the sea trout (44%) migrated between river outlets, indicating that a metapopulation approach may be appropriate when managing neighbouring sea trout populations at high latitudes. Furthermore, the different populations displayed different migratory behaviours in terms of distance migrated, dispersion from origin and the likelihood of leaving their home area. This variation in migratory behaviour is likely influenced by spatiotemporal differences in habitat quality between sites, indicating that local habitat variations may promote population-specific behavioural responses even in relatively confined fjord systems.

AB  - In sea cage fish farming, production quotas aim to constrain the impact of fish farming on the surrounding ecosystem. It is unknown how these quotas affect economic profitability and environmental impact of genetic improvement. We combined bioeconomic modelling with life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate the economic (EV) and environmental (ENV) values of thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of sea bass reared in sea cages, given four types of quota commonly used in Europe: annual production (Qprod), annual feed distributed (Qannual_feed), standing stock (Qstock), and daily feed distributed (Qdaily_feed). ENV were calculated for LCA impact categories climate change, eutrophication and acidification. ENV were expressed per ton of fish produced per year (ENV(fish)) and per farm per year (ENV(farm)). Results show that irrespective of quota used, EV of FCR as well as ENV(fish) and ENV(farm) were always positive, meaning that improving FCR increased profit and decreased environmental impacts. However, the EV and the ENV(fish) of TGC were positive only when quota was Qstock or Qdaily_feed. Moreover, the ENV(farm) of TGC was negative in Qstock and Qdaily_feed quotas, meaning that improving TGC increased the environmental impact of the farm. We conclude that Qstock quota and Qdaily_feed quota are economically favorable to a genetic improvement of TGC, a major trait for farmers. However, improving TGC increases the environmental impact of the farm. Improving FCR represents a good opportunity to balance out this increase but more information on its genetic background is needed to develop breeding programs improving FCR.

AB  - After decades of discussion, there is little consensus on the extent to which hybrids between endangered and nonendangered species should be protected by US law. As increasingly larger, genome-scale data sets are developed, we can identify individuals and populations with even trace levels of genetic admixture, making the 'hybrid problem' all the more difficult. We developed a decision-tree framework for evaluating hybrid protection, including both the processes that produced hybrids (human-mediated or natural) and the ecological impact of hybrids on natural ecosystems. We then evaluated our decision tree for four case studies drawn from our own work and briefly discuss several other cases from the literature. Throughout, we highlight the management outcomes that our approach provides and the nuances of hybridization as a conservation problem.

AB  - The evolution of pathogenic microorganisms that can resist a wide range of antimicrobial treatments leading to treatment failure and loss of human and animal life represents one of the most thoughtful public health concerns in the world. The marine ecosystem is now increasingly recognized as a potentially significant "hotspot" for the emergence, maintenance, and dispersal of many clinically relevant and potentially novel AMR genes and microbes. The trends on AMR surges in marine life are the reflections of the conditions in humans. AMR in the marine ecosystem is a natural and ancient phenomenon, albeit higher levels are always related to increased human activities. Various marine pollutants and indiscriminate use of chemicals, including antimicrobials, in aquaculture practices contribute to AMR in the marine ecosystem. Antimicrobials used to treat infections in coastal aquaculture practices can get into the marine environment, which could adversely impact the marine biodiversity and terrestrial animal and human health consequent to the selection of AMR bacteria and AMR genes. Persistent pollutants like plastics function as important vectors for the dissemination of AMR bacteria into the marine ecosystem. As there are several ways these AMR bacteria and genes can be conveyed back to terrestrial animals and humans, AMR surges in the marine ecosystem represent a significant zoonotic health risk. The present chapter summarizes the current knowledge on AMR in the marine ecosystem and the major future research perspectives in the area.

AB  - Abstract Environmental sustainability of aquaculture is a complex issue involving effects at local (e.g. benthic deterioration), regional (e.g. eutrophication) and global (e.g. catches for feed production) scales as a consequence of farming operations (e.g. waste emissions) and industrial processes involved in the product value chain. Integrating these effects using a holistic and multi-scale framework is essential to assess the environmental sustainability of innovative production systems such as Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA), in which organisms of different trophic levels are co-cultured on the same farm to minimize aquaculture waste. The environmental performances of theoretical production scenarios of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) sea cage monoculture and an open-water IMTA co-culturing of red drum and sea cucumber (Holothuria scabra) were assessed with mathematical models at local and global scales. First, the particulate waste bioremediation potential of sea cucumber production was estimated using an individual-based bioenergetic model. Second, environmental impacts of the monoculture and the IMTA systems were estimated and compared using life cycle assessment (LCA), calculated per kg of edible protein and t of product, including uncertainty analysis. Given the current limits to stocking density observed for sea cucumbers, its co-culture in sea cages suspended beneath finfish nets may decrease slightly (by 0.73%) farm net particulate waste load and benthic impact. The monoculture and IMTA showed little difference in impact because of the large difference in production scales of finfish and sea cucumber species. Removing 100% of finfish feces particulate waste requires cultivating sea cucumber at scale similar to that of finfish (1.3 kg of sea cucumber per kg of finfish). Nonetheless, LCA showed trends in IMTA performance: lower eutrophication impact and net primary production use but higher cumulative energy demand and climate change impacts, generating an impact transfer between categories. Intensification of sea cucumber culture could increase local and global environmental benefits, but further research is necessary to design rearing units that can optimize production and/or bioremediation and that can be practically integrated into existing finfish monoculture units. The methodology defined here can be a powerful tool to predict the magnitude of environmental benefits that can be expected from new and complex production systems and to show potential impact transfer between spatial scales. We recommend applying it to other IMTA systems and species associations and including socio-economic criteria to fully assess the sustainability of future seafood production systems.

AB  - Inland fish farming is one of the growing food industries in India. The potential of this sector in creating an impact on the growth of the Indian economy is not yet realized. The Government of India is constantly focusing on various opportunities to build a self-reliant nation. Fish is one of the major foods consumed by the people of Southern India. Improper maintenance of aquafarms leads to health problems for the people who consume fish from these farms. In this paper, the types of fish farming, the challenges, threats, and recent remedial actions taken to overcome the challenges are discussed. A low-cost water quality monitoring system (WQMS) based on long-range wireless communication (LoRaWC) powered by a solar panel that floats on the water is proposed to improve the yield and quality of fish from the aquafarms. The sensor node is designed to measure pH level, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), atmospheric temperature, humidity, and water level. The measured values are transmitted to the cloud through a LoRa gateway for taking necessary decisions to maintain the water quality in good condition. This method improves the growth and health of the fish in the aquafarm which in turn provides healthy food for mankind.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The mucosal surfaces of fish represent an important barrier that supports and regulates a diverse array of microbial assemblages and contributes to the overall health and fitness of the host. For farmed species, knowledge of how these host–microbial systems adapt and respond to various stressors is pivotal for managing health, nutrition and optimizing productivity in aquaculture. While our understanding of these communities and the factors that shape them now suggest that a diverse balanced microbiota is critical for healthy functioning in fish, the mechanisms behind these interactions are still poorly understood. Much of the existing research has focused on characterizing the taxonomic diversity of these assemblages in different fish species, across body surfaces (e.g. skin, gills and gastrointestinal tract), and in response to changing nutrition, health and environmental conditions. However, the specific functional contributions of these communities (or specific members) remain elusive, especially in farmed or diseased fish. Here, we review our current understanding of the microbiota in fish, their interplay and the likely functional involvement with the host. We also seek to address and identify gaps in knowledge and explore the future prospects for improving our understanding of these communities in aquaculture.</jats:p>

AB  - The current review is directed to workers in aquaculture, fish handlers, consumers, private and governmental fish industry producers and researchers. They should consider the possible occupational hazards and follow regulations and legislations adopted. The occupational hazards, safety concerns and risks to health in the aquaculture industry are based on the types of operation, scale of production and the specific species of interest. Hazard is a biological, chemical, or physical agent with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. Fish grown in excreta-fertilized or wastewater ponds may be contaminated with pathogens. Transgenic fish is hazardous because of their potential allergenicity and toxicity. Awareness of the health hazards involved in the handling of industrial fish is important, particularly for those working in the vicinity of fishin g communities. Farmhands and other workers in aquafarms are susceptible to many injuries, noise, sting from fish spines, sprain and fracture which are of physical hazards. Spoiled wet fish in storage may produce poisonous gases. Fish muscle can hold different concentration of Hg representing health risk to fertile women. Cadmium and lead concentrations are higher in fish scales and vertebral column than in the other parts of the fish. The author's objective is to improve the health and safety of workers in aquaculture through the recognition, evaluation, control or mitigation of human health risk in the aquaculture industry. Focusing on the possible role of aquatic farming in the spread of communicable human diseases.

AB  - During their third and fourth years of life, triploid Atlantic cod Gadus morhua females exhibited diminished ovarian development at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, with significantly lower gonado-somatic indices (IG) and higher carcass yields (YC) than diploid females during spawning periods. In contrast, diploid and triploid testes were indistinguishable through macroscopic and histological assessment. No significant differences were found in male IG or YC in relation to ploidy, with the exception of a higher YC for triploids during the first of the two monitored spawning seasons. As a result of suppressed oogenesis, triploid female G. morhua, but not triploid males, can be used to eliminate sexual maturation in this species and advance the development of the G. morhua aquaculture industry.

AB  - <i>Piscirickettsia salmonis</i> is the most important health problem facing Chilean Aquaculture. Previous reports suggest that <i>P. salmonis</i> can survive in salmonid macrophages by interfering with the host immune response. However, the relevant aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of <i>P. salmonis</i> have been poorly characterized. In this work, we evaluated the transcriptomic changes in macrophage-like cell line SHK-1 infected with <i>P. salmonis</i> at 24- and 48-hours post-infection (hpi) and generated network models of the macrophage response to the infection using co-expression analysis and regulatory transcription factor-target gene information. Transcriptomic analysis showed that 635 genes were differentially expressed after 24- and/or 48-hpi. The pattern of expression of these genes was analyzed by weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), which classified genes into 4 modules of expression, comprising early responses to the bacterium. Induced genes included genes involved in metabolism and cell differentiation, intracellular transportation, and cytoskeleton reorganization, while repressed genes included genes involved in extracellular matrix organization and RNA metabolism. To understand how these expression changes are orchestrated and to pinpoint relevant transcription factors (TFs) controlling the response, we established a curated database of TF-target gene regulatory interactions in <i>Salmo salar</i>, SalSaDB. Using this resource, together with co-expression module data, we generated infection context-specific networks that were analyzed to determine highly connected TF nodes. We found that the most connected TF of the 24- and 48-hpi response networks is KLF17, an ortholog of the KLF4 TF involved in the polarization of macrophages to an M2-phenotype in mammals. Interestingly, while KLF17 is induced by <i>P. salmonis</i> infection, other TFs, such as NOTCH3 and NFATC1, whose orthologs in mammals are related to M1-like macrophages, are repressed. In sum, our results suggest the induction of early regulatory events associated with an M2-like phenotype of macrophages that drives effectors related to the lysosome, RNA metabolism, cytoskeleton organization, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Moreover, the M1-like response seems delayed in generating an effective response, suggesting a polarization towards M2-like macrophages that allows the survival of <i>P. salmonis</i>. This work also contributes to SalSaDB, a curated database of TF-target gene interactions that is freely available for the Atlantic salmon community.

AB  - Abstract Human activities create more reactive nitrogen than is created through natural processes every year. The excess reactive nitrogen in the environment causes various negative effects including eutrophication, climate change, acidification, and human health problems. The sources of the excess nitrogen are mainly fertilizers and animal and human waste generated by food production and consumption. Therefore, our food choices have major effects on the nitrogen load to the environment. To quantify the load, a consumption-based accounting tool, called the nitrogen footprint, has been recently developed. In current nitrogen footprint models, seafood is calculated as a single category using the same simple assumptions as livestock. However, there is a variety of types and methods of production of seafood. In addition, world per capita consumption of seafood is projected to continue expanding. In this paper, we propose a new nitrogen footprint model to evaluate the impact of seafood in detail, present the results of the model applied to Japan as a case study, and explain the important parameters that are needed to accurately evaluate the load of seafood consumption. Our model tracks the feeding steps in detail, considering differences among fed aquacultured seafood, non-fed aquacultured seafood (mainly bivalves and filter-feeding carp), and captured seafood. Our model evaluates the Japanese food nitrogen footprint of fed aquacultured seafood as 0.7 kg-N/capita/year, ca. 45% of that of all seafood, whereas the previous model evaluates it as 3.36 kg-N/capita/year. Our results demonstrate that the key factors for assessing the nitrogen load of seafood are the proportions of fed aquaculture and of plant protein in feed. In order to enable food choices that will effectively reduce nitrogen release, we provide the virtual N factors (per intake nitrogen release during production) for different seafood as 0.2 (non-fed aquacultured and captured), 4.8 (freshwater and diadromous fish), 3.9 (demersal fish), 3.4 (pelagic fish and other marine fish), and 8.2 (crustaceans). Our results show that eating more non-fed aquacultured and captured seafood and less fed-aquacultured shrimps and prawns could reduce our nitrogen load from food consumption as effectively as choosing poultry instead of beef. Although its evaluation is limited to nitrogen load related to food itself and not including the load from energy use, etc., our detailed nitrogen footprint model for different seafood categories and production sources can quantify the effectiveness of policies and actions that link sustainable consumption and sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, contributing toward the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

AB  - The naturally occurring ectoparasite salmon lice (Lepeophtherirus salmonis) poses a great challenge for the salmon farming industry, as well as for wild salmonids in the Northern hemisphere. To better control the infestation pressure and protect the production, there is a need to provide fish farmers with sensitive and efficient tools for rapid early detection and monitoring of the parasitic load. This can be achieved by targeting L. salmonis DNA in environmental samples. Here, we developed and tested a new L. salmonis specific DNA-based assay (qPCR assay) for detection and quantification from seawater samples using an analytical pipeline compatible with the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) for autonomous water sample analysis of gene targets. Specificity of the L. salmonis qPCR assay was demonstrated through in-silico DNA analyses covering sequences of different L. salmonis isolates. Seawater was spiked with known numbers of nauplii and copepodite free-swimming (planktonic) stages of L. salmonis to investigate the relationship with the number of marker gene copies (MGC). Finally, field samples collected at different times of the year in the vicinity of a salmon production farm in Western Norway were analyzed for L. salmonis detection and quantification. The assay specificity was high and a high correlation between MGC and planktonic stages of L. salmonis was established in the laboratory conditions. In the field, L. salmonis DNA was consequently detected, but with MGC number below that expected for one copepodite or nauplii. We concluded that only L. salmonis tissue or eDNA residues were detected. This novel study opens for a fully automatized L. salmonis DNA quantification using ESP robotic to monitor the parasitic load, but challenges remain to exactly transfer information about eDNA quantities to decisions by the farmers and possible interventions.

AB  - <jats:p>Caged salmon farming is increasingly undertaken in water bodies with strong hydrodynamics where hard and mixed substrate habitats are more prevalent. Yet, these structurally complex and heterogeneous habitats support diverse benthic communities including several cnidarians and sponges that remain poorly characterized. This study used a combination of respirometry measurements, gas chromatography and 16S rRNA metabarcoding to define the respiration rate, stable carbon (δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C) and nitrogen isotopes (δ<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N), fatty acid (FA) and microbial profiles, and assess the impact of salmon farming on four important epibenthic suspension-feeders along the western Norwegian coast: the sponges <jats:italic>Craniella</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Weberella</jats:italic>, the soft coral <jats:italic>Duva florida</jats:italic> and the anemone <jats:italic>Hormathia digitata</jats:italic>. Our results showed striking differences in fatty acid profiles and host microbiome communities in terms of identity, functional capabilities and genetic properties across the suspension-feeders. We found evidence of increased mortality rate in specimens located near fish farm activities and of a species-specific effect on respiration rate, with <jats:italic>D. florida</jats:italic> showing increased activity under the farm. Effects of fish farming on the suspension feeders were also species-specific and particularly evidenced by functional microbial turnover and by alteration of overall FA profiles in the soft coral and sea anemone. In particular, <jats:italic>D. florida</jats:italic> showed reduced level of FAs close to the farm (0-350 m), with significant difference in composition along a distance gradient. Only <jats:italic>H. digitata</jats:italic> showed evidence of incorporation of organic material from the fish farm waste <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> fatty acids trophic markers (FATM) and stable isotope analysis. Overall, our study demonstrates that suspension feeders have taxon-specific sensitivity towards the effect of salmon farming, and identified several potential molecular indicators that could be used as surrogate of impact gradient upon further research and validation. It also provides a wealth of ecological and physiological information on some of the most common sessile epibenthic organisms within Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, enabling us to better understand their response and evaluate their resilience to environmental changes.</jats:p>

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of the rent tax announcement and implementation in Norway in sea-based salmonid aquaculture on stock returns of affected companies. Our sample period ranges from August 2, 2022 to February 1, 2023, covering both the announcement and implementation day. By applying a difference-in-differences approach, we measure the causal effect that the rent tax had on the returns of the affected companies (companies that operate in Norway) relative to the non-affected companies (those that operate outside of Norway). Our findings reveal a statistically significant, large negative return in the affected companies on the announcement day. Return on implementation day was close to zero. This result is consistent with the efficient market hypothesis, where only new information should move stock prices.

AB  - The use of antibiotics in aquaculture is a common infection treatment and is increasing in some sectors and jurisdictions. While antibiotic treatment can negatively shift gut bacterial communities, recovery and examination of these communities in fish of commercial importance is not well documented. Examining the impacts of antibiotics on farmed fish microbiota is fundamental for improving our understanding and management of healthy farmed fish. This work assessed yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) skin and gut bacterial communities after an oral antibiotic combination therapy in poor performing fish that displayed signs of enteritis over an 18-day period. In an attempt to promote improved bacterial re-establishment after antibiotic treatment, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was also administered via gavage or in the surrounding seawater, and its affect was evaluated over 15 days post-delivery. Antibiotic treatment greatly perturbed the global gut bacterial communities of poor-performing fish – an effect that lasted for up to 18 days post treatment. This perturbation was marked by a significant decrease in species diversity and evenness, as well as a concomitant increase in particular taxa like an uncultured Mycoplasmataceae sp., which persisted and dominated antibiotic-treated fish for the entire 18-day period. The skin-associated bacterial communities were also perturbed by the antibiotic treatment, notably within the first 3 days; however, this was unlike the gut, as skin microbiota appeared to shift towards a more ‘normal’ (though disparate) state after 5 days post antibiotic treatment. FMT was only able to modulate the impacts of antibiotics in some individuals for a short time period, as the magnitude of change varied substantially between individuals. Some fish maintained certain transplanted gut taxa (i.e. present in the FMT inoculum; namely various Aliivibrio related ASVs) at Day 2 post FMT, although these were lost by Day 8 post FMT. As we observed notable, prolonged perturbations induced by antibiotics on the gut bacterial assemblages, further work is required to better understand the processes/dynamics of their re-establishment following antibiotic exposure. In this regard, procedures like FMT represent a novel approach for promoting improved microbial recovery, although their efficacy and the factors that support their success requires further investigation.

AB  - Because of intrinsic differences in their genetic architectures, wild populations invaded by domesticated individuals could experience population-specific consequences following introgression by genetic material of domesticated origin. Expression levels of 16 000 transcripts were quantified by microarrays in liver tissue from farm, wild, and farm-wild backcross (i.e. F1 farm-wild hybrid × wild; total n = 50) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) raised under common environmental conditions. The wild populations and farm strain originated from three North American rivers in eastern Canada (Stewiacke, Tusket, and Saint John rivers, respectively). Analysis of variance revealed 177 transcripts with different expression levels among the five strains compared. Five times more of these transcripts were differentiated between farmed parents and Tusket backcrosses (n = 53) than between Stewiacke backcrosses and their farmed parents (n = 11). Altered biological processes in backcrosses also differed between populations both in number and in the type of processes impacted (metabolism vs immunity). Over-dominant gene expression regulation in backcrosses varied considerably between populations (23% in Stewiacke vs 44% in Tusket). Hence, the consequences of introgression of farm genetic material on gene expression depended on population-specific genetic architectures. These results support the need to evaluate impacts of farm-wild genetic interactions at the population scale.

AB  - Negotiations on a Canada-US Pacific salmon treaty began in 1908 but the first comprehensive treaty was not achieved until 1985. After a short period of cooperation, the treaty was undermined by arguments over catch sharing and the failure to rebuild some important salmon stocks. A revised treaty, agreed upon in 1999, established conservation of salmon as a priority and included a side-payment, in the form of two endowment funds designed in part to appease Canadian concern over catch imbalances. In this paper, the graph model for conflict resolution is used to examine the stability of the revised salmon treaty. The assessment suggests that the treaty is stable if the side-payment is maintained or enhanced, even if both countries pursue aggressive fishing strategies. If the side-payment is not maintained, then it is likely that all groups attempt to maximize their catch and Canada seeks a renegotiation of the treaty.

AB  - Parasites may have large effects on host population dynamics, marine fisheries and conservation, but a clear elucidation of their impact is limited by a lack of ecosystem-scale experimental data. We conducted a meta-analysis of replicated manipulative field experiments concerning the influence of parasitism by crustaceans on the marine survival of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The data include 24 trials in which tagged smolts (totalling 283347 fish; 1996–2008) were released as paired control and parasiticide-treated groups into 10 areas of Ireland and Norway. All experimental fish were infectionfree when released into freshwater, and a proportion of each group was recovered as adult recruits returning to coastal waters 1 or more years later. Treatment had a significant positive effect on survival to recruitment, with an overall effect size (odds ratio) of 1.29 that corresponds to an estimated loss of 39 per cent (95% CI: 18–55%) of adult salmon recruitment. The parasitic crustaceans were probably acquired during early marine migration in areas that host large aquaculture populations of domesticated salmon, which elevate local abundances of ectoparasitic copepods—particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis. These results provide experimental evidence from a large marine ecosystem that parasites can have large impacts on fish recruitment, fisheries and conservation.

AB  - Sec lice infections are recognized as a primary challenge for both salmon farming and adjacent stocks of wild salmon and sea trout, triggering strict regulations at farm sites and in larger coastal production areas. In 2017 the Norwegian government implemented the Traffic Light System (TLS), where green, yellow, and red lights imply that salmon farmers can raise, maintain, or must reduce production quantities depending on estimated sea lice-induced mortality of wild salmonids. Past research has explored the impacts of sea lice on the growth rate of salmon, indicating a possible link between sea lice numbers and harvest practices. This study evaluates the impact of sea lice on salmon farmers' harvest behavior focusing on production quantities and fish sizes while controlling for market prices of salmon and fish meal. We also investigate whether and to what extent the TLS implementation affects harvest behavior. Our empirical results indicate that farmers tend to harvest marginally faster in response to increasing levels of sea lice and slower during delousing operations. The implementation of the TLS strengthened the negative impacts of delousing operations on harvest quantities. Fish sizes at harvest are negatively associated with sea lice levels and delousing operations, regardless of the implementation of the TLS. Control variables, such as seawater temperature, salmon prices, and fish meal prices, also influence harvest quantities and fish sizes.

AB  - This study provides a comprehensive review of the environmental impacts associated with seaweed cultivation and utilization in various industries, focusing on life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. There is a remarkable disparity in the distribution of LCA studies. Asia produces 97 % of the global seaweed, but accounts for only 25 % of LCA research. In contrast, Europe, which produces only 0.8 % of the global seaweed production, is responsible for 70 % of the studies. Current cultivation practices result in low emissions of 0.02–0.08 CO2-equivalents (CO2 eq)/kg of wet seaweed. Cultivation may yield climate benefits if biogenic carbon uptake and sequestration are considered. However, the stability of the stored carbon requires further research. Seaweeds have significant potential in various sectors, including bioenergy, food, feed, fertilizer, nanomaterials, construction, and cosmetics, supporting a circular bioeconomy. However, environmental hotspots include energy use for drying, fuel for transport, infrastructure production, and the processing phase. Various mitigation strategies include recirculation and utilization of by-products, extending infrastructure life, recycling infrastructure, using biodegradable materials, adopting renewable energy for drying, optimizing seaweed productivity and the content of valuable ingredients, refining system design for resource efficiency, developing biorefineries, and investigating alternative seaweed species. The diverse functional units used in LCAs limit comparisons between studies. Challenges in seaweed LCA research include the lack of standardized methodologies for varied production systems, cultivation impacts on local ecosystems, data limitations, and often comparisons of seaweed to terrestrial alternatives. Seaweed has the potential to promote sustainability in certain sectors. However, further research is needed to optimize seaweeds as a sustainable resource.

AB  - Abstract Chinese sea perch (Lateolabrax Maculatus) is one of the main marine fish culture species in China, its green development has received increasing attention and its ecological economic study is rare. Based on field survey, this paper takes water pollution tax of China as conversion indicator for aquaculture eutrophication to simulate aquaculture waste fee for further analyzing the ecological impact of Chinese sea perch's aquaculture. For data analysis, data envelopment analysis model has been used. The comparison for Chinese sea perch's economic performance and ecological economic performance under its main aquaculture systems has been done. The results show that: 1. The simulated waste fee has no significant impact for the comparison. 2. Ranking for ecological economic performance's ecological economic, technical and scale efficiency is as follow: pond farming, offshore cage culture and cage culture. 3. Offshore cage culture is the only system presenting positive increase for ecological economic performance, which makes its aquaculture activity more sustainable than other systems. 4. The key point of green development is to maximize the ecological economic efficiency of main aquaculture systems. Thus, offshore cage culture is the most sustainable aquaculture system among China's current marine fish culture systems, and other systems need innovation for achieving the green development of China's aquaculture.

AB  - Summary

1. There is growing evidence that sexually mature but morphologically juvenile males of Atlantic salmon (precocious or mature male parr) actively participate in reproduction and, therefore, in the genetic composition of the populations of this species. The impact of mature male parr on the effective population size (Ne) of such populations has been previously studied under experimental settings, but no studies have been performed directly on natural populations.



2. Continuous monitoring and sampling of all sea returns is possible in the Lerez River (northwest of Spain). From demographic data on variances of reproductive success and genetic data from six microsatellite marker loci we carried out parentage assignment and assessed the impact of male parr on demographic and genetic estimates of Ne in two consecutive years.



3. Our results reveal that: (i) approximately 60% of the total sire paternity is attributable to mature parr; (ii) mature parr decrease the variance of reproductive success of males by a threefold factor and increase the effective population size of males by a 10-fold factor; (iii) however, they do not substantially affect the variance of reproductive success and the effective size of females; (iv) mature parr increase two-to threefold the overall effective size of the population but the ratio Ne/N, where N is the population size including or not mature parr in each case, is not affected.

AB  - Aquaculture is a critical food source for the world's growing population, producing 52% of the aquatic animal products consumed. Marine aquaculture (mariculture) generates 37.5% of this production and 97% of the world's seaweed harvest. Mariculture products may offer a climate-friendly, high-protein food source, because they often have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints than do the equivalent products farmed on land. However, sustainable intensification of low-emissions mariculture is key to maintaining a low GHG footprint as production scales up to meet future demand. We examine the major GHG sources and carbon sinks associated with fed finfish, macroalgae and bivalve mariculture, and the factors influencing variability across sectors. We highlight knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for GHG emissions reductions and carbon storage, including accounting for interactions between mariculture operations and surrounding marine ecosystems. By linking the provision of maricultured products to GHG abatement opportunities, we can advance climate-friendly practices that generate sustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: Aquaculture encompasses a variety of species in both freshwater and marine settings and can combine elements of agriculture and fishing, two recognized hazardous occupations. Efforts are underway to expand the aquaculture sector in the United States (U.S.), and should be informed by occupational safety and health (OSH) research. The objectives of this review paper are to: i) describe the U.S. aquaculture sector, ii) summarize statistics, peer-reviewed studies, and reports focused on U.S. aquaculture OSH, and iii) describe the policy landscape specific to U.S. aquaculture OSH.Methods: Literature searches employed databases and Internet search engines to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles, reports, and other resources. Due to the expected U.S. expansion of marine aquaculture and paucity of peer-reviewed U.S.-based OSH literature in this sector, additional searches for international research on marine aquaculture were conducted.Results: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated high rates of illness and injury among U.S. aquaculture workers in 2014 and 2015. Peer-reviewed literature on aquaculture OSH identified numerous physical, chemical, and biological OSH risks depending on production methods and settings. Significant policy gaps exist regarding U.S. aquaculture OSH surveillance, reporting, and regulation.Conclusion: This review identifies a critical need for research, surveillance, and best practices information, specific to the major types of aquaculture in the U.S., to augment and inform worker safety and health efforts in this expanding sector.

AB  - The recreational bait trade is a potential pathway for pathogen introduction and spread when anglers dump bait shop sourced water into aquatic systems. Despite this possibility, and previous recognition of the importance of the bait trade in the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS), to date there has been no region wide survey documenting pathogens in retail bait shops. In this study, we analyzed 96 environmental DNA samples from retail bait shops around the Great Lakes region to identify pathogens, targeting the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Additionally, we used samples from one site in Lake Michigan as a comparison to pathogen diversity and abundance in natural aquatic systems. Our results identified nine different groups of pathogens in the bait shop samples, including those that pose risks to both humans and fish species. Compared to wild sourced samples, the bait shops had higher relative abundance and greater taxonomic diversity. These findings suggest that the bait trade represents a potentially important pathway that could introduce and spread pathogens throughout the Great Lakes region. Improving pathogen screening and angler outreach should be used in combination to aid in preventing the future spread of high risk pathogens.

AB  - Ectoparasitic salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestations are costly for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farmers in Norway. As a result, there is a strong desire for solutions to prevent and control infestations, and new technologies are typically developed and commercialised rapidly, without rigorous validation. Here, we tested the efficacy of a new commercially available control measure-delousing by underwater lasers-using a replicated design at full commercial scale. Laser delousing was used in combination with a preventive method (snorkel cages), with laser nodes deployed in 3 of the 6 sea cages at the site. The trial ran for 54 days, after which time there was no difference in infestation density of mobile salmon louse stages (pre-adult, adult male or adult female) in cages with or without laser nodes installed. By the end of the trial, adult female lice numbers in all cages were close to the legislated trigger for mandatory delousing (0.5 adult female lice per fish). The laser nodes delivered a large number of pulses relative to the number of lice in the cages, indicating that a lack of lethality rather than a lack of target detection was the limiting factor. If all pulses had been effective, they should have removed between 4-38 % of mobile lice each day. There was no effect on salmon welfare indicators such as skin condition or eye status. Our results highlight the importance of rigorous validation of new technologies across a range of conditions before widespread implementation by industry.

AB  - To develop an alternative bio-control measure for multi-drug resistant pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila, which causes motile Aeromonas septicemia in fish, novel virulent phage (AHP-1) was isolated from carp tissues. Morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealed that AHP-1 belongs to Myoviridae family. AHP-1 displayed 81% of moderate adsorption by 25 min, and latent period of 40 min with burst size of 97 PFU mL-1 at an optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1. AHP-1 was stable over a broad range of pH (4-11), temperature (4-50 °C), and salinity (0.1-3.5%). Both time and MOI dependent in vitro A. hydrophila growth inhibition was observed with AHP-1. AHP-1 (10 MOI) showed higher growth inhibition against A. hydrophila than chloramphenicol (5 μg mL-1), and combined treatment was more promising than individuals. Immune gene expression analysis of zebrafish upon continuous bath exposure to AHP-1 resulted significantly higher (il-6 and sod-1) or slight induction (tnf-α, il1-β, il-10, and cxcl-8a) than controls at beginning of the phage exposure, but those lowered to basal level by day 12 post-phage exposure. It suggests no adverse immune responses have occurred for the AHP-1 dose that used, and have potential for the phage therapy. Further detailed in vivo studies are needed to confirm the protective efficacy of newly isolated AHP-1 against A. hydrophila infection.

               <jats:p>Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease has been a major challenge faced by white shrimp farmers in many shrimp-producing countries inducing Indonesia. The etiological agent of this disease was a virulent strain of <jats:italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</jats:italic>. However, a technology to treat or to prevent the disease infection has not been established yet, and probiont could be a potential approach for this disease. Thus, this study aimed at screening 35 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that originated from the gastrointestinal tract of wild white shrimp for the production of antivibrio compounds using an agar well diffusion. The result showed that three LAB strains (LAB-1, LAB-2, and LAB-3) showed antivibrio activity indicated by the formation of clearance zone (diameter of &gt;10mm) on the diffusion agar plate. When the extracellular products (ECP) were incubated with proteinase K, the antivibrio activity was disappeared which indicated that the antimicrobial compounds were bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). Phenotypic studies suggest that the LAB were <jats:italic>Labctobacillus</jats:italic> sp. (LAB-1 and LAB-2), and <jats:italic>Enterococcus</jats:italic> sp. (LB-3). These results suggest these LAB are potential candidates for preventing <jats:italic>V. parahaemolyticus</jats:italic>. Infection, although, further assays by <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> using live white shrimp, are still required.</jats:p>

AB  - Current food production and consumption practices are depleting natural resources and polluting ecosystems at a rate that is unsustainable and are one of the main causes of anthropogenic climate change. If this trend does not change, externalities of food production will be exacerbated in future decades due to population growth and increasing living standards. A shift towards low impact diets has been proposed as part of the solution. The public food sector offers tremendous potential for influencing such a shift; however currently in the UK this potential is only partially exploited as national guidelines for public food procurement avoid promoting the adoption of low impact menus. This doctoral research aims at addressing this shortfall by creating a procedure for the design of low impact primary school menus. This is informed by a life-cycle based tool (the Environmental Assessment Tool of School meals, EATS) that enables catering companies and local authorities to self-assess the environmental impact of a meal in terms of its carbon and water footprint, with the purpose of identifying hotspot meals and comparing alternatives in the design of new menus. The data underlying EATS includes the results of a meta-analysis of the existing literature on the carbon footprint of 110 food products commonly used in the preparation of primary school meals in the UK. To validate EATS, a statistical analysis of the underlying data was performed, feedback from its potential users was collected, three case study analyses were developed, and the results provided were compared with existing studies.

AB  - Purpose – Carp is a traditional aquaculture fish with decreasing relevance in European markets. Despite this, it is a protein source which could contribute to the worldwide protein supply. Traditional carp ponds are part of human cultural heritage with high relevance for biodiversity. But, market shares of carp are small compared to other seafood market, mainly due to low consumer demand. The aim of this research was to contribute to the discussion on how to increase demand for carp by testing the acceptance of selected preprocessed carp products.
Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative online survey was conducted in Germany and Poland with the aim of identifying consumers’ attitudes towards carp and carp products. On this basis recommendations on how to best market carp products are developed. Findings – Carp is perceived to be a fish eaten primarily at Christmas and New Year’s Eve and to be difficult to prepare. The analyses reveal that a potential for novel carp products does exist in Germany and in Poland. The
wider introduction of a bonecut filet to the market, a better availability of carp products, and the avoidance of off-flavors are important prerequisites for higher market relevance of carp. Research limitations/implications – In this research consumer preferences were elicited “theoretically” by showing pictures of carp products and asking them for their preferences. In this regard, the results
presented here state a general consumer interest and a potential for new carp products. Further research, integrating product tastings might give additional information on the likely success of new types of carp products. Practical implications – In order to let people know about the new products and at the same time to combat the sometimes existent bad image of carp, product tastings, also in combination with information regarding local origin and environmental/cultural impact, should be offered at the point of sale. Originality/value – Carp is a highly sustainable fish and offers a valuable protein source for human consumption. But, in its common ways of market presentation it is not highly appreciated by consumers. This paper demonstrates options of overcoming this situation.

AB  - Aquaponics is a food production system which connects recirculating aquaculture (fish) to hydroponics (plants) systems. Although aquaponics has the potential to improve soil conditions by reducing erosion and nutrient loss and has been shown to reduce food production related carbon emissions by up to 73%, few commercial aquaponics projects in the EU and UK have been successful. Key barriers to commercial success are insufficient initial investment, an uncertain and complex regulatory environment, and the lack of projects operating on a large scale able to demonstrate profitability. In this paper, we use the UK as a case study to discuss the legal and economic barriers to the success of commercial aquaponics in the EU. We also propose three policies: (1) making aquaponics eligible for the new system of Environmental Land Management grants; (2) making aquaponics eligible for organic certification; and (3) clarifying and streamlining the aquaponics licence application process. The UK’s departure from the EU presents a unique opportunity to review agricultural regulations and subsidies, which in turn could provide evidence that similar reforms are needed in the EU.

AB  - Aquaculture production can yield significant economic, social and environmental effects. These exceed the financial costs and benefits aquaculture producers are faced with. We propose a methodology for the development of integrated production models that allow for the inclusion of the socio-economic and environmental effects of aquaculture into the production management. The methodology develops on a Social Cost-Benefit Analysis context and it includes three parts: i) environmental, that captures the interactions of aquaculture with the environment, ii) economic, that makes provision for the incorporation of economic determinants in the production models and iii) social, that introduces the social preferences to the production and management process. Alternatives to address data availability issues are also discussed. The methodology extends the assessment of the costs and benefits of aquaculture beyond pure financial metrics and beyond the quantification of private costs and benefits. It can also support the development of integrated models of aquaculture production that take into consideration both the private and the social costs and benefits associated with externalities and effects not appropriately captured by market mechanisms. The methodology can support aquaculture management and policies targeting sustainable and efficient aquaculture production and financing from an economic, financial, social and environmental point of view.

AB  - According to the US Department of Energy, succinic acid (SA) is a top platform chemical that can be produced from biomass. Bread waste, which has high starch content, is the second most wasted food in the UK and can serve as a potential low cost feedstock for the production of SA. This work evaluates the environmental performance of a proposed biorefinery concept for SA production by fermentation of waste bread using a cradle-to-factory gate life cycle assessment approach. The performance was assessed in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and non-renewable energy use (NREU). Waste bread fermentation demonstrated a better environmental profile compared to the fossil-based system, however, GHG emissions were about 50% higher as compared to processes using other biomass feedstocks such as corn wet mill or sorghum grains. NREU for fermentative SA production using waste bread was significantly lower (~ 46%) than fossil-based system and about the same as that of established biomass-based processes, thus proving the great potential of waste bread as a valuable feedstock for bioproduction of useful chemicals. The results show that steam and heating oil used in the process were the biggest contributors to the NREU and GHG emissions. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the importance of the solid biomass waste generated in the process which can potentially be used as fish feed. The LCA analysis can be used for targeted optimization of SA production from bread waste, thereby enabling the utilization of an otherwise waste stream and leading to the establishment of a circular economy.

AB  - The Bangkok Declaration expressed the need to develop resource-efficient farming systems which make efficient use of space (water, land), seed and feed inputs by exploring the potential for the aquaculture development of species ―feeding low in the food chain‖, and fully utilizing enhancement techniques. In this review we summarize changes over the last decade since the Declaration and trends to 2050 in use of key resources for aquaculture (Table 1). Comparisons of production, water and energy efficiencies of aquaculture versus an array of fisheries and terrestrial agriculture systems shows that non-fed aquaculture (shellfish, seaweeds) is among the world’s most efficient mass producer of plant and animal proteins. Various fed aquaculture systems also match the most efficient forms of terrestrial animal husbandry, and trends suggest that carnivores in the wild have been transformed in aquaculture to omnivores with impacts on resource use comparable to conventional, terrestrial agriculture systems, but are more efficient. Production efficiencies of edible mass for a variety of aquaculture systems are 2.5-4.5 kg dry feed/kg edible mass, compared with 3.0-17.4 for a range of conventional terrestrial animal production systems. Beef cattle require over 10 kg of feed to add 1 kg of edible weight, whereas tilapia and catfish use less than 3 kg to add a kg of edible weight. Energy use in unfed and low trophic level aquaculture systems (seaweeds, mussels, carps, tilapias) is comparable to energy usages in vegetable, sheep, and rangeland beef agriculture. Highest energy use is in fish cage and shrimp aquaculture, comparable to intensive animal agriculture feedlots, and extreme energy use has been reported for some of these aquaculture systems in Thailand. Capture fisheries are energy intensive in comparison with pond aquaculture of low trophic level species. For example, to produce 1 kcal of catfish protein about 34 kcal of fossil fuel energy is required; lobster and shrimp capture fisheries use more

AB  - During the first feeding period, fish will adapt to exogenous feeding as their endogenous source of nutrients is depleted. This requires the development of a functional physiological system to control active search for food, appetite, and food intake. The Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) melanocortin system, a key player in appetite control, includes neuronal circuits expressing neuropeptide y (<i>npya</i>), agouti-related peptide (<i>agrp1</i>), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (<i>cart</i>), and proopiomelanocortin (<i>pomca</i>). Little is known about the ontogeny and function of the melanocortin system during early developmental stages. Atlantic salmon [0-730 day degrees (dd)] were reared under three different light conditions (DD, continuous darkness; LD, 14:10 Light: Dark; LL, continuous light) before the light was switched to LD and the fish fed twice a day. We examined the effects of different light conditions (DD <sub><i>LD</i></sub> , LD <sub><i>LD</i></sub> , and LL <sub><i>LD</i></sub> ) on salmon growth, yolk utilization, and periprandial responses of the neuropeptides <i>npya1, npya2, agrp1, cart2a, cart2b, cart4, pomca1</i>, and <i>pomca2</i>. Fish were collected 1 week (alevins, 830 dd, still containing yolk sac) and 3 weeks (fry, 991 dd, yolk sac fully consumed) into the first feeding period and sampled before (-1 h) and after (0.5, 1.5, 3, and 6 h) the first meal of the day. Atlantic salmon reared under DD <sub><i>LD</i></sub> , LD <sub><i>LD</i></sub> , and LL <sub><i>LD</i></sub> had similar standard lengths and myotome heights at the onset of first feeding. However, salmon kept under a constant light condition during endogenous feeding (DD <sub><i>LD</i></sub> and LL <sub><i>LD</i></sub> ) had less yolk at first feeding. At 830 dd none of the neuropeptides analyzed displayed a periprandial response. But 2 weeks later, and with no yolk remaining, significant periprandial changes were observed for <i>npya1, pomca1</i>, and <i>pomca2</i>, but only in the LD <sub><i>LD</i></sub> fish. This suggests that these key neuropeptides serve an important role in controlling feeding once Atlantic salmon need to rely entirely on active search and ingestion of exogenous food. Moreover, light conditions during early development did not affect the size of salmon at first feeding but did affect the mRNA levels of <i>npya1, pomca1</i>, and <i>pomca2</i> in the brain indicating that mimicking natural light conditions (LD <sub><i>LD</i></sub> ) better stimulates appetite control.

AB  - <jats:p>The rapid development and intensive production of aquaculture have brought to light various environmental problems. In particular, fish farming adversely affects the benthic environments through the accumulation of organic matter (OM), which leads to the degradation of aquatic sediments and associated biotic communities. To prevent environmental degradation, proper site selection for fish farming is a prerequisite for sustainable aquaculture practices. An important physical factor in selecting a site for fish farming is sediment structure. Coarser sediments are preferred, while their mineral composition is rarely discussed. To investigate relationships between sediment characteristics and the content of OM, sediments were collected from three different sites with different aquaculture practices under different climatic and environmental conditions and analyzed during the one-year monitoring period. Grain size distribution, mineral composition, carbonate content, and organic matter content were determined for three fish farm sites (Ilova, River, Krka River, and Pelješac) and their reference sites. Preliminary results from all studied sites showed that sediment texture in combination with natural mineral composition is one of the key factors for the accumulation of OM in the sediment. In particular, the mineral composition of the fine-grained sediment should be known when conducting an environmental impact assessment of fish farms.</jats:p>

AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is an endangered freshwater species that needs help to recover its wild stocks. However, the priority in aquaculture is to obtain successful fertilisation and genetic variability to secure the revival of the species. The aims of the present work were to study sperm subpopulation structure and motility patterns in wild anadromous males and farmed male Atlantic salmon parr. Salmon sperm samples were collected from wild anadromous salmon (WS) and two generations of farmed parr males. Sperm samples were collected from sexually mature males and sperm motility was analysed at different times after activation (5 and 35s). Differences among the three groups were analysed using statistical techniques based on Cluster analysis the Bayesian method. Atlantic salmon were found to have three sperm subpopulations, and the spermatozoa in ejaculates of mature farmed parr males had a higher velocity and larger size than those of WS males. This could be an adaptation to high sperm competition because salmonid species are naturally adapted to this process. Motility analysis enables us to identify sperm subpopulations, and it may be useful to correlate these sperm subpopulations with fertilisation ability to test whether faster-swimming spermatozoa have a higher probability of success.

AB  - Intensive salmonid cage culture releases nutrients and organic matter that lead eutrophication of coastal waters. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is receiving great attention as a means of reducing organic/inorganic nutrient loads to the environment and increasing productivity by rearing viable secondary organisms. In this study blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) were cultured close to a salmon (Salmo salar) cage farm at Tristen, Bjugn in Sor Trondelag, Central Norway from June 2010 to February 2011. 3 experimental stations at the fish farming area and 2 reference stations (1.8 and 3.6 km away from the fish farm, respectively) were positioned to test if the integrated mussel culture reduces the environmental impact from salmon cage culture. Highest water temperature recorded was 14.3 °C in July. Water temperature was above 10 °C until middle of October and the lowest was 3.1 °C in winter. Total particulate matter (TPM) and chlorophyll a contents varied 6.3  10.5 mg L-1 and 0.1 - 2.5 µg L-1, respectively. The mussel (n=450) length increased from 31.1±0.04 mm (standard length±SE) to 41.5±0.17 mm. The mussel growth was high in summer (June  September) and was close to zero in the winter (October  February). Multiple regression analysis showed that water temperature was the prime factor affecting condition index (CI) (meat dry weight/shell dry weight) and specific growth rate (SGR) of mussel. No differences were found in the environmental variables and food availabilities among the stations. Significantly higher CIs at the experimental stations (station 1, 2 and 3) than at the reference stations were caused by utilization of fish farm discharges by the mussels. Fatty acids 18:1 (n-9), 18:2 (n-6) and 20:5 (n-3) signatures and the ratio of n-3 to n-6 in the digestive gland tissue of mussels collected in February support the findings. SGR in shell length was highest at reference station 5 (0.29 % day-1 in summer and 0.02 % day-1 in winter). This result might be caused by slow current speed at the station. It is concluded that, mussels may play an important role reducing environmental impact from salmon farm and it gives a possibility to integrating mussels on the salmon cage culture.

AB  - Parasitic salmon lice are potentially harmful to salmonid hosts and farm produced lice pose a threat to wild salmonids. To control salmon lice infections in Norwegian salmonid farming, numbers of lice are regularly counted and lice abundance is reported from all salmonid farms every month. We have developed a stochastic space-time model where monthly lice abundance is modelled simultaneously for all farms. The set of farms is regarded as a network where the degree of contact between farms depends on their seaway distance. The expected lice abundance at each farm is modelled as a function of i) lice abundance in previous months at the same farm, ii) at neighbourhood farms, and iii) other, unspecified sources. In addition, the model includes explanatory variables such as seawater temperature and farm-numbers of fish. The model gives insight into factors that affect salmon lice abundance and contributing sources of infection. New findings in this study were that 66% of the expected salmon lice abundance was attributed to infection within farms, 28% was attributed to infection from neighbourhood farms and 6% to non-specified sources of infection. Furthermore, we present the relative risk of infection between neighbourhood farms as a function of seaway distance, which can be viewed as a between farm transmission kernel for salmon lice. The present modelling framework lays the foundation for development of future scenario simulation tools for examining the spread and abundance of salmon lice on farmed salmonids under different control regimes.

AB  - <b>Background:</b> Worldwide, aquaculture is considered as a hotspot environment for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to the intense use of antibiotics in its productive systems. Chile is the second largest producer of farmed salmon worldwide, and tons of antibiotics are used to control bacterial diseases, such as Salmon Rickettsial Syndrome (SRS) and Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD). However, studies determining the risk of consuming salmon fillets that have been treated with antibiotics during the salmon production are limited. Consulting leading experts in the field could provide a knowledge base to identify and address this question and research gaps. <b>Methods:</b> Multisectoral risk perception of AMR through salmon fillet consumption was evaluated by eliciting expert data obtained through discussions during a workshop and from questionnaires given to experts from academia (n = 15, 63%), the public sector (n = 5, 21%), and the salmon industry (n = 4, 17%). <b>Results:</b> The qualitative risk analysis suggested an overall 'low' probability of AMR acquisition by consumption of salmon fillet that had been treated during the production cycle. The risk perception varied slightly between production stages in freshwater and seawater. In consensus with all sectors, this overall 'low', but existing, risk was probably associated with bacterial infections and the use of antibiotics. <b>Conclusions:</b> As it is essential to reduce the use of antibiotics in the Chilean salmon industry, this intersectoral approach and consensual results could favor effective implementation of targeted initiatives for the control and prevention of major bacterial diseases.

AB  - Cultured Atlantic salmon Salmo salar are of international socioeconomic value, and the process of domestication has resulted in significant behavioural, morphological, and allelic differences from wild populations. Substantial evidence indicates that direct genetic interactions or interbreeding between wild and escaped farmed Atlantic salmon occurs, genetically altering wild salmon and reducing population viability. However, genetic interactions may also occur through ecological mechanisms (e.g. disease, parasites, predation, competition), both in conjunction with and in the absence of interbreeding. Here we examine existing evidence for ecological and non-reproductive genetic interactions between domestic Atlantic salmon and wild populations and the potential use of genetic and genomic tools to resolve these impacts. Our review identified examples of genetic changes resulting from ecological processes, predominately through pathogen or parasite transmission. In addition, many examples were identified where aquaculture activities have either altered the selective landscape experienced by wild populations or resulted in reductions in population abundance, both of which are consistent with the widespread occurrence of indirect genetic changes. We further identify opportunities for genetic or genomic methods to quantify these impacts, though careful experimental design and pre-impact comparisons are often needed to accurately attribute genetic change to aquaculture activities. Our review indicates that ecological and non-reproductive genetic interactions are important, and further study is urgently needed to support an integrated understanding of aquaculture-ecosystem interactions, their implications for ecosystem stability, and the development of potential mitigation and management strategies.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that marine algae represent a great source of natural compounds with several properties. The lipidic extract of the seaweed Chaetomorpha linum (Chlorophyta, Cladophorales), one of the dominant species in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Mediterranean, Ionian Sea), revealed an antibacterial activity against Vibrio ordalii and Vibrio vulnificus, common pathogens in aquaculture, suggesting its potential employment to control fish and shellfish diseases due to vibriosis and to reduce the public health hazards related to antibiotic use in aquaculture. This extract showed also an antioxidant activity, corresponding to 170.960 ± 16. mmol Trolox equivalent/g (oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay—ORAC) and to 30.554 ± 2.30 mmol Trolox equivalent/g (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay—TEAC). The chemical characterization of the extract, performed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, highlighted the presence of free, saturated (SAFAs), unsaturated (UFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. The high content of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs confirmed also by gas chromatography indicates the potentiality of this algal species in the production of fortified food. The antibacterial activity seems related to the presence of linolenic acid present at high density, while the antioxidant activity could be likely ascribable to molecules such as carotenoids and chlorophylls (characterized also by thin-layer chromatography), known for this property. The presence of polyhydroxybutyrate, a biopolymer with potentiality in the field of biodegradable bioplastics was also detected. The exploitation of C. linum for a future biotechnological application is also encouraged by the results from a first attempt of cultivating this species in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system.

AB  - Eco-certification is widely considered a tool for reducing environmental impacts of aquaculture, but what are the likely environmental outcomes for the world's fastest growing animal-food production sector? This article analyzes a number of eco-certification schemes based on species choice, anticipated share of the global seafood market, size of eligible producers, and targeted environmental impacts. The potential of eco-certification to reduce the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture at scale presently appears uncertain as: (a) certification schemes currently focus on species predominantly consumed in the EU and US, with limited coverage of Asian markets; (b) the share of certified products in the market as currently projected is too low; (c) there is an inequitable and non-uniform applicability of certification across the sector; (d) mechanisms or incentives for improvement among the worst performers are lacking; and (e) there is incomplete coverage of environmental impacts, with biophysical sustainability and ecosystem perspectives generally lacking.

AB  - <i>Artemisia ordosica</i> has been applied as a traditional Chinese/Mongolian medicine for the treatment of certain inflammatory ailments. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of <i>Artemisia ordosica</i> total flavonoids (ATF) supplemented in diets on growth performance, oxidative stress, and antioxidant status in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged broilers. A total of 240 one-day-old Arbor Acre broilers were randomly allotted into 5 groups with 6 replicates (<i>n</i> = 8), which were the basal diet group (CON), LPS-challenged and basal diet group (LPS), and the LPS-challenged and basal diet added with low (500 mg/kg), middle (750 mg/kg), and high (1000 mg/kg) doses of ATF groups (ATF-L, ATF-M, and ATF-H), respectively. On day 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28, broilers were injected intra-abdominally either with LPS or an equivalent amount of saline. Results showed that dietary ATF alleviated the LPS-induced decrease in BW, ADG, and ADFI in broilers. Dietary ATF supplementation reversed the increased serum oxidative damage indexes (reactive oxygen species, protein carbonyl, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine) and the decreased serum antioxidant indexes [total superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)] in LPS-challenged broilers. Moreover, ATF alleviated the decreased antioxidase activity and the over-production of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and spleen induced by LPS. This study also showed that ATF alleviated the increased mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (<i>Keap1</i>) and the decreased mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (<i>Nrf2</i>), <i>CAT</i>, <i>SOD</i>, and <i>GPx</i> in the liver and spleen of broilers challenged with LPS. In conclusion, ATF has a strong capacity to enhance antioxidant enzyme activity and relieve oxidative stress and can be used as a potential novel feed additive in poultry diets to improve growth performance and antioxidant capacity.

AB  - In Vietnam, fishing is a crucial source of nutrition and employment, which not only affects the development of the domestic economy but is also closely related to exports, heavily influencing the economy and foreign exchange. However, the Vietnamese fishery sector has been facing many challenges in innovating production technology, improving product quality, and expanding markets. Hence, the fishery enterprises need to find solutions to increase labor productivity and enhance competitiveness while minimizing difficulties. This study implemented a performance evaluation from 2015 to 2018 of 17 fishery businesses, in decision making units (DMUs), in Vietnam by applying data envelopment analysis, namely the Malmquist model. The objective of the paper is to provide a general overview of the fishery sector in Vietnam through technical efficiency, technological progress, and the total factor productivity in the four-year period. The variables used in the model include total assets, equity, total liabilities, cost of sales, revenue, and profit. The results of the paper show that Investment Commerce Fisheries Corporation (DMU10) and Hoang Long Group (DMU8) exhibited the best performances. This paper offers a valuable reference to improve the business efficiency of Vietnamese fishery enterprises and could be a useful reference for related industries.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA) is a strategy for the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector, but the question of how it can be practically implemented remains unclear. Indicators that can be applied at relevant scales of impact and that reflect the environmental status and change offer a means of operationalizing EAA. Therefore, a systematic literature review was carried out to identify environmental indicators referenced in salmon aquaculture literature and review their potential to support EAA. Using the PRISMA method for selecting journal papers, 101 articles that included 531 indicators were reviewed. Indicators were characterized based on the effect of aquaculture they measure, their similarity to other indicators extracted, and the scale at which they were applied. Indicators and their characteristics are presented in a searchable online database. A scoring method for evaluating indicators based on criteria drawn from environmental indicator literature and the potential scalability of indicators to meet the needs of EAA was developed and applied to the most frequently referenced indicators. Overall, near‐field indicators of benthic impacts dominated salmon aquaculture literature. Of the most frequently referenced indicators, those that scored highest based on criteria drawn from environmental indicator literature also scored highest on scalability and therefore their potential contribution to EAA. Overall, results suggest that additional research and application of far‐field environmental indicators in salmon aquaculture will be required to identify a suite of indicators that can be applied as part of EAA practice.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract A protein gap exists within the supply of fish feed ingredients due to intensifying global aquaculture production and demands. This is distinctly acute in salmonid farming where protein requirements are higher to other aquatic farmed species. In pursuit of a viable alternative, an eight-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of including reared black soldier fly (BSF, Hermetia illucens) larvae into rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) diets. Five diets were formulated: a fish meal-based basal diet (CTRL), two diets of BSF incorporation at 15 and 30% (BSF15; BSF30), and two diets at the same incorporation level with the addition of a supplementary protease enzyme (BSF15P; BSF30P) assigned to test potential dietary enhancement. No significant growth performance between the dietary treatments was observed. The fish condition factor in BSF30 was higher than BSF30P (P = 0.025). Fillets showed increased muscle yellowness as dietary BSF increased (P = 0.004). Trout fed BSF displayed significantly lower lipid peroxidation post-harvest (P

AB  - <jats:p> Diadromous fish populations have incurred precipitous declines across the globe. Among many stressors, these species are threatened by anthropogenic barriers that impede movement, alter riverine habitat, and augment predator communities. In this study, we used acoustic transmitters ( n = 220) with predation and temperature sensors to characterize Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar) smolt predation risk in the Penobscot River, Maine, USA. Across two seasons, we documented 79 predation events through a 170 km migratory pathway, which included three hydropower projects and a large estuary. We detected tagged smolts that were predated by fish ( n = 42), marine mammals ( n = 28), and birds ( n = 9). Using a multistate mark-recapture framework, we estimated that 46% of smolts were predated during downstream migration, which accounted for at least 55% of all mortality. Relative predation risk was greatest through impoundments and the lower estuary, where on average, predation rates were 4.8-fold and 9.0-fold greater than free-flowing reaches, respectively. These results suggest that predation pressure on Atlantic salmon smolts is exacerbated by hydropower projects and that predation in the lower estuary may be greater than expected. </jats:p>

AB  - ABSTRACTManaging and regulating aquaculture is a complicated issue. From the perspective of fish farmers as well as regulators managing aquaculture can be regarded as what political scientists refer to as a “wicked problem.” This is because there is a great extent of uncertainty and lack of firm knowledge with respect to the externalities of aquaculture production; e.g., diseases, environmental impacts, and conflicts with other user interests. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the aquaculture sector contributes to the uncertainty as new solutions emerge, rendering established knowledge obsolete or irrelevant. Designing appropriate public regulations and policy measures is thus important, but difficult. Based on empirical data from Norway, we investigate what respondents from public agencies and the industry perceive to be challenges in governing aquaculture and what we may infer on the characteristics of a good governance approach. We propose that such an approach needs to focus on building competence, c...

AB  - In this study, the approaches of employees in marine fish hatcheries to occupational health and safety were determined. Cronbach's <i>α</i> coefficient was calculated as 0.858 in the reliability of the scale and scale factors based on internal consistency. In addition,factor analysis according to the varimax method was found to be approximately 64%. It was determined that 68% of the employees were not aware of the relevant laws. In addition,85% of the employees are aware of the dangers and risks in their workplaces. In the event of a negative situation in the workplace,the rate of those who know their legal rights is 73% (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). In addition,91% of the employees stated that they would use their right to object in a risky situation and quit the job. Sixty per cent of the employees stated that their jobs can satisfy them sociologically and economically throughout their life.

AB  - Compensatory growth (CG) is a means by which organisms can increase their growth rate above their routine growth rate after a period of environmentally induced growth depression. Despite a focus on the implications of CG for aquaculture, little research has evaluated the effect of domesticated–wild hybridization on CG. Any deviation in the mean compensatory ability of hybrids relative to their wild progenitors, or any notable costs to compensation in terms of body morphology, could affect the ability of hybrids to persist in changing environments. We compared CG of farmed, wild and hybrid (F1, F2, wild backcross) juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Wild salmon experienced both lower routine and CG rates relative to farmed salmon, while hybrids were intermediate. However, the compensatory responses (slopes of the reaction norms) for each cross were parallel, indicating that hybridization did not affect the CG response itself. Morphological costs to compensation were not detected. In addition to contributing to risk assessments of the consequences of interbreeding between wild and escaped domesticated organisms, we conclude that plasticity studies on domesticated–wild hybrids and their progenitors are useful for testing basic predictions about the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, as well as understanding the evolutionary significance of hybrids.

AB  - Abstract Life cycle assessment (LCA), a tool used to assess the environmental impacts of products and processes, has been used to evaluate a range of aquaculture systems. Eighteen LCA studies were reviewed which included assessments of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), flow-through systems, net cages, and pond systems. This review considered the potential to mitigate environmental burdens with a movement from extensive to intensive aquaculture systems. Due to the diversity in study results, specific processes (feed, energy, and infrastructure) and specific impact categories (land use, water use, and eutrophication potential) were analyzed in-depth. The comparative analysis indicated there was a possible shift from local to global impacts with a progression from extensive to intensive systems, if mitigation strategies were not performed. The shift was partially due to increased electricity requirements but also varied with electricity source. The impacts from infrastructure were less than 13 % of the environmental impact and considered negligible. For feed, the environmental impacts were typically more dependent on feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the type of system. Feed also contributed to over 50 % of the impacts on land use, second only to energy carriers. The analysis of water use indicated intensive recirculating systems efficiently reduce water use as compared to extensive systems; however, at present, studies have only considered direct water use and future work is required that incorporates indirect and consumptive water use. Alternative aquaculture systems that can improve the total nutrient uptake and production yield per material and energy based input, thereby reducing the overall emissions per unit of feed, should be further investigated to optimize the overall of aquaculture systems, considering both global and local environmental impacts. While LCA can be a valuable tool to evaluate trade-offs in system designs, the results are often location and species specific. Therefore, it is critical to consider both of these criteria in conjunction with LCA results when developing aquaculture systems.

AB  - The United States today imports most of the seafood it consumes. Half of these imports are from aquaculture. Domestic wild capture production is limited and U.S. aquaculture production has declined in recent years. Policy, socioeconomic, and regulatory obstacles stand in the way of expanded U.S. aquaculture production. In this article, we examine the implications of two future paths for seafood supply: an increasing reliance on imports, and a shift toward increased domestic aquaculture production. We examine global trends, likely future developments in U.S. seafood demand and supply, and implications of the path of U.S. aquaculture development for U.S. seafood supply and prices, employment, ecological footprint, and seafood supply security and safety. We conclude with recommendations for a path forward that serves the interests of the nation and the global community in the search for economically sound and sustainable ways to feed a growing population.

AB  - Smoltification and early seawater phase are critical developmental periods with physiological and biochemical changes in Atlantic salmon that facilitates survival in saltwater. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to have important roles in development, but whether any miRNAs are involved in regulation of gene expression during smoltification and the adaption to seawater is largely unknown. Here, small RNA sequencing of materials from head kidney before, during smoltification and post seawater transfer were used to study expression dynamics of miRNAs, while microarray analysis was applied to study mRNA expression dynamics. Comparing all timepoints, 71 miRNAs and 2709 mRNAs were identified as differentially expressed (DE). Hierarchical clustering analysis of the DE miRNAs showed three major clusters with characteristic expression changes. Eighty-one DE mRNAs revealed negatively correlated expression patterns to DE miRNAs in Cluster I and III. Furthermore, 42 of these mRNAs were predicted as DE miRNA targets. Gene enrichment analysis of negatively correlated target genes showed they were enriched in gene ontology groups hormone biosynthesis, stress management, immune response, and ion transport. The results strongly indicate that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs is important in smoltification and sea water adaption, and this study identifies several putative miRNA-target pairs for further functional studies.

AB  - Abstract Neutrophils release chromatin extracellular traps (ETs) as part of the fish innate immune response to counter the threats posed by microbial pathogens. However, relatively little attention has been paid to this phenomenon in many commercially farmed species, despite the importance of understanding host-pathogen interactions and the potential to influence ET release to reduce disease outbreaks. The aim of this present study was to investigate the release of ETs by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) immune cells. Extracellular structures resembling ETs of different morphology were observed by fluorescence microscopy in neutrophil suspensions in vitro, as these structures stained positively with Sytox Green and were digestible with DNase I. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the ET structures to be decorated with histones H1 and H2A and neutrophil elastase, which are characteristic for ETs in mammals and other organisms. Although the ETs were released spontaneously, release in neutrophil suspensions was stimulated most significantly with 5 μg/ml calcium ionophore (CaI) for 1 h, whilst the fish pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida (isolates 30411 and Hooke) also exerted a stimulatory effect. Microscopic observations revealed bacteria in association with ETs, and fewer bacterial colonies of A. salmonicida Hooke were recovered at 3 h after co-incubation with neutrophils that had been induced to release ETs. Interestingly, spontaneous release of ETs was inversely associated with fish mass (p

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector worldwide, mostly driven by a steadily increasing protein demand. In response to growing ecological concerns, life cycle assessment (LCA) emerged as a key environmental tool to measure the impacts of various production systems, including aquaculture. In this review, we focused on farmed salmonids to perform an in-depth analysis, investigating methodologies and comparing results of LCA studies of this finfish family in relation to species and production technologies. Identifying the environmental strengths and weaknesses of salmonid production technologies is central to ensure that industrial actors and policymakers make informed choices to take the production of this important marine livestock to a more sustainable path. Three critical aspects of salmonid LCAs were studied based on 24 articles and reports: (1) Methodological application, (2) construction of inventories, and (3) comparison of production technologies across studies. Our first assessment provides an overview and compares important methodological choices. The second analysis maps the main foreground and background data sources, as well as the state of process inclusion and exclusion. In the third section, a first attempt to compare life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) data across production technologies was conducted using a single factor statistical protocol. Overall, findings suggested a lack of methodological completeness and reporting in the literature and demonstrated that inventories suffered from incomplete description and partial disclosure. Our attempt to compare LCA results across studies was challenging due to confounding factors and poor data availability, but useful as a first step in highlighting the importance of production technology for salmonids. In groups where the data was robust enough for statistical comparison, both differences and mean equalities were identified, allowing ranking of technology clusters based on their average scores. We statistically demonstrated that sea-based systems outperform land-based technology in terms of energy demand and that sea-based systems have a generally higher FCR than land-based ones. Cross-study analytics also strongly suggest that open systems generate on average more eutrophying emissions than closed designs. We further discuss how to overcome bottlenecks currently hampering such LCA meta-analysis. Arguments are made in favor of further developing cross-study LCA analysis, particularly by increasing the number of salmonid LCA available (to improve sample sizes) and by reforming in-depth LCA practices to enable full reproducibility and greater access to inventory data.

AB  - When an organism makes a long-distance transition to a new habitat, the associated environmental change is often marked and requires physiological plasticity of larvae, juveniles, or other migrant stages. Exposing shallow-water marine bivalves (<i>Aequiyoldia cf. eightsii</i>) from southern South America (SSA) and the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) to changes in temperature and oxygen availability, we investigated changes in gene expression in a simulated colonization experiment of the shores of a new continent after crossing of the Drake Passage, and in a warming scenario in the WAP. Bivalves from SSA were cooled from 7°C (<i>in situ</i>) to 4°C and 2°C (future warmed WAP conditions), WAP bivalves were warmed from 1.5°C (current summer <i>in situ</i>) to 4°C (warmed WAP), gene expression patterns in response to thermal stress by itself and in combination with hypoxia were measured after 10 days. Our results confirm that molecular plasticity may play a vital role for local adaptation. Hypoxia had a greater effect on the transcriptome than temperature alone. The effect was further amplified when hypoxia and temperature acted as combined stressors. The WAP bivalves showed a remarkable ability to cope with short-term exposure to hypoxia by switching to a metabolic rate depression strategy and activating the alternative oxidation pathway, whilst the SSA population showed no comparable response. In SSA, the high prevalence of apoptosis-related differentially expressed genes especially under combined higher temperatures and hypoxia indicated that the SSA <i>Aequiyoldia</i> are operating near their physiological limits already. While the effect of temperature <i>per se</i> may not represent the single most effective barrier to Antarctic colonization by South American bivalves, the current distribution patterns as well as their resilience to future conditions can be better understood by looking at the synergistic effects of temperature in conjunction with short-term exposure to hypoxia.

AB  - Food production is a major driver of global environmental change and the overshoot of planetary sustainability boundaries. Greater affluence in developing nations and human population growth are also increasing demand for all foods, and for animal proteins in particular. Consequently, a growing body of literature calls for the sustainable intensification of food production, broadly defined as “producing more using less”. Most assessments of the potential for sustainable intensification rely on only one or two indicators, meaning that ecological trade-offs among impact categories that occur as production intensifies may remain unaccounted for. The present study addresses this limitation using life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify six local and global environmental consequences of intensifying aquaculture production in Bangladesh. Production data are from a unique survey of 2,678 farms, and results show multidirectional associations between the intensification of aquaculture production and its environmental impacts. Intensification (measured in material and economic output per unit primary area farmed) is positively correlated with acidification, eutrophication, and ecotoxicological impacts in aquatic ecosystems; negatively correlated with freshwater consumption; and indifferent with regard to global warming and land occupation. As production intensifies, the geographical locations of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, acidifying emissions, freshwater consumption, and land occupation shift from the immediate vicinity of the farm to more geographically dispersed telecoupled locations across the globe. Simple changes in fish farming technology and management practices that could help make the global transition to more intensive forms of aquaculture be more sustainable are identified.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Exercise training may be an effective tool for promoting growth and production efficiency in finfish aquaculture. Yet, changes in growth and feed conversion ratios (FCR) following periods of exercise can be varied and context dependent. Variation in species and training protocols (duration, intensity and regime) can misalign interpretations, and individual studies hold limited statistical power. To remedy this, we compiled data from 69 studies spanning 31 species to quantify the effects of exercise training on growth rates and FCRs. Using meta‐analytic tools, we show that exercise training significantly increases growth rates across a range of taxonomically diverse finfish. Optimal training regimes were identified; effects were strongest when fish were exercised continuously rather than intermittently, at target swimming speeds ≤ 2 body lengths s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, for longer durations of time. These results are most applicable to juvenile fish (mean length of fish in the analyses = 16 cm). Exercise training was also shown to decrease variability in growth rates, leading to fish that are more uniform in size. FCRs were unaffected by exercise, showing that exercised‐ and control‐fish were equally efficient at converting food into body mass. Overall, our analyses show that exercise is a powerful management tool in promoting rapid growth, where fish can reach marketable sizes faster.</jats:p>

AB  - In this paper, we present updated data on proximate composition, amino acid, and fatty acid composition, as well as concentrations of dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and selected heavy metals, in fillets from farmed (n = 20), escaped (n = 17), and wild (n = 23) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The concentrations of dioxins (0.53 ± 0.12 pg toxic equivalents (TEQ)/g), dioxin-like PCBs (0.95 ± 0.48 pg TEQ/g), mercury (56.3 ± 12.9 µg/kg) and arsenic (2.56 ± 0.87 mg/kg) were three times higher in wild compared to farmed salmon, but all well below EU-uniform maximum levels for contaminants in food. The six ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) PCBs concentrations (5.09 ± 0.83 ng/g) in wild salmon were higher than in the farmed fish (3.34 ± 0.46 ng/g). The protein content was slightly higher in wild salmon (16%) compared to the farmed fish (15%), and the amount of essential amino acids were similar. The fat content of farmed salmon (18%) was three times that of the wild fish, and the proportion of marine long-chain omega-3 fatty acids was a substantially lower (8.9 vs. 24.1%). The omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio was higher in farmed than wild salmon (0.7 vs. 0.05). Both farmed and wild Atlantic salmon are still valuable sources of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. One 150 g portion per week will contribute to more (2.1 g and 1.8 g) than the recommended weekly intake for adults.

AB  - Piscirickettsia salmonis, the etiological agent of Piscirickettsiosis, is a Gram-negative and facultative intracellular pathogen that has affected the Chilean salmon industry since 1989. The bacterium is highly aggressive and can survive and replicate within fish macrophages using the Dot/Icm secretion system to evade the host's immune response and spread systemically. To date, no efficient control measures have been developed for this disease; therefore, the producers use large amounts of antibiotics to control this pathogen. In this frame, this work has focused on evaluating the use of saponins from Quillaja saponaria as a new alternative to control the Piscirickettsiosis. It has been previously reported that purified extract of Q. saponaria (PQSE) displays both antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and viruses and adjuvant properties. Our results show that PQSE does not present antimicrobial activity against P. salmonis, although it reduces P. salmonis infection in an in vitro model, promoting the phagosome-lysosome fusion. Additionally, we demonstrate that PQSE modulates the expression of IL-12 and IL-10 in infected cells, promoting the immune response against the pathogen and reducing the expression of pathogen virulence genes. These results together strongly argue for specific anti-invasion and anti-intracellular replication effects induced by the PQSE in macrophages.

AB  - In salmonid aquaculture, a variety of technologies have been deployed that attempt to limit a range of environmental impacts associated with net-pen culture. One such technology employs a floating, solid-walled enclosure as the primary culture environment, providing greater potential control over negative interactions with surroundings waters while limiting energy use required for water circulation, thermo-regulation and supplemental oxygen provision. Here, we utilize life cycle assessment to model contributions to a suite of global-scale resource depletion and environmental concerns (including global warming potential, acidification potential, marine eutrophication potential, cumulative energy use, and biotic resource use) of such a technology deployed commercially to rear Chinook salmon in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Results indicate that at full grow-out, feed provisioning and on-site energy use dominate contributions across four of five impact categories assessed. For example, per tonne of salmo...

AB  - Aquaculture is seen as an essential requirement for improving food security and nutrition. Fish such as salmonids are a primary source of protein and essential nutrients. Aquaculture provide income for communities across the world and have a smaller carbon footprint than terrestrial animal-production systems. However, fish diseases are a constant threat, and the use of antibiotics is a source of concern due to its adverse impacts on the environment and human health. Chilean salmon farming has made several efforts to reduce the use of antibiotics for the eradication of piscirickettsiosis, a disease caused by the gram-negative bacteria Piscirickettsia salmonis. Excessive amounts of antibiotics continue to be used in Chilean aquaculture, playing an important role in the emerging public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance. Without doubt, P. salmonis is becoming increasingly resistant to important frontline antimicrobial classes, with severe implications for the future treatment of infectious human and animal diseases. Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria as well as antibiotic residues from salmon production are spreading in the environment, and thus both salmon food commodities and wild organisms can become a source of resistant bacteria that can be transmitted to humans as foodborne contaminants. This urgent threat needs to be addressed by implementing national strategies in compliance with international standards that include both prudent antimicrobial use in marine salmon farms and the investment towards a One Health approach, which combines human, animal and environmental health.

AB  - Sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA-seq) is an emergent new monitoring tool that promises to facilitate the accurate and cost effective detection of species in environmental samples. eDNA monitoring is likely to have a major impact on the ability of salmonid aquaculture industry producers and their regulators to detect the presence and abundance of pathogens and other biological threats in the surrounding environment. However, for eDNA-seq to develop into a useful bio-monitoring tool it is necessary to (a) validate that sequence datasets derived from amplification of meta-barcoding markers reflect the true species identity and abundances in biological samples, and (b) establish a low-cost sequencing method to enable the bulk processing of environmental samples. In this study, we employed an elaborate experimental design whereby different combinations of five biological agents were crossed at three abundance levels and exposed to pre-filtered and normal seawater, prior to coarse filtering and then eDNA ultrafiltration of the resultant material. We then benchmarked the low-cost, scalable, Ion Torrent sequencing method against the current gold-standard Illumina platform for eDNAseq detection in aquaculture. Based on amplicon-seq of the 18S SSU rDNA v9 region, we found that Illumina and Ion Torrent were equally good in identifying the two parasite species (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Paramoeba perurans), whereas the microalgae species Prymnesium parvum, Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries and P. delicatissima could be assigned correctly only to the genus level. Illumina and Ion Torrent were also equally able to reflect community composition in our samples, whereas Ion Torrent was more sensitive in detecting species richness when the medium was unfiltered seawater. Both methods were able to reflect the correct abundances of 4 out of 5 species in samples from unfiltered seawater, despite the significant amount of background noise from both bacteria and eukaryotes. Our findings indicate that eDNA-seq offers significant potential in the monitoring of species harmful to aquaculture and for this purpose, the low-cost Ion Torrent sequencing is equally as accurate as Illumina.

AB  - Early marine survival of juvenile salmon is intimately associated with their physiological condition during smoltification and ocean entry. Smoltification (parr-smolt transformation) is a developmental process that allows salmon to acquire seawater tolerance in preparation for marine living. Traditionally, this developmental process has been monitored using gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity or plasma hormones, but gill gene expression offers the possibility of another method. Here, we describe the discovery of candidate genes from gill tissue for staging smoltification using comparisons of microarray studies with particular focus on the commonalities between anadromous Rainbow trout and Sockeye salmon datasets, as well as a literature comparison encompassing more species. A subset of 37 candidate genes mainly from the microarray analyses was used for TaqMan quantitative PCR assay design and their expression patterns were validated using gill samples from four groups, representing three species and two ecotypes: Coho salmon, Sockeye salmon, stream-type Chinook salmon and ocean-type Chinook salmon. The best smoltification biomarkers, as measured by consistent changes across these four groups, were genes involved in ion regulation, oxygen transport and immunity. Smoltification gene expression patterns (using the top 10 biomarkers) were confirmed by significant correlations with NKA activity and were associated with changes in body brightness, caudal fin darkness and caudal peduncle length. We incorporate gene expression patterns of pre-smolt, smolt and de-smolt trials from acute seawater transfers from a companion study to develop a preliminary seawater tolerance classification model for ocean-type Chinook salmon. This work demonstrates the potential of gene expression biomarkers to stage smoltification and classify juveniles as pre-smolt, smolt or de-smolt.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a relatively new monitoring tool featuring in an increasing number of applications such as the facilitation of the accurate and cost effective detection of species in environmental samples. eDNA monitoring is likely to have a major impact on the ability of salmonid aquaculture industry producers and their regulators to detect the presence and abundance of pathogens and other biological threats in the surrounding environment. However, for eDNA metabarcoding to develop into a useful bio-monitoring tool it is necessary to (a) validate that sequence datasets derived from amplification of metabarcoding markers reflect the true species' identity, (b) test the sensitivity under different abundance levels and environmental noise and (c) establish a low-cost sequencing method to enable the bulk processing of field samples. In this study, we employed an elaborate experimental design whereby different combinations of five biological agents were crossed at three abundance levels and exposed to sterile pre-filtered and unfiltered seawater, prior to coarse filtering and then eDNA ultrafiltration of the resultant material. We then benchmarked the low-cost, scalable, Ion Torrent sequencing method against the current gold-standard Illumina platform for eDNA surveys in aquaculture. Based on amplicon-seq of the 18S SSU rDNA v9 region, we were able to identify two parasites (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Paramoeba perurans) to species level, whereas the microalgae species Prymnesium parvum, Pseudo-nitzschia seriata, and P. delicatissima could be assigned correctly only to the genus level. Illumina and Ion Torrent provided near identical results in terms of community composition in our samples, whereas Ion Torrent was more sensitive in detecting species richness when the medium was unfiltered seawater. Both methods were able to reflect the difference in relative abundance between treatments in 4 out of 5 species when samples were exposed to the unfiltered seawater, despite the significant amount of background noise from both bacteria and eukaryotes. Our findings indicate that eDNA metabarcoding offers significant potential in the monitoring of species harmful to aquaculture and for this purpose, the low-cost Ion Torrent sequencing is as accurate as Illumina in determining differences in their relative abundance between samples.

AB  - Climate-driven changes in aquatic environments have already started to affect the
European aquaculture sector’s most commercially important finfish and shellfish
species. In addition to changes in water quality and temperature that can directly
influence fish production by altering health status, growth performance and/or feed
conversion, the aquaculture sector also faces an uncertain future in terms of production costs and returns. For example, the availability of key ingredients for fish feeds (proteins, omega-3 fatty acids) will not only depend on future changes in climate, but also on social and political factors, thereby influencing feed costs. The future cost of energy, another main expenditure for fish farms, will also depend on various factors. Finally, marketing options and subsidies will have major impacts on future aquaculture profitability. Based on the framework of four socio-political scenarios developed in the EU H2020 project climate change and European aquatic resources (CERES), we defined how these key factors for the aquaculture sector could change in the future. We then apply these scenarios to make projections of how climate change and societal and economic trends influence the mid-century (2050) profitability of European aquaculture. We used an established benchmarking approach to contrast present-day and future economic performance of “typical farms” in selected European production regions under each of the scenarios termed “World Markets,” “National Enterprise,” “Global Sustainability” and “Local Stewardship.” These scenarios were based partly on the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios framework and their representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and the widely used shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Together, these scenarios contrast local versus international emphasis on decision making, more versus less severe environmental change, and different consequences for producers due to future commodity prices, cash returns, and costs. The mid-century profitability of the typical farms was most sensitive to the future development of feed costs, price trends of returns, and marketing options as opposed to the direct effect of climate-driven changes in the environment. These results can inform adaptation planning by the European aquaculture sector. Moreover, applying consistent scenarios including societal and economic dimensions, facilitates regional to global comparisons of adaptation advice
both within and across Blue Growth sectors.

AB  - Waste remediation (waste decomposition) is one of the ecosystem services (ES) salmon farming relies upon to reduce organic waste from the uneaten food and fish faeces through the metabolism of fauna and aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities. Our objective was to infer the changes that may occur in ecosystem capacity for reducing organic matter by firstly verifying that an impact has occurred using the AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and then relating that impact with changes in the ES of waste remediation reported in the literature. We relied on the combination of (i) the Driver, Activity, Pressure, change of State, Impact (Wellbeing), Response (Measure) (DAPSI(W)R(M)) approach as a causal model to establish relationships; (ii) the AMBI, as an impact indicator; and (iii) waste remediation capacity as the ES potentially affected by salmon farming. Data came from sites with different salmon farming influence located in Los Lagos and Aysen regions, Chile. Regression analyses were used to establish causal relationships between (i) total organic matter and oxygen availability, (ii) oxygen availability and AMBI and (iii) dominance of ecological groups and oxygen availability gradient. Ecological indices were estimated for each site. DAPSI(W)R(M) allowed to determine that food provision as the driver of salmon farming activity produced an environmental pressure (organic matter), which caused a significant reduction in oxygen availability, indicator of state change. The main impact was due to a decrease in the oxygen availability. High representation of species of the ecological groups IV (e.g. Nassarius coppingeri) and V (e.g. Capitella capitata) in the most impacted sites suggests increased organic matter processing. The ecosystem is coping with the increase of total organic matter by changing macrofauna composition at expenses of a decrease in biological diversity and an increase in species dominance. Overall, the results indicated that salmon farming impacts could be related to the ES of waste remediation.

AB  - Intensive striped catfish production in the Mekong Delta has, in recent years, raised environmental concerns. We conducted a stakeholder-based screening life cycle assessment (LCA) of the intensive farming system to determine the critical environmental impact and their causative processes in producing striped catfish. Additional to the LCA, we assessed water use and flooding hazards in the Mekong Delta. The goal and scope of the LCA were defined in a stakeholder workshop. It was decided there to include all processes up to the exit-gate of the fish farm in the inventory and to focus life cycle impact assessment on global warming, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, and marine (MAET) and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FWET). A survey was used to collect primary inventory data from 28 farms on fish grow-out, and from seven feed mills. Hatching and nursing of striped catfish fingerlings were not included in the assessment due to limited data availability and low estimated impact. Average feed composition for all farms had to be applied due to limitation of budget and data availability. Feed ingredient production, transport and milling dominated most of the impact categories in the LCA except for eutrophication and FWET. Most feed ingredients were produced outside Vietnam, and the impact of transport was important. Because of the screening character of this LCA, generic instead of specific inventory data were used for modelling feed ingredient production. However, the use of generic data is unlikely to have affected the main findings, given the dominance of feed production in all impact categories. Of the feed ingredients, rice bran contributed the most to global warming and acidification, while wheat bran contributed the most to eutrophication. The dominance of both was mainly due to the amounts used. Fishmeal production, transport and energy contributed the most to MAET. The biggest impacts of grow-out farming in Vietnam are on eutrophication and FWET. Water nutrient discharge from grow-out farming was high but negligible compared with the natural nutrient content of the Mekong River. The discharge from all grow-out farms together hardly modified river water quality compared with that before sector expansion. Feed production, i.e. ingredient production and transport and milling, remains the main contributor to most impact categories. It contributes indirectly to eutrophication and FWET through the pond effluents. The environmental impact of Pangasius grow-out farming can be reduced by effectively managing sludge and by using feeds with lower feed conversion ratio and lower content of fishery products in the feed. To consider farm variability, a next LCA of aquaculture should enlist closer collaboration from several feed-milling companies and sample farms using their feeds. Future LCAs should also preferably collect specific instead of generic inventory data for feed ingredient production, and include biodiversity and primary production as impact categories.

AB  - The use of farmed and restocked fish to supplement the worldwide human consumption of fish, recreational fishing stocks, and conservation efforts, is growing at a rapid rate. Yet, monitoring the benefits of using hatchery-raised fish for supplementation is lacking, often due to hatcheries not marking or tagging all fish prior to release, despite a range of easy to apply, cost effective and accurate mass-marking methods being available to mark farmed and restocked fish en masse. Here we review otolith marking techniques that have the capability of mass marking millions of hatchery-reared fish that are, or could be, used for monitoring and compliance purposes. The otolith mass marking methods consist of otolith thermal marking and a range of otolith chemical marking methods (tetracyclines, alizarin compounds, calcein, strontium chloride, stable isotopes of Ba and Sr, and rare earth elements). We assessed and compared marking technique in terms of (1) ease of application, (2) cost of application, (3) mark retention and detectability, and (4) fish welfare. In addition, we determine the suitability of different otolith marking techniques for mass marking entire hatchery populations whether it be for restocking purposes, or for identifying and tracing escapees from aquaculture facilities. We conclude that although some techniques have restricted use due to regulations, the majority of otolith mass marking techniques are simple, easy to apply, cost effective and highly suitable for long term monitoring of hatchery produced fish.

AB  - Abstract In the Global North, Urban Agriculture (UA) is being considered as a way to overcome malnutrition and promote local, ethical production. UA can be understood through two phenomena integral to the capitalist mode of production: capital centralisation and rent. Centralisation explains why capitalist agriculture industrialises, while rent provides a theoretical framework for understanding how social and spatial relations structure urban land uses. Urban farming can occupy niches of the capitalist marketplace; however, its prospects for replacing large-scale agriculture and providing similar use-values are limited. Its expansion is bounded by rising land values expressed in rent, as Detroit’s urban farm, Markham’s food belt, Los Angeles’s community garden, and initiatives in other cities demonstrate. The key tasks for political ecologists are two-fold: situating UA within capital’s drive to accumulate and proposing strategic perspectives that challenge these inherent tendencies.

AB  - Mature male parr (MMP) represent an important alternative life-history strategy in Atlantic salmon populations. Previous studies indicate that the maturation size threshold for male parr varies among wild populations and is influenced by individual growth, environmental conditions, and genetics. More than ten generations of breeding have resulted in domesticated salmon displaying many genetic differences to wild salmon, including greatly increased growth rates. This may have resulted in domesticated fish with the potential to outgrow the size threshold for early maturation, or evolution of the size threshold of the trait itself. To investigate this, we performed a common-garden experiment under farming conditions using 4680 salmon from 39 families representing four wild, two wild-domesticated hybrid, and two domesticated strains. Domesticated salmon outgrew wild salmon 2–5-fold, and hybrids displayed intermediate growth. Overall, the numbers of MMP varied greatly among families and strains: averaging 4–12% in domesticated, 18–25% in hybrid, and 43–74% in the wild populations. However, when the influence of growth was accounted for, by dividing fish into lower and upper size modes, no difference in the incidence of MMP was detected among domesticated and wild strains in either size mode. In the lower size mode, hybrids displayed significantly lower incidences of mature males than their wild parental strains. No consistent differences in the body size of MMP, connected to domestication, was detected. Our data demonstrate: 1- no evidence for the evolution of the size threshold for MMP in domesticated salmon, 2- the vastly lower incidence of MMP in domesticated strains under aquaculture conditions is primarily due to their genetically increased growth rate causing them to outgrow the size threshold for early maturation, 3- the incidence of MMP is likely to overlap among domesticated and wild salmon in the natural habitat where they typically display overlapping growth, although hybrid offspring may display lower incidences of mature male parr. These results have implications for wild salmon populations that are exposed to introgression from domesticated escapees.

AB  - Farmed Atlantic salmon escape unintentionally from hatcheries and fish farm and occur both in the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. These fish exploit natural feeding areas in fresh water and at sea, introgress natural populations (Fleming et al. 2000; O’Reilly et al. 2006; Castillo et al. 2008), and reduce the survival of wild populations that are exposed to salmon farms (Ford and Myers 2008). Worldwide salmonid aquaculture production has grown rapidly during the last 30–40 years, from less than 200,000 tonnes in 1970 to over one million tonnes in 2000 (Tacon 2003), and the production has continued to increase to more than 1.4 million tonnes in 2007 (FAO 2010). With this increase, the number of escaped farmed salmon has also increased through regular low-level leakages and episodic events such as wreckage of rearing pens at sea because of heavy weather.

AB  - Puberty comprises the transition from an immature juvenile to a mature adult state of the reproductive system, i.e. the individual becomes capable of reproducing sexually for the first time, which implies functional competence of the brain-pituitary-gonad (BPG) axis. Early puberty is a major problem in many farmed fish species due to negative effects on growth performance, flesh composition, external appearance, behaviour, health, welfare and survival, as well as possible genetic impact on wild populations. Late puberty can also be a problem for broodstock management in some species, while some species completely fail to enter puberty under farming conditions. Age and size at puberty varies between and within species and strains, and are modulated by genetic and environmental factors. Puberty onset is controlled by activation of the BPG axis, and a range of internal and external factors are hypothesised to stimulate and/or modulate this activation such as growth, adiposity, feed intake, photoperiod, temperature and social factors. For example, there is a positive correlation between rapid growth and early puberty in fish. Age at puberty can be controlled by selective breeding or control of photoperiod, feeding or temperature. Monosex stocks can exploit sex dimorphic growth patterns and sterility can be achieved by triploidisation. However, all these techniques have limitations under commercial farming conditions. Further knowledge is needed on both basic and applied aspects of puberty control to refine existing methods and to develop new methods that are efficient in terms of production and acceptable in terms of fish welfare and sustainability.

AB  - Infectious diseases are key drivers of wildlife populations and agriculture production, but whether and how climate change will influence disease impacts remains controversial. One of the critical knowledge gaps that prevents resolution of this controversy is a lack of high-quality experimental data, especially in marine systems of significant ecological and economic consequence. Here, we performed a manipulative experiment in which we tested the temperature-dependent effects on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis)—a parasite that can depress the productivity of wild-salmon populations and the profits of the salmon-farming industry. We explored sea-louse impacts on their hosts across a range of temperatures (10, 13, 16, 19, and 22 °C) and infestation levels (zero, ‘low’ (mean abundance ± SE = 1.6 ± 0.1 lice per fish), and ‘high’ infestation (6.8 ± 0.4 lice per fish)). We found that the effects of sea lice on the growth rate, condition, and survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon all worsen with increasing temperature. Our results provide a rare empirical example of how climate change may influence the impacts of marine disease in a key social-ecological system. These findings underscore the importance of considering climate-driven changes to disease impacts in wildlife conservation and agriculture.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The main issue affecting the conservation of most pinniped species has been identified as interactions with fisheries and aquaculture. In South American waters in particular, this problem has not been well evaluated. Consequently, there is an urgent need for research and conservation measures to address the problem, particularly for species of conservation concern.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>In this study, we reviewed published and unpublished research and observations from the last 25 years on operational and biological interactions between pinnipeds and fisheries and salmonid aquaculture activities in South American waters, and the conservation and management implications of these interactions in the near future.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Two species of pinnipeds are primarily involved in biological and operational interactions with fisheries and aquaculture in South America: the South American sea lion <jats:italic>Otaria flavescens</jats:italic> and the South American fur seal <jats:italic>Arctocephalus australis</jats:italic>. Although phocids are present in South American waters, there is no published research on conflicts between phocids and human activities.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Interactions between fisheries and pinnipeds have been reported by many countries. In South American waters, interactions mostly involve male and subadult male South American sea lions. However, despite the high frequency of interactions, the estimated economic losses to fisheries and aquaculture related to sea lion depredation are generally low.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Incidental capture and mortality of pinnipeds has been reported, especially in artisanal gillnet fisheries and in industrial purse seine and trawl fisheries. Mortality of sea lions in salmonid aquaculture has been reported, but the magnitude of the problem is unknown.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>In South America, limited progress has been made to incorporate mitigation measures, such as time‐area closures, acoustic deterrent devices, and modifications to fishing gear, into fisheries and aquaculture. This is likely to be due to our limited understanding of ecosystem complexity, the costs of modifying fishing gear or incorporating acoustic deterrent devices, and the scarcity of fishing controls. We suggest that strategies for effectively reducing conflicts between pinnipeds, fisheries, and aquaculture should involve all stakeholders in participative research to facilitate co‐management.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

AB  - <jats:p>Antibiotics have been commonly used as antimicrobial agents in the process of aquaculture worldwide. However, very few studies are available on the endocrine disruption-related health risks brought about by antibiotic residues from human consumption of aquatic products. Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) could mediate many endocrine-disrupting activities. Therefore, in the present study, a reverse docking method was used to predict the direct binding interactions between 16 NHR conformations and 15 common antibiotics in aquaculture, thereby determining their potential endocrine-disrupting risks. To reach a compromise between the extremely scarce experimental data and an urgent need for distinguishing antibiotics of high concern with potential food-borne endocrine-disrupting risks in aquaculture, a risk-ranking system was then developed based on a comprehensive risk score for each category of antibiotics, which was the sum of the products of endocrine-disrupting potential coefficients and annual usages of antibiotics in aquaculture. The results indicated that 15% of 224 docking simulations showed a relatively high probability of binding. Sulfonamides seemed to possess the greatest endocrine-disrupting potential. The antagonistic conformation of the androgen receptor was the most susceptible NHR conformation. The rank orders of the endocrine-disrupting risk of different categories of antibiotics varied greatly from country to country, which were significantly affected by the annual usage. These findings pose questions regarding public health and safety associated with human consumption of antibiotic-containing aquatic products. In addition, we provide an approach to rank antibiotics for a specific country or region, with respect to their potential endocrine-disrupting activity, that can be used to inform regulation and prioritize experimental verification.</jats:p>

AB  - Being adept at crafting national policy inherently demands that those at the table have a deep and comprehensive understanding of problem areas, and of historical details associated with progress that has been made, and that which has yet to be made. Undertaking the task of crafting national strategies, or engaging in policy discussions without possessing the prerequisites can predictably produce a variety of nationally degrading effects. Those effects include mounting public costs associated with irrational policy mis-adventures, lost opportunity costs that may not ever be recoverable, remediation costs, and costs associated with detrimental impacts on select demographies, or whole populations. Such is the story of US National Security Strategy for the Water Sector. When crafting a national policy schematic to encompass the 'water sector,' the manner in which water is to be available, the types of, and quantities of water needed for human consumption - cannot be items in a side-parlor discussion, nor can key environmental considerations that have the potential to affect the quality and quantity of water the human race will need. Solutions are difficult to conceive and much less implement, in large part due to an imposing public perception that high complexity has infiltrated every aspect of our lives, and that complexity presents an insurmountable eventuality. Such a perception has carried on creating a monolithic sensation, a mental impression, and a standing and unchallenged political justification for inaction in the face of multiple escalating challenges, with the titanic potential to amount to great national consequences. This body of work recounts certain shortfalls in the analyses - used to conceive and place into service, the US National Security Strategy for the Water Sector. Additionally, a reformed and renewed 'cooperative engineering' orientation capable of delivering an efficient, effective, beneficial and complete National Security Strategy policy framework in introduced - drawn from the need for tightly coupled interoperability amongst multiple variables/entities in the national strategy spaces, policy spaces and the operational spaces, with strong considerations of historicals.

AB  - Over the past 60-70 years, the invasive Indo-Pacific coral Tubastraea coccinea (Lesson 1830; Cnidaria, Scleractinia) has colonized the western tropical Atlantic Ocean - the Americas, the Antilles, northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), and many of its 3,600 oil/gas platforms. It is now the single, most abundant coral on artificial substrata in the GOM, with hundreds of thousands of colonies on a single platform. Here, we report for the first time the observation of a closely related congener in the western Atlantic – the Indo-Pacific azooxanthellate Tubastraea micranthus (Ehrenberg 1834) – and suggest that it may pose a threat similar to T. coccinea. A total of 83 platforms, including deep-water, toppled, Rigs-to-Reefs structures, were surveyed in the northern Gulf of Mexico between 2000 and 2009, from Matagorda Island, Texas to Mobile, Alabama, USA, between the depths of 7 and 37 m, by SCUBA divers. Five platforms were surveyed by Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to depths of up to 117 m. T. micranthus was found on only one platform – Grand Isle 93 (GI-93), off Port Fourchon, Louisiana, near the Mississippi River mouth, at the cross-roads of two major safety fairways/shipping lanes transited by large international commercial ships.

AB  - The literature on sustainable diets is broad in its scope, and application yet is consistently supportive of a move away from animal-based diets towards more plant-based diets. The positioning of seafood within the sustainable diet literature is less clear. A literature review was conducted to examine how the environmental impacts of seafood consumption are assessed and what conclusions are being drawn about the inclusion of seafood in a sustainable diet. Seafood is an essential part of the global food system but is not adequately addressed in most of the sustainable diet literature. Aquaculture, the world's fastest growing food sector, was considered by very few papers. Seafood consumption was commonly presented as a dilemma due to the perceived trade-offs between positive health outcomes from eating seafood and concerns of overfishing. A number of studies included seafood as part of their sustainable diet scenario, or as part of a diet that had lower impacts than current consumption. Most of the indicators used were biophysical, with a strong focus on greenhouse gas emissions, and very few studies addressed biological or ecological impacts. The assessment of seafood was limited in many studies due to relevant data sets not being incorporated into the models used. Where they were used, data sources and methodological choices were often not stated thereby limiting the transparency of many studies. Both farmed and wild-capture production methods need to be integrated into research on the impacts of diets and future food scenarios to better understand and promote the benefits of sustainable diets.

AB  - The status and potential of aquaculture is considered as part of a broader food landscape of wild aquatic and terrestrial food sources. The rationale and resource base required for the development of aquaculture are considered in the context of broader societal development, cultural preferences and human needs. Attention is drawn to the uneven development and current importance of aquaculture globally as well as its considerable heterogeneity of form and function compared with established terrestrial livestock production. The recent drivers of growth in demand and production are examined and the persistent linkages between exploitation of wild stocks, full life cycle culture and the various intermediate forms explored. An emergent trend for sourcing aquaculture feeds from alternatives to marine ingredients is described and the implications for the sector with rapidly growing feed needs discussed. The rise of non-conventional and innovative feed ingredients, often shared with terrestrial livestock, are considered, including aquaculture itself becoming a major source of marine ingredients. The implications for the continued expected growth of aquaculture are set in the context of sustainable intensification, with the challenges that conventional intensification and emergent integration within, and between, value chains explored. The review concludes with a consideration of the implications for dependent livelihoods and projections for various futures based on limited resources but growing demand.

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector and it contributes significantly to global food security. Based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, aquaculture production must increase significantly to meet the future global demand for aquatic foods in 2050. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and FAO, climate change may result in global warming, sea level rise, changes of ocean productivity, freshwater shortage, and more frequent extreme climate events. Consequently, climate change may affect aquaculture to various extents depending on climatic zones, geographical areas, rearing systems, and species farmed. There are 2 major challenges for aquaculture caused by climate change. First, the current fish, adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions, may be suboptimal under future conditions. Fish species are often poikilothermic and, therefore, may be particularly vulnerable to temperature changes. This will make low sensitivity to temperature more important for fish than for livestock and other terrestrial species. Second, climate change may facilitate outbreaks of existing and new pathogens or parasites. To cope with the challenges above, 3 major adaptive strategies are identified. First, general 'robustness' will become a key trait in aquaculture, whereby fish will be less vulnerable to current and new diseases while at the same time thriving in a wider range of temperatures. Second, aquaculture activities, such as input power, transport, and feed production contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Selection for feed efficiency as well as defining a breeding goal that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions will reduce impacts of aquaculture on climate change. Finally, the limited adoption of breeding programs in aquaculture is a major concern. This implies inefficient use of resources for feed, water, and land. Consequently, the carbon footprint per kg fish produced is greater than when fish from breeding programs would be more heavily used. Aquaculture should use genetically improved and robust organisms not suffering from inbreeding depression. This will require using fish from well-managed selective breeding programs with proper inbreeding control and breeding goals. Policymakers and breeding organizations should provide incentives to boost selective breeding programs in aquaculture for more robust fish tolerating climatic change.

AB  - Norwegian production of salmon is highly export oriented, making access to efficient supply chains an important success criterion for exporters of salmon. The role of the buyers in the supply chain has so far received limited attention in the empirical literature on seafood trade. In this paper, I utilize customs data for the period 2016–2019 to investigate structure and trade margins for buyers of salmon products from Norway and potential differences in exporter-buyer links between producers and intermediaries. Several insights about buyers in the salmon supply chain are provided. There is large heterogeneity in the number of buyers within as well as between different destination markets, and the main buyers in the largest markets source their products from both producers and intermediaries. The buyer margin of exports is important in overall Norwegian salmon exports and highly sensitive to standard gravity variables. Finally, vertically integrated buyers on average trade in larger values and volumes, ship more frequently and obtain lower prices.

AB  - Prospective evaluation of the lifecycle impacts of aviation biofuel production in Abu Dhabi, UAE based on a production system that integrates aquaculture, saltwater agriculture, and mangrove silviculture, termed an Integrated Seawater Energy Agriculture System (ISEAS) in order to investigate its energetic and environmental potential compared to conventional fuels. We compare the hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) produced from ISEAS against fossil jet fuel using a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Based on a detailed description of the production process, we use data from a wide-ranging literature review and experimental results from the specific location to make informed assumptions for the range of the process inputs and yields. We then analyze several process configuration scenarios with different ranges. ISEAS can produce aviation biofuels, electricity, and food while afforesting coastal desert land, acting as a long-term sink for carbon, minimizing freshwater consumption, and having beneficial land use impacts when compared to fossil jet fuel production. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we show that ISEAS HRJ emits 38 to 68% less greenhouse gases than fossil jet fuel and yields an overall positive net energy balance under all scenarios except one with an extensive use of desalinated water. ISEAS offers a promising pathway for integrating aquaculture and seawater agriculture in arid regions. It is essentially a process to sustainably augment aquaculture-based products by using its waste as a biofuel resource. Achieving positive emissions results depend critically on minimizing freshwater use, maximizing biomass yield and to a lesser extent the performance of biomass gasification.

ISSN 0029-1951Norway has signed the European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD), according to which all water bodies are expected to have ‘good ecological status’ by 2021. An ongoing debate about the environmental impacts of aquaculture is related particularly to the impact on wild salmon of the spread of salmon lice and escaped farmed fish. The authors examine the key arguments concerning the environmental impact of salmon farming, and how knowledge is produced and marshalled in the dispute. How does the framing of knowledge and authority affect the apportioning of responsibility for taking appropriate measures to mitigate negative effects? The questions are addressed by drawing on insights from critical political ecology and work on governance scales, and by analysing relevant docume...

AB  - Aquaculture has emerged as one of the world's fastest-growing food industries in recent years, helping food security and boosting global economic status. The indiscriminate disposal of untreated or improperly managed waste and effluents from different sources including production plants, food processing sectors, and healthcare sectors release various contaminants such as bioactive compounds and unmetabolized antibiotics, and antibiotic-resistant organisms into the environment. These emerging contaminants (ECs), especially antibiotics, have the potential to pollute the environment, particularly the aquatic ecosystem due to their widespread use in aquaculture, leading to various toxicological effects on aquatic organisms as well as long-term persistence in the environment. However, various forms of nanotechnology-based technologies are now being explored to assist other remediation technologies to boost productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. In this review, we critically highlighted several ecofriendly nanotechnological methods including nanodrug and vaccine delivery, nanoformulations, and nanosensor for their antimicrobial effects in aquaculture and aquatic organisms, potential public health risks associated with nanoparticles, and their mitigation measures for sustainable management.

AB  - ABSTRACTNorthern coastal regions are facing multiple challenges from accelerating global environmental and socioeconomic changes, such as ecosystem degradation, climate change, intensified resource extraction, land use change and declining populations. Based on interviews with 13 farmers, fishers and aquaculture employees from coastal Nordland, northern Norway, this study demonstrates how the local stakeholders’ perceptions of change and experiences of vulnerability are closely linked to their livelihood values and worldviews. What the informants consider a sustainable and meaningful way of coastal living does not coincide with national goals for sustainable, natural resource dependent development of the region. The article demonstrates the importance of attending to local values if policymakers and managers are to ensure successful local mobilisation, reduce vulnerability to ongoing and future processes of change, and ensure legitimacy and consistency in development goals of coastal zone management.

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest-growing farmed food sector and will soon become the primary source of fish and shellfish for human diets. In contrast to crop and livestock production, aquaculture production is derived from numerous, exceptionally diverse species that are typically in the early stages of domestication. Genetic improvement of production traits via well-designed, managed breeding programmes has great potential to help meet the rising seafood demand driven by human population growth. Supported by continuous advances in sequencing and bioinformatics, genomics is increasingly being applied across the broad range of aquaculture species and at all stages of the domestication process to optimize selective breeding. In the future, combining genomic selection with biotechnological innovations, such as genome editing and surrogate broodstock technologies, may further expedite genetic improvement in aquaculture.

AB  - <jats:p>Climate change is affecting large-scale oceanic processes. How and when these changes will impact those reliant on marine resources is not yet clear. Here we use end-to-end modeling to track the impacts of expected changes through the marine ecosystem on a specific, small community: Cochamó, in the Gulf of Ancud wider area, Chile. This area is important for Chilean fisheries and aquaculture, with Cochamó reliant on both lower and upper trophic level marine resources. We applied the GOTM-ERSEM-BFM coupled hydro-biogeochemical water-column model to gauge lower-trophic level marine ecological community response to bottom-up stressors (climate change, ocean acidification), coupled to an existing Ecopath with Ecosim model for the area, which included top-down stressors (fishing). Social scientists also used participatory modeling (Systems Thinking and Bayesian Belief Networking) to identify key resources for Cochamó residents and to assess the community’s vulnerability to possible changes in key resources. Modeling results suggest that flagellate phytoplankton abundance will increase at the cost of other species (particularly diatoms), resulting in a greater risk of harmful algae blooms. Both climate change and acidification slightly increased primary production in the model. Higher trophic level results indicate that some targeted pelagic resources will decline (while benthic ones may benefit), but that these effects might be mitigated by strong fisheries management efforts. Participatory modeling suggests that Cochamó inhabitants anticipate marine ecosystem changes but are divided about possible adaptation strategies. For climate change impact quantification, detailed experimental studies are recommended based on the dominant threats identified here, with specific local species.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Limited stocking efforts to introduce Atlantic salmon <jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic> into Chilean rivers and streams were unsuccessful during the 20<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> century. Following the arrival of the aquaculture industry during the 1980s, escaped Atlantic salmon have presented an ecological risk to native taxa through predation, competition, and transmission of pathogens or parasites. However, whether commercial aquaculture strains represent the likely source of free-living Atlantic salmon in marine and freshwater environments is unclear. We used 272 single nucleotide polymorphisms to characterize free-living Atlantic salmon (n = 80) captured from 12 marine and freshwater locations in southern Chile. These were compared with 8 reference collections, 6 known commercial strains, and 2 wild populations of Atlantic salmon. We evaluated genetic structure among free-living Atlantic salmon and assessed individual ancestry and origin by assigning mixture samples to reference collections. We found evidence for genetic structure (number of clusters, <jats:italic>K</jats:italic> = 3) among free-living salmon unexplained by geography, environment, or life stage, but consistent with the number of clusters among commercial aquaculture strains. Most free-living Atlantic salmon had a close ancestry with farmed Norwegian strains, the most widely used by the industry, pointing to recent aquaculture escapes as their origin. Yet recent establishment of self-sustaining populations weakly differentiated from aquaculture broodstock cannot be ruled out. We propose increasing monitoring efforts of free-living Atlantic salmon in remote sites as well as in watersheds located in densely stocked aquaculture areas.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>While the UK is the fourth largest aquaculture producer in Europe by volume, it is the second largest by value with an annual first sale value of around £1 billion. Over 90% of this value is from Atlantic salmon farmed in Scotland, but other finfish and shellfish aquaculture species are important to several UK regions. In this review, we describe the state of the art in UK aquaculture breeding and stock supply, and how innovation in genetics technologies can help achieve the Scottish Government’s ambitious target of doubling its aquaculture industry by 2030. Particular attention is given to the four most important UK aquaculture species: Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, blue mussel and Pacific oyster, and we contrast the highly variable level of selective breeding and genomics technologies used in these sectors. A major factor in the success of Atlantic salmon farming has been large‐scale investment in modern breeding programmes, including family selection programmes and genomic selection. This has proven cost‐effective at scale, leading to improved production efficiency and reduction of some infectious diseases. We discuss the feasibility of applying similar technologies to the UK shellfish sectors, to ensure consistent and robust spat supply and begin trait selection. Furthermore, we discuss species‐specific application of modern breeding technologies in a global context, and the future potential of genomics and genome editing technologies to improve commercially desirable traits. Increased adoption of modern breeding technologies will assist UK aquaculture industries to meet the challenges for sustainable expansion, and remain competitive in a global market.</jats:p>

AB  - The sustainability of aquaculture is a complex issue that can be hard to assess and communicate. Communicating it to the general public is in many ways an even bigger challenge than communicating to experts on sustainability or aquaculture. The general public’s perception of the status and challenges for sustainability is important for the development of the aquaculture industry and for society at large, through its roles both as consumers and electorate, and generally in providing or denying a “social license to operate” for the industry. This paper presents the process and challenges involved in choosing and quality assuring sustainability indicators for Norwegian aquaculture, covering environmental, economic and social dimensions. It involved a team of researchers, a quality assurance group, IT developers and designers, a literature review, a national survey and user-testing, all to establish criteria for selecting data and indicators and how to present them, and to do the actual production. The endpoint is a web-portal with indicators currently covering 20 themes, aimed at anyone interested in the sustainability of Norwegian fish farming. The portal does not conclude if or to what degree Norwegian fish farming is sustainable, as that would require making valuation and trade-offs among different sustainability objectives. Data are only from public available sources, and produced by the authorities or research institutions. Many indicators are automatically updated. The portal is under continuous development, with new themes and indicators, and improving spatial and temporal resolution.

AB  - <jats:p>Sea trout are known for seeking out sources of freshwater to rid themselves of salmon lice. However, the effect of natural haloclines in fjords on parasite dynamics is not well understood. We tagged 48 naturally infested wild sea trout with acoustic depth sensors. The fish were kept inside a small net-pen (4 × 4 × 5 m), 12 at a time, in western Norway during 4 separate time periods in spring 2017. The sea trout were relatively highly infested with sea lice (prevalence: 100%, mean ± SD: 68 ± 58 lice fish<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>), and a relatively large proportion of the individuals did not survive the trials (25% mortality). The results show that temperature and light were the 2 most important factors explaining the vertical behaviour of the surviving trout. Mobile lice also had a significant effect on depth distribution, where fish with higher abundances of lice were observed at shallower depths. During the 7 d periods in the net-pen, total sea louse abundance decreased from a mean of 68 to 35 fish<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Surface salinity explained this reduction better than the experienced salinity of the individual fish, suggesting that short-time exposure to very low salinities, rather than long-term exposure to moderate salinities, is the driving force behind the effect of haloclines on reduction in sea lice numbers.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Offshore aquaculture has gained momentum in recent years, and the production of an increasing number of marine fish species is being relocated offshore. Initially, predictions of the advantages that offshore aquaculture would present over nearshore farming were made without enough science‐based evidence. Now, with more scientific knowledge, this review revisits past predictions and expectations of offshore aquaculture. We analysed and explained the oceanographic features that define offshore and nearshore sites. Using Atlantic salmon (<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>) as a case study, we focussed on sea lice, amoebic gill disease, and the risk of harmful algal blooms, as well as the direct effects of the oceanography on the health and physiology of fish. The operational and licencing challenges and advantages of offshore aquaculture are also considered. The lack of space in increasingly saturated sheltered areas will push new farms out to offshore locations and, if appropriate steps are followed, offshore aquaculture can be successful. Firstly, the physical capabilities of the farmed fish species and infrastructure must be fully understood. Secondly, the oceanography of potential sites must be carefully studied to confirm that they are compatible with the species‐specific capabilities. And, thirdly, an economic plan considering the operational costs and licencing limitations of the site must be developed. This review will serve as a guide and a compilation of information for researchers and stakeholders.</jats:p>

AB  - With the rapid development of mariculture, environmental pollution is becoming more and more serious. It is particularly important to study the green output bias of technological progress for the long-term sustainable development of mariculture. Based on the input-output data of the mariculture in 10 Chinese coastal areas from 2008 to 2018, the DEA-Malmquist index decomposition method is used to calculate the output-biased technological progress index and combines with the change of marginal substitution rate of output factors in different periods to identify the bias of technological progress between output factors and analyze the green output bias of mariculture technological progress. The results show that green technological progress is a crucial factor affecting green total factor productivity's growth in China's mariculture. During the study period, the number of regions where technological progress tends to reduce pollutant emissions shows a fluctuating upward trend, and the degree of technological progress toward green output is high. There are obvious differences among regions. The green output bias of technological progress in the South China Sea area is the highest, followed by the East China Sea area, and the Bohai Sea area is poor. Specifically, the green output bias of technological progress in Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan is higher, while the green output bias of technological progress in Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, and Guangxi is lower. According to the research results, corresponding policy suggestions are provided to realize the green and sustainable development of China's mariculture.

AB  - Atlantic salmon farming is one of the largest aquaculture sectors in the world. A major impact on farm economics, fish welfare and, potentially, nearby wild salmonid populations, is the sea louse ectoparasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Sea louse infestations are most often controlled through application of chemicals, but in most farming regions, sea lice have evolved resistance to the small set of available chemicals. Therefore, alternative treatment methodologies are becoming more widely used. One increasingly common alternative treatment involves the co-culture of farmed salmon with cleaner fish, which prey on sea lice. However, despite their wide use, little is understood about the situations in which cleaner fish are most effective. For example, previous work suggests that a low parasite density results in sea lice finding it difficult to acquire mates, reducing fecundity and population growth. Other work suggests that environmental conditions such as temperature and external sea louse pressure have substantial impact on this mate limitation threshold and may even remove the effect entirely. We used an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate cleaner fish on a salmon farm to explore interactions between sea louse mating behaviour, cleaner fish feeding rate, temperature and external sea louse pressure. We found that sea louse mating has a substantial effect on sea louse infestations under a variety of environmental conditions. Our results suggest that cleaner fish can control sea louse infestations most effectively by maintaining the population below critical density thresholds.

AB  - The growth and recapture rates of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., smolts that had previously matured as parr were compared with those of immature siblings in a sea-ranching experiment in western Norway. The smolts were the offspring of three river populations. They were individually tagged, transferred to cages in a small bay where estuarine salinity gradients had been established and released on four dates from mid-May to early June after either 3 or 7 days of acclimatisation. The previously mature male parr (PMMP) were smaller than their siblings before release, but performed much better during their time in the sea. As grilse, they reached sizes comparable with the formerly immature fish, and their recapture rate was more than four times higher (8.6 vs 2.1%). This difference decreased somewhat during the following years because 0.85% of the immature fish and only 0.1% of PMMP were recaptured as multi-sea-winter salmon. The highly successful marine performance of the PMMP demonstrated that this life history strategy may be more flexible than previously believed.

AB  - Temperature is hypothesized to contribute to increased pathogenicity and virulence of many marine diseases. The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of matrix population modelling for epidemiological studies.

AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food production sectors and has great potential for food security and livelihoods. However, it generates concerning consequences for the environment, including chemical and biological pollution, disease outbreaks, unsustainable feeds and competition for coastal space. Recent investigations are focusing on sustainable techniques (e.g., polyculture, offshore facilities) to improve the relationship between the industry, environment and society. This review provides an overview of the main factors of ecological concern within marine finfish aquaculture, their interactions with the environment, and highlights sustainable alternatives that are currently in use or development. Adequate environmental monitoring and location of farms, the reduction and exploitation of wastes and chemicals being used is crucial to ensure the growth and continuity of aquaculture production.

AB  - Temperature increases in Norwegian waters are likely to influence productivity for salmonid aquaculture. As sites are experiencing different temperature regimes, the impact on productivity will vary. The spatial distribution of Norwegian salmon farming depends on both institutional and physical conditions. At present, the general location of farms is restricted by the authorities, but in the case of large productivity differences, this regime may be liberalized. This study analyzes the impact of increased temperature on the spatial distribution of production and employment. We vary temperature and management regime in four scenarios and a 30 year time span. Total production is based on linear demand growth, serving as a restriction in the subsequent model. Productivity per county is determined in a temperature-driven model, and a separate model predicts the relocation of licenses between counties. An input–output model captures the direct and indirect effects of aquaculture production. Our findings indica...

AB  - Latin America (LATAM) plays an important role in the world's production of aquatic animals and is the second most productive region in the world. Chile, Ecuador, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Perú contribute 87% of LATAM aquaculture production. The fish welfare in aquaculture is of increasing public concern globally, and LATAM is no exception, growing in importance for fish farmers, authorities, and scientists. Although the topic is somewhat controversial, the welfare status of farmed fish has direct implications for their production and the sustainability of the industry. Therefore, this study analyses scientific papers on animal welfare in farmed fish, from the six countries in LATAM with the highest aquaculture production. The main objectives were to quantify the number of papers published between 2000 and 2023 on fish welfare by using scientific databases. A total of 285 papers were found for the period analysed. The country with the largest number of publications was Brazil (75.79%), followed by Chile (13.33%), Mexico (7.02%), Peru (1.75%), Ecuador, and Colombia (1.05%). Nile tilapia was the most studied species, appearing in 30.18% of the publications, with most of the studies mainly dealing with nutrition (32.28%). The growth of aquaculture is leading to joint efforts to generate knowledge on welfare issues, especially in poorly studied species with high production, to create policies that help minimize welfare risks. Given this, the insights generated by this review could be a useful addition to approaches investigating the trends and concepts of fish welfare in LATAM.

AB  - Understanding habitat requirements for spawning is important for species at risk of extirpation to define areas for protection of this critical life stage. Interior Fraser coho salmon (IFC) Oncorhynchus kisutch spawn in tributaries of the upper Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. They are regionally isolated, genetically distinct, and have been listed as endangered. Recent enumeration efforts have shown declining escapement and range contraction. IFC spawn in snow-dominated watersheds, yet much of our understanding of spawner habitat requirements is based on information for coho from coastal rain-dominated systems. Consequently, we examined the relative influence of habitat features on spawning site selection. Our sampling focused on why fish chose particular locations and not others in what seemed to be suitable habitat. We defined several logistic regression models, including various combinations of physical, chemical and hydrological microhabitat features, and used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the relative plausibility of these models. Models combining intragravel measures of electrical conduc- tance, dissolved oxygen, temperature and specific discharge were the best models associated with spawning microhabitat selection, and jackknife validations showed that these models had good predictive abilities. Intragravel variables, therefore, appear to play a prominent role in spawning site selection for IFC. Understanding the influence of the intragravel environment on spawning site selection will help identify habitat requirements as well as potential threats to fish populations and will contribute to the development of comprehensive conservation initiatives.

AB  - Vaccination is a widely used control strategy to prevent Piscirickettsia salmonis causing disease in salmon farming. However, it is not known why all the currently available commercial vaccines generally fail to protect against this pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report, from two different populations, that between-family variation is a strong intrinsic factor that determines vaccine protection for this disease. While in some full-sib families, the protection added by vaccination increased the survival time in 13 days in comparison with their unvaccinated siblings; in other families, there was no added protection by vaccination or even it was slightly negative. Resistance to P. salmonis, measured as days to death, was higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated fish, but only a moderate positive genetic correlation was obtained between these traits. This disputes a previous hypothesis, that stated that both traits were fully controlled by the same genes, and challenges the use of unvaccinated fish as gold standard for evaluating and selecting fish resistant to P. salmonis, particularly if the offspring will be vaccinated. More studies are necessary to evaluate if variation in the host immune response to vaccination could explain the between-family differences in resistance observed in vaccinated fish.

AB  - Throughout their native range, wild Atlantic salmon populations are threatened by hybridization and introgression with escapees from net-pen salmon aquaculture. Although domestic-wild hybrid offspring have shown reduced fitness in laboratory and field experiments, consequential impacts on population abundance and genetic integrity remain difficult to predict in the field, in part because the strength of selection against domestic offspring is often unknown and context-dependent. Here, we follow a single large escape event of farmed Atlantic salmon in southern Newfoundland and monitor changes in the in-river proportions of hybrids and feral individuals over time using genetically based hybrid identification. Over a three-year period following the escape, the overall proportion of wild parr increased consistently (total wild proportion of 71.6%, 75.1% and 87.5% each year, respectively), with subsequent declines in feral (genetically pure farmed individuals originating from escaped, farmed adults) and hybrid parr. We quantify the strength of selection against parr of aquaculture ancestry and explore the genetic and demographic consequences for populations in the region. Within-cohort changes in the relative proportions of feral and F1 parr suggest reduced relative survival compared to wild individuals over the first (0.15 and 0.81 for feral and F1, respectively) and second years of life (0.26, 0.83). These relative survivorship estimates were used to inform an individual-based salmon eco-genetic model to project changes in adult abundance and overall allele frequency across three invasion scenarios ranging from short-term to long-term invasion and three relative survival scenarios. Modelling results indicate that total population abundance and time to recovery were greatly affected by relative survivorship and predict significant declines in wild population abundance under continued large escape events and calculated survivorship. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of estimating the strength of selection against domestic offspring in the wild to predict the long-term impact of farmed salmon escape events on wild populations.

AB  - This study demonstrated that increased dietary protein-to-lipid ratio (P/L-ratio) improved survival of farmed Atlantic salmon naturally affected by pancreas disease (PD). In addition to diet, body weight (BW) and delousing mortality prior to the PD outbreak also contributed significantly (p < 0.05) to explain the observed variation in PD-associated mortality. Subsequent to the PD outbreak, large amount of fish failed to grow and caused thin fish with poor condition (runts). At the end of the trial, significantly (p < 0.05) lower amounts of runt fish and increased amount of superior graded fish where detected among fish fed increased P/L-ratio and within the fish with the largest BWs prior to PD. Diet, BW and delousing mortality contributed significantly (p < 0.05) to explain the variation in the amount of superior graded fish, whereas BW and diet explained the variation in the amount of runt fish. A significant (p < 0.01) negative linear relationship was observed between the amount of superior graded fish and the total mortality, whereas a positive linear relationship was detected between percentage of fillets with melanin and the total mortality. Thus, increased dietary P/L-ratio seem to reduce the mortality and impaired slaughter quality associated with PD.

AB  - Abstract The transmission of pathogens is a common consequence of animal food production. Marine salmon farms and their processing facilities can serve as sources of virulent fish pathogens; our study is the first to confirm the broadcast of a live fish pathogen from a farmed salmon processing facility into the marine waters of Canada's Pacific coast. We found live salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis, mucus, and fish tissue in effluent from the processing facility. Sea lice transmitted from this source may pose a threat to wild salmon populations, and the release of untreated offal, including blood water, is of considerable concern. Further research is needed to quantify the extent to which processing facilities release sea lice and to determine whether more virulent fish pathogens are present in effluent. These data underscore the need for fish farming nations to develop mandatory biosecurity programs to ensure that farmed salmon processing facilities will prevent the broadcast of infectious fish pathoge...

AB  - Diseases cause ethical concerns and economic losses in the Salmonid industry. The mucus layer comprised of highly O-glycosylated mucins is the first contact between pathogens and fish. Mucin glycans govern pathogen adhesion, growth and virulence. The Atlantic salmon O-glycome from a single location has been characterized and the interindividual variation was low. Because interindividual variation is considered a population-based defense, hindering the entire population from being wiped out by a single infection, low interindividual variation among Atlantic salmon may be a concern. Here, we analyzed the O-glycome of 25 Atlantic salmon from six cohorts grown under various conditions from Sweden, Norway and Australia (Tasmania) using mass spectrometry. This expanded the known Atlantic salmon O-glycome by 60% to 169 identified structures. The mucin O-glycosylation was relatively stable over time within a geographical region, but the size of the fish affected skin mucin glycosylation. The skin mucin glycan repertoires from Swedish and Norwegian Atlantic salmon populations were closely related compared with Tasmanian ones, regardless of size and salinity, with differences in glycan size and composition. The internal mucin glycan repertoire also clustered based on geographical origin and into pyloric cecal and distal intestinal groups, regardless of cohort and fish size. Fucosylated structures were more abundant in Tasmanian pyloric caeca and distal intestine mucins compared with Swedish ones. Overall, Tasmanian Atlantic salmon mucins have more O-glycan structures in skin but less in the gastrointestinal tract compared with Swedish fish. Low interindividual variation was confirmed within each cohort. The results can serve as a library for identifying structures of importance for host-pathogen interactions, understanding population differences of salmon mucin glycosylation in resistance to diseases and during breeding and selection of strains. The results could make it possible to predict potential vulnerabilities to diseases and suggest that inter-region breeding may increase the glycan diversity.

AB  - Released individuals can have negative impacts on native populations through various mechanisms, including competition, disease transfer and introduction of maladapted gene complexes. Previous studies indicate that the level of farmed Atlantic salmon introgression in native populations is population specific. However, few studies have explored the potential role of population diversity or river characteristics, such as temperature, on the consequences of hybridization. We compared freshwater growth of multiple families derived from two farmed, five wild and two F1 hybrid salmon populations at three contrasting temperatures (7°C, 12°C and 16°C) in a common garden experiment. As expected, farmed salmon outgrew wild salmon at all temperatures, with hybrids displaying intermediate growth. However, differences in growth were population specific and some wild populations performed better than others relative to the hybrid and farmed populations at certain temperatures. Therefore, the competitive balance between farmed and wild salmon may depend both on the thermal profile of the river and on the genetic characteristics of the respective farmed and wild strains. While limited to F1 hybridization, this study shows the merits in adopting a more complex spatially resolved approach to risk management of local populations.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The diverse aquaculture sector makes important contributions toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)/Agenda 2030, and can increasingly do so in the future. Its important role for food security, nutrition, livelihoods, economies, and cultures is not clearly visible in the Agenda 21 declaration. This may partly reflect the state of development of policies for aquaculture compared with its terrestrial counterpart, agriculture, and possibly also because aquaculture production has historically originated from a few key hotspot regions/countries. This review highlights the need for better integration of aquaculture in global food system dialogues. Unpacking aquaculture's diverse functions and generation of values at multiple spatiotemporal scales enables better understanding of aquaculture's present and future potential contribution to the SDGs. Aquaculture is a unique sector that encompasses all aquatic ecosystems (freshwater, brackish/estuarine, and marine) and is also tightly interconnected with terrestrial ecosystems through, for example, feed resources and other dependencies. Understanding environmental, social, and economic characteristics of the multifaceted nature of aquaculture provides for more context‐specific solutions for addressing both opportunities and challenges for its future development. This review includes a rapid literature survey based on how aquaculture links to the specific SDG indicators. A conceptual framework is developed for communicating the importance of context specificity related to SDG outcomes from different types of aquaculture. The uniqueness of aquaculture's contributions compared with other food production systems are discussed, including understanding of species/systems diversity, the role of emerging aquaculture, and its interconnectedness with supporting systems. A selection of case studies is presented to illustrate: (1) the diversity of the aquaculture sector and what role this diversity can play for contributions to the SDGs, (2) examples of methodologies for identification of aquaculture's contribution to the SDGs, and (3) trade‐offs between farming systems’ contribution to meeting the SDGs. It becomes clear that decision‐making around resource allocation and trade‐offs between aquaculture and other aquatic resource users needs review of a wide range of established and emergent systems. The review ends by highlighting knowledge gaps and pathways for transformation that will allow further strengthening of aquaculture's role for contributing to the SDGs. This includes identification and building on already existing monitoring that can enable capturing SDG‐relevant aquaculture statistics at a national level and discussion of how a cohesive and comprehensive aquaculture strategy, framed to meet the SDGs, may help countries to prioritize actions for improving well‐being.</jats:p>

AB  - A number of studies have documented that there is a global market for salmon, in which wild and farmed salmon have a common price determination process. Recent studies report that Norwegian farmed salmon spot prices are also highly correlated with the Fish Pool salmon future contract price, indicating that the futures market can be an important risk management tool, as producers and buyers can hedge price risk. Here, we investigate whether the wild salmon prices can be cross hedged against the Fish Pool salmon future contract, by testing whether wild salmon prices are also correlated with the Fish Pool salmon future contracts. If so, the Fish Pool future contracts can be used as a risk management tool for fishers and buyers of wild salmon. We find that this is the case, providing an additional link between wild and farmed salmon specifically, and between fisheries and aquaculture generally.

(ii) the rendering process produces biofuels that are used to offset the use of fossil fuels, and (iii) 
palm oil and soya bean incur emissions from agriculture and land transformation.

AB  - Capitella sp. and Ophryotrocha craigsmithi received a diet of salmon feces to evaluatetheir potential to convert fish waste into valuable marine products, e.g. ingredients for fishfeed formulation. Production rate and body composition (focusing on fatty acid [FA] profiles)were determined for polychaetes fed fresh, acid-preserved or oven-dried salmon feces to evaluatetheir application in (de)coupled integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems. Coupledproduction refers to direct integration of fish and polychaetes within the same (eco)system,while in decoupled production, units can be spatially or functionally separated. For decoupledproduction, preservation of fish waste is recommended. Although diets contained relatively lowpolyunsaturated FA (PUFA) levels (5−9% of total FAs), both species were rich in PUFAs (>30%of total FAs) and contained the essential FAs for fish. Feeding Capitella sp. the acid-preserveddiet enriched its FA profile. Accumulation of PUFAs, de novo synthesis and/or transfer via bacterialbiomass could have played a role in the upregulation of PUFA content. Amino acid profilesindicated that these polychaetes contained the amino acids essential for fish. Highest growth forboth species was observed when fed fresh feces, whereas preserved diets resulted in negativegrowth rates for O. craigsmithi, suggesting an important role of microbes in polychaete diets.Our results indicate that both species are potential valuable marine products. Given growth rateswith different diets, O. craigsmithi seems more suitable for integration in coupled systems, whileCapitella sp. is interesting for both coupled and decoupled integrated systems

However, to date, pharmacological medicines have been the main tool used by the salmon farming industry in Chile to manage sea lice, although non‐pharmacological treatments have been available since 2016. Production of farmed salmon reached 978.274 tons in 2021 and 7.72 g of medicines was prescribed per ton of harvested salmon. The highest volumes used in that year were Azamethiphos (47%) and hexaflumuron (45.5%), in addition to 5532 tons of hydrogen peroxide.

AB  - Abstract The notable increase of aquaculture production in recent decades has in many instances been matched by growing concern for its impacts. Environmentalists, consumers and members of the general public are increasingly demanding to account for its resource use and to balance its proposed benefits with its environmental sustainability. Although conventional financial and economic analyses have demonstrated a broadly positive impact for many forms of aquaculture, including the more intensive resource‐demanding systems, the use of economic tools embracing wider measurements of social and environmental costs and benefits might provide different and possibly more critical perspectives. However, although these techniques hold promise for such analyses, their development and application in sectors such as aquaculture are as yet limited. This paper reviews the relevant issues, considers the tools and applications of environmental economics and proposes ways in which these may be more effectively be applied ...

AB  - In estimating productivity change over time, technical change is frequently miscalculated as the geometric average of technological changes between two periods based on firm-specific information in the dataset. However, the frontier shift over time is a global phenomenon linked to relative technological progress or regress across the entire frontiers. In this paper, we fill this gap by determining the technical change using synthetic observations generated at random within a unit hypercube and calculating the distances between them and the two frontiers being evaluated. Accordingly, we propose a decomposition of the Malmquist index's traditional technical change into two components: average global technical change, which is shared by all production units, and local technical change, which captures how each firm experiences global technical change. In this way, our approach establishes a new research avenue in production economics based on using randomly generated virtual points to assess overall phenomena.

AB  - <i>Yersinia ruckeri</i> is the cause of hemorrhagic septicemia, known as enteric redmouth disease, in salmonid fish species. This bacterial pathogen can form biofilms on abiotic surfaces of aquaculture settings or even on the surfaces of the fish themselves, contributing to their persistence in the aquatic environment. Detection methods for this and other fish pathogens can be time-consuming and lack specificity and sensitivity, limiting timely monitoring, the treatment of microbial infections, and effective control of their transmission in aquaculture settings. Rapid and sensitive detection methods for nucleic acids can be crucial for an appropriate surveillance of bacterial pathogens, and the CRISPR/Cas-based assays have emerged as a good alternative since it has been proven to be a useful tool for the rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of viruses and some bacteria. In this study, we explored the capability of the CRISPR/Cas13a system (SHERLOCK) to specifically detect both DNA and RNA (gene transcripts) from planktonic and biofilm samples of the bacterial fish pathogen <i>Y. ruckeri</i>. The assay was designed to detect the <i>gyrA</i> gene and the small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) MicA and RprA from planktonic cultures and biofilm samples prepared in marine broth. The specific crRNA designed for these gene targets included a 28 nt specific gene sequence, and a scaffold sequence necessary for Cas13-binding. For all the assays, the nucleic acids obtained from samples were previously subjected to isothermal amplification with the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method and the subsequent T7 transcription of the RPA amplicons. Finally, the detection of nucleic acids of <i>Y. ruckeri</i> was by means of a reporter signal released by the Cas13a collateral RNA cleavage triggered upon target recognition, measured by fluorescence- or lateral-flow-based readouts. This CRISPR/Cas13a-based assay was able to specifically detect both DNA and sRNAs from the <i>Y. ruckeri</i> samples, and the sensitivity was comparable to that obtained with qPCR analysis, highlighting the potential applicability of this CRISPR/Cas13a-based assay for fish pathogen surveillance.

AB  - Sustainable practices meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Applying these concepts to food and feed production, nutritional sustainability is the ability of a food system to provide sufficient energy and essential nutrients required to maintain good health in a population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their nutritional needs. Ecological, social, and economic aspects must be balanced to support the sustainability of the overall food system. The nutritional sustainability of a food system can be influenced by several factors, including the ingredient selection, nutrient composition, digestibility, and consumption rates of a diet. Carbon and water footprints vary greatly among plant- and animal-based ingredients, production strategy, and geographical location. Because the pet food industry is based largely on by-products and is tightly interlinked with livestock production and the human food system, however, it is quite unique with regard to sustainability. Often based on consumer demand rather than nutritional requirements, many commercial pet foods are formulated to provide nutrients in excess of current minimum recommendations, use ingredients that compete directly with the human food system, or are overconsumed by pets, resulting in food wastage and obesity. Pet food professionals have the opportunity to address these challenges and influence the sustainability of pet ownership through product design, manufacturing processes, public education, and policy change. A coordinated effort across the industry that includes ingredient buyers, formulators, and nutritionists may result in a more sustainable pet food system.

AB  - In 2019, it was estimated that more than 50 million captive Atlantic salmon in Norway died in the final stage of their production in marine cages. This mortality represents a significant economic loss for producers and a need to improve welfare for farmed salmon. Single adverse events, such as algal blooms or infectious disease outbreaks, can explain mass mortality in salmon cages. However, little is known about the production, health, or environmental factors that contribute to their baseline mortality during the sea phase. Here we conducted a retrospective study including 1627 Atlantic salmon cohorts put to sea in 2014-2019. We found that sea lice treatments were associated with Atlantic salmon mortality. In particular, the trend towards non-medicinal sea lice treatments, including thermal delousing, increases Atlantic salmon mortality in the same month the treatment is applied. There were differences in mortality among production zones. Stocking month and weight were other important factors, with the lowest mortality in smaller salmon stocked in August-October. Sea surface temperature and salinity also influenced Atlantic salmon mortality. Knowledge of what affects baseline mortality in Norwegian aquaculture can be used as part of syndromic surveillance and to inform salmon producers on farming practices that can reduce mortality.

AB  - While it is possible to define ANT in a series of abstract bullet points to do so is to miss most of the point. Instead it explores and theorises the world through rich case studies. This means that, like symbolic interactionism, for ANT words are never enough: you need to practice it. In this paper we work empirically, drawing on an ANT-inflected ethnography of Norwegian salmon farming, and also dialogically. We do this because we want to show that for ANT theory is created, recreated, explored and tinkered with in particular research practices. Indeed, ANT is probably best understood as a sensibility, a set of empirical interferences in the world, a worldly practice, or a lively craft that cherishes the slow processes of knowing rather than immediately seeking results or closure. In particular it is sensible to materiality, relationality, heterogeneity, and process. At its best it understands itself as working in the world to create analytical contexts; but also on the world, to articulate and press particular contexts and their politics. As a part of this it explores the contingencies of power, generating tools to undo the inevitability of that power, while working on the assumption that other and better worlds are possible.

AB  - Today, the combined direct contribution of fishing and fish farming is about one-third of the Faroe Islands’ GDP. In the last three decades, aquaculture has become an important industry, and the Faroe Islands is now the fifth largest salmon producer in the world. In this article, we provide an analysis of the development of Faroese aquaculture from the early 1960s to the present. As in other countries, there have been periods of growth as well as setbacks, and we analyze the reasons behind these developments. In addition, we will analyze the future prospects for the industry. In recent years, production has leveled off in the Faroe Islands. An important question is whether the industry will be able to respond to the business opportunities presented by the high price of salmon.

AB  - Most research works on the production frontier in aquaculture focus on efficiency measurement using either Stochastic Production Frontier (SPF) or Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The studies on productivity growth in aquaculture were limited, perhaps due to lack of time-series data. Nevertheless, total factor productivity analysis (TFP) in fish farms has started gaining popularity in recent years. In addition, the majority of the efficiency studies have centered on technical efficiency analysis but substantial increases in the output levels can be fully realized through improving overall economic efficiency. Therefore, this review suggests that future research should estimate all three efficiency indices (i.e., technical, allocative and economic efficiencies).

AB  - <jats:p>Food systems account for one third of greenhouse gas emissions while fish production is assigned 4% of total anthropogenic emissions as well as other environmental implications. The Greek fishery industry is a very promising and upcoming sector with renowned products such as “Avgotaracho Mesolongiou”, the Greek bottarga, which is a product of designated origin (PDO) with cultural and economic significance but unexplored environmental impacts. The aim of the study is to depict the environmental hot-spots of “Avgotaracho Mesolongiou” production using the life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology with the help of SimaPro v3.5 software and the Ecoinvent database v3.9. “Avgotaracho Mesolongiou” supply chain is divided into the fish extraction, roe processing and transport, and retail stages, while the inventory of each stage is filled with data depicted from producers via a questionnaire and findings from the literature. The hot-spot analysis of Avgotaracho Mesolongiou exhibited high human carcinogenic toxicity, and marine and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts that account for more than 90% of total normalized scores. More specifically, the use of metallic traps in the fish-catching facilities presented the highest contribution among the inputs and was responsible for more than 70% of total normalized scores. Furthermore, the uncontrolled treatment processes of waste streams are attributed 6% of total normalized scores. More specifically, waste wood open-burning accounts for 10% of human carcinogenic toxicity while disposal of wastewater was responsible for 25% of freshwater eutrophication. Moreover, a scenario-driven LCA was conducted to compare the existing waste treatment meth+ods to a proposed improved waste management (IWM) scenario. The implementation of controlled treatment processes resulted in a decrease in human carcinogenic toxicity and freshwater eutrophication impact by 8% and 26%, respectively. The outcome was proven to be robust in respect to the affected impact categories while the fish extraction remains the most impactful stage of the supply chain when subjected to a sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>

AB  - Chile is the second largest global producer of farmed salmon. The growth of salmon production has not been free of environmental challenges, such as the increasing use of pesticides to control the parasitic load of the sea lice Caligus rogercresseyi. The lack of the specificity of pesticides can potentially affect non-target organisms, as well as the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. The aim of this study, was to understand the effect of pesticides on natural microbial communities to the addition of the anti-lice pesticide azamethiphos, deltamethrin and emamectin benzoate, and their potential impact in ammonium uptake rates in the coast off central-southern Chile and northern Patagonia. The addition of pesticides on natural microbial communities resulted in a rapid response in ammonium uptake, which was significant for the single use of pesticide, azamethiphos and emamectin benzoate, as well as the combination, azamethiphos, deltamethrin and emamectin benzoate. In northern Patagonia, azamethiphos addition produced a 53% decrease in photoautotrophic uptake. However, an increase, although variable, was observed in chemoautotrophic uptake. Emamectin benzoate produced a 36% to 77 % decrease in chemo and photoautotrophic ammonium uptake, respectively. The combined use of pesticides, also produced up to 42% decrease in both photo and chemoautotrophic assimilation. We conclude that the use of pesticides in salmon farming produces diverse responses at the microbial level, stimulating and/or inhibiting microbial communities with subsequent impact on nitrogen budgets. Further studies are necessary to understand the impact of pesticides in the ecology of central-southern and northern Patagonia, Chile.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture is the fastest growing animal protein production system in the world; however, intensive farming leads to poor weight gain, stress, and disease outbreaks. Probiotics offer the potential to enhance growth performance and feed efficiency in Atlantic salmon, as well as immunostimulate fish against common pathogens, benefitting farmers and consumers with more efficient production. Here, we isolated and identified 900 native microbial isolates including 18 Lactobacilli from the farmed salmon intestines. Based on whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the Lactobacillus candidates belonged to Latilactobacillus curvatus (L. curvatus) species and formed two distinct phylogenetic groups. Using bioinformatics and in vitro analyses, we selected two candidates L. curvatus ATCC PTA-127116 and L. curvatus ATCC PTA-127117, which showed desirable safety and probiotic properties. The two L. curvatus candidates were evaluated for safety and efficacy (higher final weight) in Atlantic salmon alongside spore-forming Bacilli isolated from salmon, poultry, and swine. All the tested candidates were safe to salmon with no adverse effects. While we did not see efficacy in any Bacillus supplemented groups, compared to untreated group, the group administered with the two L. curvatus strains consortium in feed for seven weeks in freshwater showed indicators of improvement in final body weight by 4.2%. Similarly, the two L. curvatus candidates were also evaluated for safety and efficacy in Atlantic salmon in saltwater; the group administered with the two L. curvatus strains consortium in feed for 11 weeks showed indicators of improvement in final body weight by 4.7%. Comprehensive metabolomics analyses in the presence of different prebiotics and/or additives identified galactooligosaccharide as a potential prebiotic to enhance the efficacy of two L. curvatus candidates. All together, these data provide comprehensive genomic, phenotypic and metabolomic evidence of safety and desirable probiotic properties as well as indicators of in vivo efficacy of two novel endogenous L. curvatus candidates for potential probiotic applications in Atlantic salmon. The in vivo findings need to be confirmed in larger performance studies, including field trials.

AB  - Facing antibiotic resistance has provoked a continuously growing focus on phage therapy. Although the greatest emphasis has always been placed on phage treatment in humans, behind phage application lies a complex approach that can be usefully adopted by the food industry, from hatcheries and croplands to ready-to-eat products. Such diverse businesses require an efficient method for combating highly pathogenic bacteria since antibiotic resistance concerns every aspect of human life. Despite the vast abundance of phages on Earth, the aquatic environment has been considered their most natural habitat. Water favors multidirectional Brownian motion and increases the possibility of contact between phage particles and their bacterial hosts. As the global production of aquatic organisms has rapidly grown over the past decades, phage treatment of bacterial infections seems to be an obvious and promising solution in this market sector. Pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas and Vibrio, have already proved to be responsible for mass mortalities in aquatic systems, resulting in economic losses. The main objective of this work is to summarize, from a scientific and industry perspective, the recent data regarding phage application in the form of targeted probiotics and therapeutic agents in aquaculture niches.

AB  - <jats:p>The escape of domesticated Atlantic salmon <jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic> from aquaculture facilities represents a continued threat to the genetic and demographic stability of wild salmon stocks. Escaped farm-origin salmon have been shown to hybridize with wild conspecifics, yet the long-term genetic impacts are generally unknown. Theoretically, life history variation, specifically precocial maturation of male hybrids, could fast-track introgression, but evidence for this has been sparse. Here, we used empirical and experimental data to examine the role of precocious male maturation in introgression. We examined hybrid class composition using juvenile sampling and genetic assignment over a 5 yr period following an escape event in southern Newfoundland, a region with high rates of natural male precocial maturation. Initially following the escape, the proportion of first-generation (F1) hybrids was high and then decreased annually, contrasting the proportion of backcross wild individuals, which increased over time. The presence and temporal distribution of backcross wild individuals supports the hypothesis that high rates of precocial maturation can fast-track the long-term impacts of escaped farmed salmon on wild populations via interbreeding. This was experimentally tested using lab-created wild, farmed, and F1 parr released and recaptured from a Newfoundland river to assess levels of precocious male maturation. Observed rates of maturation of F1 hybrids were high and similar to wild parr (77 vs. 73%, respectively), indicating that most F1 hybrids mature precocially. Our results suggest that rates of precocial male maturation should be explicitly considered in risk assessments evaluating the genetic impacts of escaped farmed salmon on wild populations.</jats:p>

AB  - Eutrophication is one of the most common causes of water quality impairment of inland and marine waters. Its best-known manifestations are toxic cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and waterways and proliferations of green macro algae in coastal areas. The term eutrophication is used by both the scientific community and public policy-makers, and therefore has a myriad of definitions. The introduction by the public authorities of regulations to limit eutrophication is a source of tension and debate on the activities identified as contributing or having contributed decisively to these phenomena. Debates on the identification of the driving factors and risk levels of eutrophication, seeking to guide public policies, have led the ministries in charge of the environment and agriculture to ask for a joint scientific appraisal to be conducted on the subject. Four French research institutes were mandated to produce a critical scientific analysis on the latest knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, consequences and predictability of eutrophication phenomena. This paper provides the methodology and the main findings of this two years exercise involving 40 scientific experts.

AB  - The European Arctic is commonly thought of as a pristine and homogeneous area. In reality, it is a diverse region experiencing growth relying on natural resource extraction. Despite local communities being primarily affected by industry activities, most socioeconomic impact assessments are conducted at the macro level. This study addresses this gap by examining the impacts of economic activities on local communities. Using secondary data and semi-structured interviews from 15 hubs in five European Arctic countries, the study draws on locally relevant insights. Findings indicate that many activities focus on economic growth, and existing strategies do not adequately address biophysical boundaries. Furthermore, alternative activities need to be developed in a more balanced manner that aligns with the needs of indigenous and local communities. Finally, participation of various actors in future developments is critical to reduce the negative impacts of industry activities.

AB  - Ulva macroalgae species are recognized to be an underexploited source of key nutrients, including proteins, fibers and minerals. The present work evaluated the nutritional value protein, ash, mineral composition, fat, fatty acid profile and dietary fiber of the green macroalgae Ulva rigida produced in an open land-based integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system, over four seasons. Overall, protein and fat content of the farmed algae ranged between 7.6 and 25.8% DW and between 0.2 and 1.3% DW, respectively, reaching the highest levels during autumn/winter seasons. In turn, total dietary fiber and ashes showed a contrary seasonal tendency, reaching maximum levels in spring (40.9–58.3% DW and 25.5–38.8% DW, respectively). Notably, the latter were particularly characterized by their richness in potassium, magnesium and iron, and a sodium/potassium ratio bellow 1.7. Variable cultivation conditions of stocking density (Sd) and flow rate (Fr) were also tested, allowing to confirm that manipulation of cultivation conditions in an IMTA system may help to improve the nutritional value of this macroalga and to boost its market value through its use as a functional food ingredient.

AB  - Sustainable development poses highly complex issues for those who attempt to implement it. Using the Brundtland Commission’s definition of sustainable development as a vantage point, this article discusses the issues posed by the production of one kind of food, farmed Atlantic salmon, as a means of illustrating the complexity, interconnectedness and highdata requirements involved in assessing whether a given industry is sustainable. These issues are explored using the three commonly accepted aspects of sustainability – its environmental, social and economic aspects – and the dilemmas posed by the need to make the trade-offs necessary among these. It concludes by arguing that decisions of this complexity require complex and multiple decision-making structures and suggests four that are essential for the task.

AB  - Salmon farming is among the most successful aquaculture industries with a production growth that is substantially higher than aggregate aquaculture production in recent decades. It is well known that innovations and productivity growth are the main sources for this development. In this article we look closer at two potentially important factors in production growth, development of farm size and company size directly through economies of scale and indirectly through capacity in R&D, innovation, sales and marketing. In Norway, production per license has increased from 26 tons in 1980 to 1,130 tons in 2010, suggesting a substantial intensification in the industry. In all five leading salmon producing countries, the degree of concentration has increased and the large firms have become bigger over time.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Several studies have demonstrated lower fitness of salmonids born and reared in a hatchery setting compared to those born in nature, yet broad-scale genome-wide genetic differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin fish have remained largely undetected. Recent research efforts have focused on using epigenetic tools to explore the role of heritable changes outside of genetic variation in response to hatchery rearing. We synthesized the results from salmonid studies that have directly compared methylation differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin fish. Overall, the majority of studies found substantial differences in methylation patterns and overlap in functional genomic regions between hatchery-origin and natural-origin fish which have been replicated in parallel across geographical locations. Epigenetic differences were consistently found in the sperm of hatchery-origin versus natural-origin fish along with evidence for maternal effects, providing a potential source of multigenerational transmission. While there were clear epigenetic differences in gametic lines between hatchery-origin and natural-origin fish, only a limited number explored the potential mechanisms explaining these differences. We outline opportunities for epigenetics to inform salmonid breeding and rearing practices and to mitigate for fitness differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin fish. We then provide possible explanations and avenues of future epigenetics research in salmonid supplementation programs, including: 1) further exploration of the factors in early development shaping epigenetic differences, 2) understanding the functional genomic changes that are occurring in response to epigenetic changes, 3) elucidating the relationship between epigenetics, phenotypic variation, and fitness, and 4) determining heritability of epigenetic marks along with persistence of marks across generations.</jats:p>

AB  - European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) is among Europe's top-consumed fish species, but wild stocks fluctuate and change their habitat due to drastic changes in climate (Hamon G. et al., 2019). Their potential in aquaculture is under consideration, and therefore multiple quality aspects have been evaluated in this study. The chemical composition, nutritional profile, and physicochemical properties of European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) from aquaculture and wild origin (Norwegian west-coast) and differences between female and male farmed individuals were studied. Differences between farmed and wild fish were found for the proximate composition, nutritional profile, and physicochemical attributes. Farmed fish generally had paler color (higher L*; 78.7 ± 4.2) but showed reduced water holding capacity (WHC; 80.3 ± 8.1%), but a firmer fillet texture compared to wild plaice. Farmed fish had significantly higher lipid and lower ash contents than wild individuals. Farmed fish's free amino acid (FAA) content (265.6 ± 59.0 mg/ 100 g) was significantly higher than in wild fish (89.72 ± 43.6 mg/ 100 g), especially the taste contributing FAA glutamate, glycine, alanine, and tyrosine. However, large individual varieties in FAA were observed within farmed and wild specimens. Farmed fish's fatty acid (FA) profile reflects the feed's composition. The overall quality of farmed European plaice was comparable to wild individuals with an excellent nutritional profile. Gender comparisons in farmed fish has shown that females were paler (higher L*) and showed higher hue (h) values, lower color saturation (Chroma, C), and yellowness (a*) compared to males. No apparent difference in texture was found, and no correlations between WHC and pH nor WHC and water content were detected between females and males. Farmed male individuals had higher lipid (2.35 ± 1.5%) and protein (16.97 ± 1.1%) concentrations compared to females (1.72 ± 1.1%; 15.52 ± 1.7%). The overall findings of this study are promising to further investigate this species for cultivation as a sustainable food resource.

AB  - This study explores the ecological and economic impacts of interactions between escaped farmed and wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) over generations. An age- and stage-structured bioeconomic model is developed. The biological part of the model includes age-specific life-history traits such as survival rates, fecundity and spawning successes for wild and escaped farmed salmon, as well as their hybrids, while the economic part takes account of use and non-use values of fish stock. The model is simulated under three scenarios using data from the Atlantic salmon fishery and salmon farming in Norway. The social welfare is derived from harvest and wild salmon while the economic benefits of fishing comprise both sea and river fisheries. The results reveal that the wild salmon stock is gradually replaced by salmon with farmed origin, while the total social welfare and economic benefit decline, although not at the same rate as the wild salmon stock.

AB  - Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a primary cause of death in the U.S.; diet is a modifiable risk factor in the prevention and treatment of CVD. Omega-3 fatty acids are one dietary component that may reduce CVD-related risks. While oily fish is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA), enriched foods have been developed as alternatives for those who do not consume fish, for example, n-3 enriched eggs. Despite the health benefits of n-3 FA-rich foods, their production has substantial environmental impacts occurring over their production life cycle. In this study, life cycle assessment was conducted to compare the environmental characteristics of two common n-3 FA dietary sources, salmon and n-3 enriched eggs, and to evaluate the potential effects of increasing the n-3 FA intake from current daily consumption to the recommended amount equivalent to consuming two fatty fish meals per week (i.e., 300 mg of n-3 FA). The product systems included all the main stages of the life cycle from feed production to final disposal. Results showed that although salmon presented higher midpoint (acidification, eutrophication and global warming potentials) and endpoint (disability-adjusted life year) impacts on a mass basis, it was a more sustainable option than n-3 eggs when the n-3 FA concentration was considered. Increasing the n-3 FA intake to fulfill the 300 mg target nearly doubled the associated environmental burdens. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses indicated that both the origin of salmon and supplement source for n-3 enriched eggs had significant effects on their environmental performance. This study can help make recommendations about healthy and sustainable choices of n-3 FA sources in the U.S. diet at reduced environmental costs, allowing the public to understand the associated impacts and take action to improve their eating habits.

AB  - Despite their great importance for human therapy, quinolones are still used in Chilean salmon farming, with flumequine and oxolinic acid currently approved for use in this industry. The aim of this study was to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms conferring low susceptibility or resistance to quinolones among bacteria recovered from Chilean salmon farms. Sixty-five isolates exhibiting resistance, reduced susceptibility, or susceptibility to flumequine recovered from salmon farms were identified by their 16S rRNA genes, detecting a high predominance of species belonging to the Pseudomonas genus (52%). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of flumequine in the absence and presence of the efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide and resistance patterns of isolates were determined by a microdilution broth and disk diffusion assays, respectively, observing MIC values ranging from 0.25 to >64 µg/mL and a high level of multi-resistance (96%), mostly showing resistance to florfenicol and oxytetracycline. Furthermore, mechanisms conferring low susceptibility to quinolones mediated by efflux pump activity, quinolone target mutations, or horizontally acquired resistance genes (qepA, oqxA, aac(6′)-lb-cr, qnr) were investigated. Among isolates exhibiting resistance to flumequine (≥16 µg/mL), the occurrence of chromosomal mutations in target protein GyrA appears to be unusual (three out of 15), contrasting with the high incidence of mutations in GyrB (14 out of 17). Bacterial isolates showing resistance or reduced susceptibility to quinolones mediated by efflux pumps appear to be highly prevalent (49 isolates, 75%), thus suggesting a major role of intrinsic resistance mediated by active efflux.

AB  - Abstract Optimal water quality is vital for the growth of Atlantic salmon aquaculture production. Recent data showed that Atlantic salmon feed intake and growth reduce linearly with increasing water carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, suggesting that even relatively low concentrations may impact fish performance. This study evaluated the molecular and physiological responses of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to long-term CO2 exposure. For this purpose, Atlantic salmon post-smolts (N = 900; 67 ± 8 g) were exposed to six CO2 treatments (5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 40 mg/L) for 12-weeks (RAS phase) followed by non-CO2 exposure for a (

AB  - Abstract The changes in the feed of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) towards a more plant-based diet affect the nutritional value of the fillets. By compiling the contents of a range of nutrients in 1108 samples of Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon collected between 2005 and 2020, we found that the median contents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have decreased by > 60%. However, farmed Atlantic salmon remains a considerable source of EPA and DHA, with one and two portions being sufficient to meet the weekly adequate intake of EPA and DHA for adults (175 g) and two-year-olds (80 g), respectively. Farmed Atlantic salmon also remains a considerable source of protein, selenium, vitamin B12, and vitamin D3. Together, we demonstrate that farmed Atlantic salmon can contribute substantially to the nutrient intake of the consumers. These data are important for the Norwegian food composition table and future risk–benefit assessments on fatty fish consumption.

AB  - Genetic interactions between farmed and wild conspecifics are of special concern in fisheries where large numbers of domesticated individuals are released into the wild. In the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), selective breeding since the 1970's has resulted in rapid genetic changes in commercially important traits, such as a doubling of the growth rate. Each year, farmed salmon escape from net pens, enter rivers, and interbreed with wild salmon. Field experiments demonstrate that genetic introgression may weaken the viability of recipient populations. However, due to the lack of diagnostic genetic markers, little is known about actual rates of gene flow from farmed to wild populations. Here we present a panel of 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that collectively are diagnostic in identifying individual salmon as being farmed or wild, regardless of their populations of origin. These were sourced from a pool of 7000 SNPs comparing historical wild and farmed salmon populations, and were distributed on all but two of the 29 chromosomes. We suggest that the generic differences between farmed and wild salmon at these SNPs have arisen due to domestication. The identified panel of SNPs will permit quantification of gene flow from farmed to wild salmon populations, elucidating one of the most controversial potential impacts of aquaculture. With increasing global interest in aquaculture and increasing pressure on wild populations, results from our study have implications for a wide range of species.

AB  - The culture of certain fish species to sizes at which they can reproduce has led to the escape of fertilised eggs or 'escape through spawning'. To investigate the extent and ecological im- portance of spawning in sea-cages for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (L.), we (1) evaluated the extent, frequency and timing of spawning in cod culture; (2) analysed the quality of eggs released from farms in terms of variation in fatty acids; (3) modelled the distribution of eggs and larvae from a commercial cod culture site; and (4) predicted the post-escape survival of eggs through summarizing existing knowledge on survival rates of different life stages. Collectively, our results indicate that cod farming has the potential to produce large amounts of eggs and larvae through spawning in cages, with numbers of eggs spawned being 4 to 5 times higher in the second than in the first year. Our scenarios suggest that a typical sea-cage with 60 000 fish may produce 1.4 to 21 tons of 3 yr old first generation farmed cod through spawning in sea-cages. The quality of escaped eggs and larvae is likely to be sufficient for larvae to survive until the first feeding, while survival until adulthood, though difficult to predict, may be high under favourable conditions. Sim- ulations indicate that eggs and larvae from farms may mix with those of wild fish during the spawn- ing season, and thus experience comparable larval environments. However, several implementable management measures exist that will diminish the extent of egg escape in future cod farming.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health crisis with attention focussed on food supply as part of the ‘One Health’ integration of veterinary, environmental and public health. Aquaculture has been the fastest growing livestock sector in recent decades and is critical to nutritional security in many low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC). With ready access to antibiotics and limited availability of veterinary support, disease control with antibiotics is poorly informed, often unrecorded and high in many countries where aquaculture growth is fastest. Vaccination of fish in LMIC with locally produced autogenous vaccines against bacterial diseases may provide a locally driven, cost‐effective means of reducing antibiotic use, replicating the successes achieved during the growth of Norway's aquaculture industry. Autogenous vaccines, as part of an informed veterinary health programme, have several advantages in terms of intellectual property, efficacy and flexibility. We consider access to fish vaccines in example countries of high aquaculture importance, including Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. We contrast the success of antimicrobial reduction in Norwegian salmon aquaculture with the high antibiotic use in the Chilean industry where vaccines are available, finding that regulation, planning, husbandry and environmental problems may increase disease incidence and severity. We identify technical, bureaucratic and infrastructural transitions that could facilitate implementation of autogenous vaccination in LMIC aquaculture against challenging socio‐economic and environmental backgrounds. The benefits of autogenous vaccination to animal welfare, transboundary biosecurity, local farmer and industry economics, and to public health, favour implementation in aquaculture as a locally enabled solution to the global problem of antimicrobial resistance.</jats:p>

AB  - There is growing interest in cultivating fish, shellfish, and seaweeds in offshore waters. Existing pilot and commercial facilities demonstrate that offshore aquaculture is technically feasible, and that it can improve growing conditions and farmed animal health under some conditions. Many of the advances that have improved the ecological outcomes of nearshore aquaculture are likely to apply to offshore facilities as well. However, some ecological risks will likely persist in the near term. The vulnerability of offshore farm site infrastructure to weather events and vessel collisions could be similar to nearshore sites and result in escape events, and the farming of finfish will likely require feeds that include fishmeal and fish oil, ingredients derived from finite marine resources, and terrestrial-origin ingredients whose embodied carbon footprint may be high. Moreover, because offshore aquaculture occurs in ecological contexts that differ significantly from nearshore contexts, different kinds of ecological risks may also arise as the sector grows. Existing claims on marine space and conflicts with other uses could result in clustering of farms in favorable sites, posing a risk of cumulative impact. The transport, deployment, operation, and decommissioning of infrastructure associated with offshore farms may also pose ecological risks related to harmful interactions with marine wildlife (e.g., entanglement, vessel strikes, and habitat exclusion). Here we synthesize information on the ecological risks posed by offshore aquaculture and how to mitigate them. We also use this synthesis to identify knowledge gaps to inform the development of a research agenda and effective policies that can allow an offshore aquaculture industry to grow in the federal waters of the United States while minimizing environmental impact.

AB  - Using data from wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar returning to spawn in seven Scottish rivers, we developed a model of fecundity based on individual body size and key developmental traits. We used a novel approach to model selection which maximises predictive accuracy for application to target river stocks to select the best from a suite of Bayesian hierarchical models. This approach aims to ensure the optimal model within the candidate set includes covariates that best predict out-of-sample data to estimate fecundity in areas where no direct observations are available. In addition to body size, the final model included the developmental characteristics of age at smolting and years spent at sea. Using two independent long-term monitoring datasets, the consequences of ignoring these characteristics was revealed by comparing predictions from the best model with models that omitted them.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Gelatinous plankton present a challenge to marine fish aquaculture that remains to be addressed. Shifting plankton distributions, suggested by some to be a result of factors such as climate change and overfishing, appear to be exacerbated by anthropogenic factors linked directly to aquaculture. Fish health can be negatively influenced by exposure to the cnidarian hydrozoan and scyphozoan life stages commonly referred to as “jellyfish”. Impact is particularly pronounced in gill tissue, where three key outcomes of exposure are described; direct traumatic damage, impaired function, and initiation of secondary disease. Cnidarian jellyfish demonstrated to negatively impact fish include Cyanea capillata, Aurelia aurita, and Pelagia noctiluca. Further coelenterates have also been associated with harm to fish, including sessile polyps of species such as Ectopleura larynx. An accurate picture of inshore planktic exposure densities within the coastal environments of aquaculture would aid in understanding cnidarian species of concern, and their impact upon fish health, particularly in gill disease. This information is however presently lacking. This review summarises the available literature regarding the impact of gelatinous plankton on finfish aquaculture, with a focus on cnidarian impact on fish health. Present strategies in monitoring and mitigation are presented, alongside identified critical knowledge gaps.</jats:p>

AB  - of infectious diseases in honey bees, fish, amphibians, bats and birds in the past two decades have coincided with the increasing use of systemic insecticides, notably the neonicotinoids and fipronil. A link between insecticides and such diseases is hypothesised. Firstly, the disease outbreaks started in countries and regions where systemic insecticides were used for the first time, and later they spread to other countries. Secondly, recent evidence of immune suppression in bees and fish caused by neonicotinoids has provided an important clue to understand the sub-lethal impact of these insecticides not only on these organisms, but probably on other wildlife affected by emerging infectious diseases. While this is occurring, environmental authorities in developed countries ignore the calls of apiarists (who are most affected) and do not target neonicotinoids in their regular monitoring schedules. Equally, scientists looking for answers to the problem are unaware of the new threat that systemic insecticides have introduced in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Abstract This paper develops an optimal harvesting model for the wild Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ), where various age classes of the population are included. It is shown that the marginal value–fecundity relationship of the spawning population, comprising young and old fish, is crucial for the optimal fishing composition. If the value–fecundity ratio is higher for the old spawning population, this age-class should be harvested more aggressively than the young spawning population, and vice versa. It is also shown that changes in prices and interest rate have similar as well as different effects than in the standard fishing biomass model. Small changes in the relative price for the harvestable age classes could either increase or reduce the optimal harvest intensity, or have no effect. While a higher interest rate tends to increase fishing, there also exist intervals of the interest rate in which the optimal harvest program is not affected by changes in the interest rate.

AB  - <jats:p>Salmon are among the most important fishery resources and are produced by commercial fisheries, aquaculture, and propagation. The total production of salmon is now 4.6 million tons, among which 22% comes from commercial fishery production and 78% from aquaculture production, which is the fastest growing food production system in the world. Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout are produced by marine and freshwater aquaculture mainly in Norway and Chile, where environmental impacts are intensively investigated. The biomass of Japanese chum salmon increased steadily from 1970 to 1996 because of the successful improvement of propagation systems. However, the return rate of homing adults has decreased sharply, mainly due to recent unpredictable climate change. New trials of Japanese salmon propagation systems are being carried out by using semi-closed recirculating aquaculture systems and orally administering docosahexaenoic acid. </jats:p>

AB  - Farming of Atlantic salmon has grown rapidly from its start in the early 1970s until today, with production approaching two million tonnes. Sea cages are the dominant production system for the on-growing stage of salmon farming. It represents an effective production system with lower investment and running costs than land-based systems. The development and improvement of the sea cage farming system has been one of the most important factors for the growth of the salmon farming industry. However, during recent years certain problems related to their placement in the open marine environment have proved highly challenging, increasing operating costs and impacting on industry public relations. The problems are mainly due to parasites, diseases and escape of fish. In this article, emerging technical solutions for solving those problems are described.

AB  - Aquaculture is the world's fastest growing animal food producing sector. Although its overall performance is very good, it is unevenly spread geographically. In particular, the growth in most EU countries has been stagnating over the past 20 years despite repeated policy initiatives to launch new growth in the industry. The lack of production growth in EU aquaculture is often explained by strict environmental regulation and bureaucracy. In this article, we argue that an additional important element is an industry structure that limits the innovation and use of new technologies. Historically, farms have been small and often co-managed with larger agriculture production. However, to succeed in a market with global competition, technological innovation and sector-wide specialization, it is necessary to continuously increase productivity and induce investments in larger production facilities to take advantage of economies of scale. In Denmark, a structural change was ‘kicked off’ in 2005. In just 6 years, 30% of Danish production in freshwater has been reallocated to larger and more technologically advanced recirculation farms. Labour productivity has increased and the environmental impact per kilo of fish produced has been reduced, improving future prospects for aquaculture in Denmark and Europe.

AB  - –  The suitability of using regional Habitat Quality Index (HQI) models for predicting distributions of juvenile salmon (Salmo salar L.) was examined using data acquired from selected rivers within Quebec, Canada. Regional HQI models were derived by identifying preferences of salmon fry and parr for the habitat properties of flow velocity, water column depth and granulometric index (an index of substrate size) for groups of rivers. These were compared with local HQI models, derived from preferences for habitat properties within individual rivers. Relationships between HQI values and densities of juvenile salmon were established through the use of nonlinear regression. In all cases, the regional HQI models were less effective for explaining distributions of juvenile salmon than local HQI models based on individual rivers. Regional HQI models were relatively ineffective when the habitat characteristics of the river to which they were applied differed greatly from the characteristics of the other rivers within the region. It is inferred that the relationship between the effectiveness of the regional HQI model and the difference in characteristics between individual rivers and those of the region may be used in an a priori determination of whether a regional HQI may be applied effectively to any given river.

Resumen

1. Los modelos de indices de calidad de habitat (HQI) que definen la calidad de un habitat para mantener una poblacion de peces sobre la base de las propiedades fisicas del habitat, pueden ser derivados de datos adquiridos de rios individuales (modelos locales HQI) o de grupos de rios de una region determinada (modelos regionales HQI). Los modelos regionales HQI tienen la ventaja de que pueden ser utilizados para predecir la calidad del habitat en rios dentro de una region donde no haya datos sobre las poblaciones de peces. Este trabajo examina el grado de adecuacion de utilizar modelos regionales HQI para predecir las densidades de peces utilizando datos de distribucion de juveniles de Salmo salar L. y las caracteristicas del habitat de cinco rios de Quebec (Canada): Rios Sainte-Marguerite, Grande Riviere de la Trinite, Saint-Jean, Bec-Scie y Jupiter.



2. Las densidades de juveniles de S. salar y las caracteristicas del habitat de los rios (velocidad del flujo, profundidad de la columna de agua e indice granulometrico) fueron medidas en parcelas de 5 a 20 metros, sobre posiciones seleccionadas a lo largo de los rios. Los modelos locales y regionales HQI fueron derivados de algoritmos que comparan la distribucion de los juveniles con la distribucion de las caracteristicas del habitat. Este algoritmo procesa velocidad, profundidad y indices granulometricos simultaneamente asi que las estimas de HQI no tienen errores debidos a la seleccion preferencial de alguna caracteristica especifica del habitat. Las relaciones entre los valores del HQI y las densidades de juveniles fueron establecidas a traves de regresiones no lineares. Los modelos regionales HQI fueron entonces utilizados para predecir la calidad del habitat en rios especificos. A su vez, estas predicciones fueron comparadas con la calidad del habitat predicha por los modelos locales HQI que habian sido derivados de los rios especificos.



3. Fuera o no el modelo regional o local HQI, una proporcion grande de la variacion en las densidades de juveniles permanecio no explicada. Los modelos regionales HQI fueron menos efectivos para explicar las distribuciones de juveniles de S. salar que los modelos locales HQI basados en rios especificos. La eficiencia de los modelos regionales HQI estuvo inversamente relacionada a la diferencia entre las caracteristicas medias de los rios especificos a los que se aplicaron los modelos y las caracteristicas medias de los rios sobre los que se derivaron los modelos regionales HQI.



4. Inferimos que la relacion entre la eficiencia del modelo regional HQI y la diferencia entre las caracteristicas de los rios especificos y los de las regiones pueden ser utilizados en determinar a priori si un modelo regional HQI puede ser aplicado con eficiencia a un rio especifico.

AB  - A conspicuous part of the parasite fauna of marine fish are ectoparasites, which attach mainly to the fins or gills. The abundant copepods have received much interest due to their negative effects on hosts. However, for many localities the copepod fauna of fish is still poorly known, and we know little about their temporal stability as long-term observations are largely absent. Our study provides the first inventory of ectoparasitic copepods on fish from the western Wadden Sea (North Sea) based on field data from 1968 and 2010 and additional unpublished notes. In total, 47 copepod parasite species have been recorded on 52 fish host species to date. For two copepod species parasitizing the European flounder (Platichthys flesus), a quantitative comparison of infection levels between 1968 and 2010 was possible. Whereas Acanthochondria cornuta did not show a change in the relationship between host size and infection levels, Lepeophtheirus pectoralis shifted towards the infection of smaller hosts, with higher infection levels in 2010 compared to 1968. These differences probably reflect the biology of the species and the observed decrease in abundance and size of flounders during the last decades. The skin-infecting L. pectoralis can probably compensate for dwindling host abundance by infecting smaller fish and increasing its abundance per given host size. In contrast, the gill cavity inhabiting A. cornuta probably faces a spatial constraint (fixed number of gill arches), thus limiting its abundance and setting a minimum for the host size necessary for infections.

AB  - The decline of Pacific salmon populations on the west coast of Canada has been observed for decades. Hatcheries are used as one solution to this issue, however the benefits and detriments of releasing hatchery-grown salmon into the wild are widely debated. We investigated the release and return numbers of Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha , at the Capilano River Hatchery in North Vancouver, British Columbia. This study focuses on: (1) establishing whether or not there is a declining trend in the number of returning Chinook salmon over the past seven years, and (2) deciphering the survival rate of a population of salmon. Data was collected by counting the returning Chinook salmon over 10 trials of one hour each. We calculated daily average as well as the use of the release and return data of previous years at the Capilano River Hatchery. The returning rate of Chinook salmon over the past seven years displayed a declining trend until the input of our data, which may be a result of unaccounted environmental factors, such as river height. The return numbers for the 2010 population of Chinook salmon was less than 1.28% in comparison to the amount of salmon released (98.1%). When comparing 2010-2016 return numbers per year, there was no significant effect on returns (z=0.864, df=6, p=0.3875), but there was a significant effect of both Sea Surface Temperature (SST) (z=2.343, df=6, p=0.0191) and an interaction between year and SST (z=-2.338, df=6, p=0.0194) on return numbers. The benefits of these hatcheries remain unclear and should be further studied.

AB  - <jats:p>Coastline changes in estuarine areas can result from a combination of natural processes such as erosion, sedimentation, and sea-level rise, as well as human activities, including urbanization and infrastructure development. These changes have the potential to affect the local environment, including submarine groundwater discharge, wetlands, and navigation routes. The Yalu River Estuary (YRE), situated on the border between China and North Korea, has been experiencing significant changes in its coastline over recent years. This study aims to investigate the coastline dynamics in the YRE from 2000 to 2020. The study employs Landsat 5/7/8 satellite data and proposes a modified Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to accurately delineate the coast boundary, particularly in areas with extensive tidal flats like the YRE. The research findings indicate that from 2010 to 2020, significant changes occurred in the YRE shoreline, with erosion being the dominant trend. Human activities and alternations in hydrological conditions are important factors affecting the YRE coastline changes, contributing to the formation of distinctive spatiotemporal patterns. An extreme flooding event in the year 2010 also altered the inner estuarine coastline in the YRE, indicating the impact of strong natural drivers. Findings from this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolving coastal environment, considering natural and anthropogenic drivers, and highlight the importance of continuous monitoring in a region of ecological and geopolitical significance.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Dispersal is a ubiquitous ecological process that has been extensively studied in many plants and animals. Anadromous salmonids are an interesting system for examining dispersal, in part because of their well‐known philopatric behaviour, but also because of the conservation challenges related to the dispersal of hatchery‐origin fish. Building on earlier work, we provide an updated systematic review of dispersal and gene flow in anadromous salmonids. In particular, we compared studies on the dispersal of anadromous salmonids from wild and hatchery origins, including studies providing estimates of dispersal rates, observations of dispersal and results from modelling studies. We reviewed 228 studies and found these were unevenly distributed among species, with Atlantic salmon, Chinook salmon and sea trout being well‐represented. Our results showcase considerable variability in estimated dispersal rates within and across studies, which is likely related to the different methodologies, dispersal propensities across species and populations, and spatial extents considered. Overall, our results confirmed a higher tendency of hatchery fish to disperse relative to wild fish, but we also found some variation across species that warrants further study. Moreover, we found that dispersal propensity tended to decline exponentially with distance and that the drivers of dispersal varied considerably among studies. Additionally, we highlight various facets of dispersal captured across this suite of studies, including variation in terminology, methods and metrics for characterising dispersal, and the spatio‐temporal scales considered. Finally, our review revealed that few studies considered, and even fewer assessed, the implications of dispersal for the conservation and management of anadromous salmonids.</jats:p>

AB  - Understanding the ecology of diseases is important to understanding variability in abundance, and therefore management, of marine animals exploited commercially. The blue crab Callinectes sapidus fills a crucial benthic-pelagic niche in Atlantic estuarine ecosystems and supports large commercial fisheries in both North and South America. In the USA, pre-molt blue crabs are typically held in short-term shedding (ecdysis) facilities to produce soft-shell crabs of increased value. However, mortality rates in these facilities are high and commonly associated with the pathogenic C. sapidus reovirus 1 (CsRV1). To assess whether crab mortalities in these facilities might increase CsRV1 prevalence in wild crab populations, tissue sampled from crabs collected over 2 summers either near to or far from shedding facilities using flow-through water systems were tested by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for the presence of CsRV1 RNA. In support of our hypothesis, PCR data identified the probability of detecting CsRV1 in wild crabs sampled close to shedding facilities to be 78% higher than in crabs sampled from far sites. PCR detections were also 61-72% more probable in male crabs and 21% more likely in male and female crabs over the minimum landing size. As the prevalence at which CsRV1 was detected varied within seasons, among locations and between years, blue crab migration and/or population fluctuations appear to also be involved.

AB  - It is known that aquaculture may produce negative environmental effects on marine ecosystems. Southern Chile is one of the most important salmon and mussel-producing areas in the world. Here we assess the ecological status of benthic communities near farming centers in Caucahue Channel, Chiloe, which has been used intensely for salmon and mussel production for 30 years. The macrofauna, sediments and water column were characterized at distances of 5 to 100 m from three salmon and three mussel-producing centers. Information was also obtained from reference sites 500 to 3000 m from these aquaculture farms. The macrofauna and environmental conditions during winter were analyzed using uni- and multivariate analysis and the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) as an indicator of benthic community condition. (i) There is a high degree of spatial dissimilarity in macrofauna and environmental variables among sampling sites and types of environments (far from or near farming centers) and between the northern and southern areas of the channel; (ii) sediment structure (mean grain size and percentage of total organic matter) correlated with the observed dissimilarities in macrofauna communities; and (iii) the level of perturbation according to AMBI was heterogeneous, with sites in the undisturbed/normal range to moderately disturbed/polluted. We found a high spatial dissimilarity in benthic macrofauna and environmental variables among sampling sites, environmental types and between the northern and southern areas of the channel. AMBI and multivariate community-environment analysis are useful tools to define the level of perturbation of a geographic area at different spatial scales, using all the ecological information from each sample and replicates.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Periods of fasting occur for a multitude of reasons in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Feed withdrawal is widely used prior to transport, parasite treatments, preslaughter and for depuration purposes in recirculating aquaculture systems. Voluntary fasting is a coping response when fish have poor health or are exposed to poor farm environments. Owing to increased attention to animal welfare in aquaculture, concerns have been raised regarding ethical issues when farmed fish are subjected to fasting. However, thorough science‐based recommendations for fasting and feed‐withdrawal regimes have been lacking. The purpose of this review is to provide a synthesis of the various causes for fasting in Atlantic salmon aquaculture and evaluate their associated welfare implications so that guidelines for appropriate practices can be formulated. To interpret impacts, we describe biological responses and tolerance limits to fasting in Atlantic salmon and consider adaptations in the wild. Fry and parr are highly sensitive to feed withdrawal. However, post‐smolts and adults are well‐adapted to endure prolonged fasting without experiencing compromised functionality or health. Here, short periods of feed withdrawal prior to operations should therefore not constitute significant welfare concerns. Serious concerns are instead associated with voluntary fasting that may continue for weeks. We emphasize that environmental extremes that exceed appetite impairing thresholds must be avoided. Additionally, farmed fish should not be subjected to practices that lead to chronic stress that induce cessation of appetite. Diseases or parasites that impair appetite should also be mitigated. Fasting is here a symptom rather than a cause for poor welfare.</jats:p>

AB  - Fish health research has focussed almost exclusively to date on disease and the taxonomy of pathogens and parasites. Health is more than merely the absence of disease. By applying concepts adapted from veterinary herd medicine and human population health, a broader concept of fish health emerges. This concept sees health as a capacity rather than a state and deals with the ability of fish to meet their needs for daily living as well as meet our ecological and economic expectations for them. Fundamental obstacles to fish health research lie in problems we have in with studying health and disease under natural conditions. Four main themes for future research are discussed. We first need to create a shared definition of health and to develop and validate useful fish health indices. Second, efforts must be expended on developing representative and reliable methods for surveillance of health and disease under natural and cultured conditions. Third, we need to develop a conception of health and disease that is mulitfactorial in order to identify how environmental, ecological and management changes affect fish health. Finally, it should be a priority to train and support individuals who examine health holistically and collaboratively. Acting on these four themes will allow us to move fish health research from its current role as a reactive science that responds to dramatic events of death, disease and deformity towards a model that avoids all three of those outcomes and promotes health.

AB  - Brazilian beef production is the second largest in the world and it produced 7.5 million tons carcass weight equivalent in 2011. Production systems are pasture-based, having variable production index and level of technology that increase beef cattle yields. Worldwide demand to set reliable environmental criteria for food and feed products has made consumers more conscious regarding the diversity of products, more attentive to its quality and security, and more concerned with the environmental aspects of production. In this context, this study describes the results of a search for scientific literature and government documents in relation to the application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to agricultural products worldwide, as a way to capture state-of-the-art technology in the field and to identify the trends and drivers for labeling and certification requirements in international markets. In order to remain an important food and feed exporter, Brazil needs to make more efforts to adapt the methodologies of LCA and of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) to the peculiarities of the country and to develop a life cycle inventory (LCI) applicable to Brazil’s agricultural systems. No doubt, there is a trend in the market for the demand of differentiated food products that leads to the adoption of institutional food certification procedures which provide information to the consumers concerning the composition quality and the environmental amiability of the food. Following these trends in the dynamic market, the traceability of beef cattle production and LCA was addressed as a way to provide a powerful analytical instrument to evaluate the environmental impacts of beef production and strengthen its sustainability in the Legal Amazon region. The LCA is a complementary 1 Doctoral Thesis in Agribusiness Agroindustrial Production Chain Analysis, Center for Studies and Research in Agribusiness, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil (117p.)

AB  - A reliable growth function is a vital part of deriving the optimal harvesting strategy and production plan for any aquaculture operation. The range of environmental and biological conditions along the Norwegian coast suggests that the growth of farmed salmon will differ from one region to another. We estimate an aggregated regional growth function for three different regions in Norway using monthly data from 2005 to 2011. There is currently some variation for the grow-out period, and Atlantic salmon is raised between 16–24 months to reach weights of 2–8 kg. These results indicate that an increase in sea temperature positively affects the growth in the regions of Northern and Central Norway, while an increase in sea temperatures negatively affect the growth in the Southern region.

AB  - Many parasites are transmitted trophically, whereas others can either succumb to, or escape from, the predators of their hosts. We examined the extent to which larval arrenurid water mites (Arrenurus planus Marshall, 1908 and Arrenurus pollictus Marshall, 1910) parasitizing lestid damselflies (Lestes forcipatus Rambur, 1842 and Lestes disjunctus Selys, 1862) escape from predatory libellulid dragonflies that are consuming their hosts. We hypothesized that the brightly coloured mites would be avoided by feeding dragonflies. However, all partially engorged A. pollictus mites were eaten while their host was being consumed in staged predation trials. In contrast, half of the fully engorged mites detached and therefore escaped consumption. Trials with A. planus mites showed that they detached more readily than their congenerics, which may be due to selection on those temporary pond mites to survive desiccation stress following detachment. The effect of dragonfly predation on transitioning of mites from parasiti...

AB  - Aquaculture is an important industry globally as it remains one of the significant alternatives of animal protein source supplies for humankind. Yet, the progression of this industry is being dampened by the increasing rate of fish mortality, mainly the outbreak of infectious diseases. Consequently, the regress in aquaculture ultimately results in the economy of multiple countries being affected due to the decline of product yields and marketability. By 2025, aquaculture is expected to contribute approximately 57% of fish consumption worldwide. Without a strategic approach to curb infectious diseases, the increasing demands of the aquaculture industry may not be sustainable and hence contributing to the over-fishing of wild fish. Recently, a new holistic approach that utilizes multi-omics platforms including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction. This approach aims to provide a better understanding of how to improve the resistance of host species. However, no comprehensive review has been published on multi-omics strategies in deciphering fish disease etiology and molecular regulation. Most publications have only covered particular omics and no constructive reviews on various omics findings across fish species, particularly on their immune systems, have been described elsewhere. Our previous publication reviewed the integration of omics application for understanding the mechanism of fish immune response due to microbial infection. Hence, this review provides a thorough compilation of current advancements in omics strategies for fish disease management in the aquaculture industry. The discovery of biomarkers in various fish diseases and their potential advancement to complement the recent progress in combatting fish disease is also discussed in this review.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe United States has a small net-pen salmon industry dating back over 40 years and a nascent net-pen industry for other marine fish. The United States net-pen aquaculture sector has improved its resource efficiency in terms of the amount of fish meal and fish oil used in feeds and reduced its environmental impacts in terms of the mass loading and impact of nutrient discharge on the receiving ecosystem, the incidence and treatment of fish diseases, the use of antibiotics, and the number and impact of fish escapes, while increasing production. These changes can be attributed to a combination of advances in science and technology, rising cost of fish meal/oil, improved management, and informed regulatory practices. Net-pen aquaculture has become an efficient food production system. Existing laws and regulations in the United States effectively address most of the potential adverse environmental effects of net-pen aquaculture.

AB  - Aquaculture is a rapidly growing food production technology, but there are significant concerns related to its environmental impact and adverse social effects. We examine aquaculture outcomes in a three pillars of sustainability framework by analyzing data collected using the Aquaculture Performance Indicators. Using this approach, comparable data has been collected for 57 aquaculture systems worldwide on 88 metrics that measure social, economic, or environmental outcomes. We first examine the relationships among the three pillars of sustainability and then analyze performance in the three pillars by technology and species. The results show that economic, social, and environmental outcomes are, on average, mutually reinforced in global aquaculture systems. However, the analysis also shows significant variation in the degree of sustainability in different aquaculture systems, and weak performance of some production systems in some dimensions provides opportunity for innovative policy measures and investment to further align sustainability objectives.

               <jats:p>We report on the data from an extensive monitoring programme for the occurrence of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Norwegian rivers for 25 years. This monitoring started as a 3-year research programme in 1989 and was followed by management authorities to cover the proportional occurrence of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon in rivers during summer and autumn before spawning. Farmed salmon were distinguished from wild salmon by growth patterns in the scales. More than 362 000 salmon were registered by this programme. Here we present the historical data on escaped farmed salmon in catches 1989–2013 and a methodology for calculating averages across summer and autumn capture in rivers, across years and in regions, using weighted and unweighted observations. Catches of escaped farmed salmon show large spatial and temporal variation, with the early 1990s and early 2000s being periods of large influxes of farmed fish. Western Norway and parts of middle and northern Norway have shown particularly high incidences of escaped farmed fish. Because escaped farmed Atlantic salmon are competing and interbreeding with wild Atlantic salmon, as well as increasing the spread of disease-causing agents, they have become a major force driving the abundance and evolution of Atlantic salmon.</jats:p>

AB  - The success of Chilean salmon farming's early cultivation stages is largely facilitated by access to high-quality water, which is provisioned by watersheds dominated by native forests and defined by high precipitation levels. In recent decades, human activities have increasingly affected both attributes. This study analyzed the risk of climate change in 123 watersheds that supply water to land-based salmon farms in south-central Chile (36.5−43°S). The risk was calculated based on exposure (fingerling and smolt production), sensitivity (land cover maps for three time periods), and hazard indicators (four climate change indicators). The results show a disturbing reality: under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), more than 50% of the current fingerling and smolts production would be located in high or very high-risk areas. These projections are the result of both a drier and warmer climate as well as the continued processes of deforestation and fragmentation of native forests, a spatio-temporal combination which could limit the availability and quality of the water needed for optimal aquaculture production. The risk analysis suggests that landscape configuration may be a potential alternative to mitigate the consequences of climate change on Chilean salmon farming. This is particularly important in areas such as south-central Chile, where the current watershed management and/or conservation strategies do not ensure landscapes resilient to projected hydroclimatic changes.

AB  - <jats:p>With the rapid increase in aquaculture production, its role in food safety and nutritional security has become increasingly important, but this has also given rise to environmental problems that cannot be ignored. The largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) has become a widely cultivated and highly economic freshwater farmed species since it was introduced to China in 1983; however, the environmental impacts of its freshwater pond aquaculture process have not yet been elucidated. Here, life cycle assessment (LCA), a decision-making tool that can evaluate and identify environmental issues during production processes, was used to evaluate the environmental performance of the largemouth bass freshwater pond aquaculture process, and a large-scale, commercial company was selected as an example in Hangzhou, China. The results showed that the pond-farming stage and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential (MAETP) had the largest environmental impacts on the entire aquaculture process. An environmental contribution analysis indicated that electricity (48%) and emissions (23%) were two key factors in the seed-rearing stage, and electricity (60%) and feeds (26%) were two main impact contributors in the pond-farming stage. Improvement measures based on emerging technologies in aquaculture were discussed, namely, clean energies, industrial pond farming, and intelligent feeding strategies, to help with decision making for continuous improvement in the environmental performance of largemouth bass pond farming. Moreover, suggestions for further aquaculture LCA studies in China were summarized, as they will provide a useful reference for promoting the development of China’s aquaculture LCA research and the enrichment of the world’s aquaculture life cycle inventory databases.</jats:p>

AB  - To satisfy increasing demands for fish as food, progress must occur towards greater aquaculture productivity whilst retaining the wild and farmed genetic resources that underpin global fish production. We review the main selection methods that have been developed for genetic improvement in aquaculture, and discuss their virtues and shortcomings. Examples of the application of mass, cohort, within family, and combined between-family and within-family selection are given. In addition, we review the manner in which fish genetic resources can be lost at the intra-specific, species and ecosystem levels and discuss options to best prevent this. We illustrate that fundamental principles of genetic management are common in the implementation of both selective breeding and conservation programmes, and should be emphasized in capacity development efforts. We highlight the value of applied genetics approaches for increasing aquaculture productivity and the conservation of fish genetic resources.

AB  - The purpose of the European SENSE project was to define an integral system to assess and communicate the environmental impacts of food products and to develop a web-based tool for Small and Medium size Enterprises (SMEs). The tool has been tested in salmon, beef-and-dairy, and fruit juice production sectors. The SENSE project has evaluated several existing methodologies for environmental impact assessment over the life cycle including also social aspects, in order to deliver a new integral system for the environmental and social assessment of agricultural and aquaculture food products. The system includes a standardization of a data gathering system, a selection of relevant key environmental performance indicators for food supply chains and a common methodology to perform simplified life cycle impact assessment. The results are based on collected information on the use of resources and emissions generated along the supply chain of food or drink products. The main result is a web-based software tool that is based on a summation of the partial impacts of the different steps in food supply chains. In this software, different actors in the supply chain can enter their own data and link them to the data of other companies. The results obtained in the tool could be used for at least six different approaches: (i) environmental impact assessment of the product, (ii) food chain hot spot identification, (iii) comparison of hypothetical or real improvement scenarios, (iv) assessment of the environmental impact development over the years, (v) benchmarking opportunity for the companies, and (vi) a business to business communication strategy. The scientific robustness of the tool has been tested comparing the obtained results with the same analysis with commercial software. The SENSE tool is a simplified tool designed for food and drink SMEs to assess their sustainability on their own. This cannot be fully compared to a complete LCA study. The testing with SMEs showed that they need additional support for filling in the questionnaires correctly and interpret the results. The simplified evaluation of environmental impacts based on a life cycle approach could lead to benefits to SMEs within the food industry. The future application and development of the tool will be focused on adapting the tool to the Product Environmental Footprint initiative requirements and self-assessment opportunities.

AB  - Abstract The land-based production phase in Norwegian Atlantic salmon farming has the past years been extended to include post-smolt for an increasing number of farmers. Post-smolt production can involve introduction of brackish/seawater to a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) that is acclimatized to freshwater for the earlier stages of salmon production. A change from freshwater to seawater shifts the environmental conditions for fish, bacteria and water treatment processes in RAS. Two regimes for salinity increase were studied to evaluate the effects on nitrification functionality, water and gut microbiota and fish performance on land and in the sea cages. A fish group of 200,000 salmon parr were stocked in a brackish water RAS (bRAS) at 3‰ salinity. After the fish had smoltified the group was split in two, one group was kept in bRAS and the other was moved to a RAS operated at 28‰ salinity (sRAS). The bRAS was operated with a gradual increase in salinity from 3 to 26‰ over a period of 28 days, whereafter both groups were moved to two separate sea cages. Bacterial communities of water, biofilter biofilm and fish faeces were characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Nitrification capacity tests at different salinities were performed on biofilter media from bRAS, to evaluate short term robustness to salinity changes. Ordination based on Bray-Curtis similarities showed that in water samples in bRAS, the bacterial communities were stable from 12 to 26‰ salinity increase. The faecal microbiota of the fish showed high inter-individual variation within fish tanks, suggesting stochastic processes/drift to affect the community structures in addition to salinity increase. The same nitrifying bacteria were present in bRAS (throughout the salinity increase) and in sRAS, showing that these nitrifiers could adapt to salinities from 3 to 26‰, and 28‰. After the sea cage phase, fish from the sRAS system had in total 2.9% higher weight than the fish from bRAS, however the mortality was 15% higher in the sRAS group. Salinity was a driver for succession in RAS, and other factors such as organic load in the water and stochastic processes in the host also affected the bacterial community dynamics.

AB  - Wild stocks of Pacific salmonids have experienced sharp declines in abundance over the past century. Consequently, billions of fish are released each year for enhancing abundance and sustaining fisheries. However, the beneficial role of this widely used management practice is highly debated since fitness decrease of hatchery-origin fish in the wild has been documented. Artificial selection in hatcheries has often been invoked as the most likely explanation for reduced fitness, and most studies to date have focused on finding signatures of hatchery-induced selection at the DNA level. We tested an alternative hypothesis, that captive rearing induces epigenetic reprogramming, by comparing genome-wide patterns of methylation and variation at the DNA level in hatchery-reared coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) with those of their wild counterparts in two geographically distant rivers. We found a highly significant proportion of epigenetic variation explained by the rearing environment that was as high as the one explained by the river of origin. The differentially methylated regions show enrichment for biological functions that may affect the capacity of hatchery-born smolts to migrate successfully in the ocean. Shared epigenetic variation between hatchery-reared salmon provides evidence for parallel epigenetic modifications induced by hatchery rearing in the absence of genetic differentiation between hatchery and natural-origin fish for each river. This study highlights epigenetic modifications induced by captive rearing as a potential explanatory mechanism for reduced fitness in hatchery-reared salmon.

AB  - Cultured strains of marine and anadromous species reared for aquaculture can be either inadvertently (as in farm escapes) or deliberately (as in stocking/ ranching) introduced into the wild, where they may interact with wild conspecifics or other species. This chapter concentrates on the potentially detrimental genetic aspects of these interactions, largely in the context of species cultured in Europe but considering general principles, which have worldwide applicability. Most previous experimental work in the area has involved Atlantic salmon, which has the highest production of any finfish produced in Europe. These investigations have shown generally detrimental results for wild salmon populations, when interactions occur with reared strains. The various European species which might be affected by cultured introgressions (the major aquaculture species) are then considered under several headings: genetic composition of cultured strains compared with wild populations; modes of introduction into the wild; direct and indirect genetic interactions with wild populations/species; consequences of such interactions; establishing the severity of effects of wild/reared interactions with different spe- cies, utilising opportunist situations and field experiments; and, methods such as induction of sterility in reared strains to reduce detrimental effects. Relative risks for wild populations of the major aquaculture species are then considered, and general and specific genetic recommendations are presented.

AB  - Farmed fish escape and enter the environment with subsequent effects on wild populations. Reducing escapes requires the ability to trace individuals back to the point of escape, so that escape causes can be identified and technical standards improved. Here, we tested if stable isotope otolith fingerprint marks delivered during routine vaccination could be an accurate, feasible and cost effective marking method, suitable for industrial-scale application. We tested seven stable isotopes, 134Ba, 135Ba, 136Ba, 137Ba, 86Sr, 87Sr and 26Mg, on farmed Atlantic salmon reared in freshwater, in experimental conditions designed to reflect commercial practice. Marking was 100% successful with individual Ba isotopes at concentrations as low as 0.001 µg. g-1 fish and for Sr isotopes at 1 µg. g-1 fish. Our results suggest that 63 unique fingerprint marks can be made at low cost using Ba (0.0002 – 0.02 $US per mark) and Sr (0.46 – 0.82 $US per mark) isotopes. Stable isotope fingerprinting during vaccination is feasible for commercial application if applied at a company level within the world’s largest salmon producing nations. Introducing a mass marking scheme would enable tracing of escapees back to point of origin, which could drive greater compliance, better farm design and improved management practices to reduce escapes.

AB  - Mark and recapture data were collected to estimate the abundance of fall chum salmon Onchorhynchus keta during 2004 in the middle Yukon River, above the Tanana River confluence. Weekly stratum estimates of migrating fall chum salmon were generated for a period of approximately eight weeks between 27 July and 21 September 2004. Fish were captured with a single fish wheel at the marking and recovery sites. Color-coded spaghetti tags were applied to 4,166 fish at the marking site. Throughout the season, 25,265 fish were examined for marks at the recovery site using video recordings. The tag status of 273 (1%) fish could not be determined and 197 (<1%) fish were tagged. Using a Darroch estimator, the estimated abundance of fall chum salmon migrating through the mainstem Yukon River in 2004 was 618,579 (SE 60,714) for the sampling period. Our estimate was 85% greater than the 2004 run reconstruction for fall chum salmon in the upper Yukon River. The run reconstruction included the combined total of tributary escapements (Chandalar, Sheenjek, and Fishing Branch rivers), harvest estimates above the study area, and Canadian border passage estimate of fall chum salmon. The difference between the Rampart-Rapids passage estimate and the run reconstruction may be partially attributed to unexpected biological and hydrologic factors during the 2004 field season.

AB  - ABSTRACTFor an industry’s total competitiveness, it is important how the suppliers perform. In this respect, efficiency improvement in smolt production is highly important for the Norwegian salmon industry. Smolt is one of the key input factors in salmon farming. After feed, it makes up for the highest cost share. The objective of this research was to analyze the efficiency in Norwegian production of juvenile salmonids from 1988–2012. A special interest in this research was to investigate how the age of the firm affects the technological efficiency. This econometric analysis is undertaken in a stochastic cost frontier framework. The results indicate that significant technical inefficiency is present in smolt production, and that there exist productivity differences between regions. Furthermore, there seems to be a learning-by-doing effect in juvenile production because older firms perform slightly better than the new ones with respect to technical efficiency.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As mariculture—the cultivation of aquatic organisms in marine environment—intensifies to meet the demands of sustainable blue growth and national policies, novel ethical challenges will arise. In the context of ethics, primary concerns over aquaculture and mariculture tend to stay within differing value-based perspectives focused on benefits to human and non-human subjects, specifically animal welfare and animal rights. Nonetheless, the burgeoning field of feminist blue humanities provides ethical considerations that extend beyond animal subjects (including humans), often because of its concerns with new materialist, posthumanist, and other relations-based theories. This article examines feminist blue humanities and the contributions it may bring to understanding contemporary and future ethical challenges posed by mariculture and its intensification, especially the cultivation of low-trophic organisms. By offering an overview of feminist blue humanities, this article explores some of its particularities by drawing out three major ethical concerns facing contemporary mariculture, specifically material reconfigurations, radical alteration of the lives of low-trophic species through industrialization and increases in maricultural waste products.</jats:p>

AB  - The culture of salmonids in the marine environment has led to concern regarding eutrophication of the water column and sediment from uneaten feed. This study used measurement of mass loss and change in carbon and nitrogen content of feed to quantify material lost from waste feed as a function of physical and biological variables. A laboratory flume was used to measure changes in cooked-extruded salmon feed pellets as a function of pellet size (6.5 and 12.0 mm in diameter), residence time in seawater (0, 24, 48, 72 and 120 h), and flow speed (0, 9.3 and 22.2 cm s(-1)). The influence of sediment on pellet degradation was also determined. Loss of pellet mass increased with water flow velocity. Smaller pellets eroded faster than larger pellets, losing 32% (6.5 mm) and 21% (12.0 mm) of their mass after 120 h in seawater. The presence of sediment during preconditioning increased the percentage mass loss of the small pellets only. The presence of sediment also resulted in a greater percentage loss of carbon, but not nitrogen, relative to non-sediment samples. These results allow quantitative assessment of the dynamics of feed pellets in the marine environment with respect to prediction of impact from salmon culture.

AB  - Aulacomya atra is an active suspension feeder, spatially dominant in the shallow-water hard-bottom benthic communities of the Chilean Patagonia fjords. In this region, the vertical flux of autochthonous organic matter (OM) reaching the benthos is augmented by allochthonous OM both from a terrestrial origin and from intensive salmon farming. This mixed pool of OM represents a potential source of food for a variety of benthic consumers, but to date little is known about the degree of utilization of these materials by filter feeders organisms. In this context, we conducted feeding experiments on A. atra in Puyuhuapi Fjord, Chilean Patagonia, during summer and winter 2018–2019. These experiments were designed to determine ingestion rates (IR) of A. atra fed with autochthonous (bacterial and microplanktonic community) and allochthonous (salmon food pellet) OM. Additionally, tissue samples of A. atra were taken for stable isotope analysis. Data indicated that A. atra can feed on both autochthonous and allochthonous OM, but higher IR were detected in individuals fed with salmon food pellets. We were unable to determine diet preferences because the IR is sensitive to food particle density rather than specific type of food. Stable isotope analyses indicate that A. atra preferentially exploits food with an isotopic signal corresponding to autochthonous OM, highlighting the primary role of phytoplankton carbon in their diet. Extensive utilization of terrestrially derived OM is therefore unlikely, although utilization of OM derived from salmon farming is not precluded because of the overlap in isotopic signal between food pellets and marine plankton.

AB  - Knowledge of the prevalence of escaped farmed fishes in the wild is an essential first step to assessing the risk resulting from interactions between farmed and wild fishes. This is especially important in eastern North America, where Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture occurs near wild Atlantic salmon rivers and where many wild salmon popula- tions are severely depressed. Here, we review the literature on the incidence of escaped farmed salmon in eastern North American rivers, for which there has been no comprehensive compilation to date. Escaped farmed salmon have been found in 54 of 62 (87%) rivers investigated within a 300 km radius of the aquaculture industry since 1984, including 11 rivers that contain endangered salmon populations. Averaged among all investigations, the proportional representation of farmed salmon among adults entering the rivers from the sea was 9.2% (range 0% to 100%). Where data were sufficient to exam- ine temporal trends, farmed salmon proportions varied considerably over time, suggesting that escape events are episodic in nature. We conclude that escaped farmed salmon are sufficiently prevalent in eastern North American rivers to pose a potentially serious risk to the persistence of wild salmon populations, especially in those rivers that are adjacent to existing aquaculture sites.

AB  - Bacterial diseases are important factors that limit productivity in aquaculture. To reduce negative economic impacts, fish farmers use antimicrobials, often indiscriminately, and this action has led to bacterial resistance to drugs. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify the main putative pathogenic bacterial species in tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), establish the profile of resistance to antimicrobials by the methods of disc diffusion, and determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Two hundred and ninety asymptomatic fish were collected between March and November 2015 from ten fish farms in the Amazonas state (Brazil). Of the total strains recovered from tambaqui, seven were identified as Aeromonas spp. by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. These seven isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, 28% to erythromycin, and 28% to sulfonamide. Additionally, the seven isolates showed a MIC higher than the range evaluated for amoxicillin, penicillin, novobiocin, tylosin tartrate, and clindamycin, and 85% showed resistance to erythromycin. The results of this study indicate the need to increase the awareness of fish farmers and, most importantly, the government, about the lack of drug regulations for use in aquaculture, and good management practices, so the indiscriminate prophylactic and systemic use of antimicrobials be inhibited.

AB  - Rather than benefiting wild fish, industrial aquaculture may contribute to declines in ocean fisheries and ecosystems. Farm salmon are commonly infected with salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which are native ectoparasitic copepods. We show that recurrent louse infestations of wild juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), all associated with salmon farms, have depressed wild pink salmon populations and placed them on a trajectory toward rapid local extinction. The louse-induced mortality of pink salmon is commonly over 80% and exceeds previous fishing mortality. If outbreaks continue, then local extinction is certain, and a 99% collapse in pink salmon population abundance is expected in four salmon generations. These results suggest that salmon farms can cause parasite outbreaks that erode the capacity of a coastal ecosystem to support wild salmon populations.

AB  - The dynamics of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) was studied in mariculture areas around Bolinao and Anda, Philippines to examine its possible link to recurring algal blooms, hypoxia and fish kills. They occur despite regulation on number of fish farm structures in Bolinao to improve water quality after 2002, following a massive fish kill in the area. Based on spatiotemporal surveys, coastal waters remained eutrophic a decade after imposing regulation, primarily due to decomposition of uneaten and undigested feeds, and fish excretions. Relative to Redfield ratio (16), these materials are enriched in P, resulting in low N/P ratios (~6.6) of regenerated nutrients. Dissolved inorganic P (DIP) in the water reached 4μM during the dry season, likely exacerbated by increase in fish farm structures in Anda. DIP enrichment created an N-limited condition that is highly susceptible to sporadic algal blooms whenever N is supplied from freshwater during the wet season.

AB  - To evaluate the spatio–temporal distribution and ecological impacts of escaped farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), it is necessary that escapees can be traced in the wild. To do this, simple, reliable, and fast methods for determining the origin of cod are required. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate whether simple analyses of scales and body morphology can distinguish between wild and farmed cod. Digital images of fish and scales from adult cod from two farms, and wild cod caught near these farms, were analysed by computer-based image analyses. By combining mean breadth of circuli and length-adjusted scale radius in a discriminant analysis, 86 and 80% of wild and farmed fish, respectively, were correctly classified. Moreover, using three simple morphometric measures representing dorsal fin size, neck curvature, and length of lower jaw, 100 and 95% of wild and farmed cod, respectively, were classified correctly. To validate these discrimination methods further, an expanded analysis of additional farmed and wild cod populations is required. The results pave the way for the development of a reliable and standardized methodology for classification of the origin of cod caught in the wild.

AB  - The paper offers a review and commentary, with particular reference to the production of fish from wild capture fisheries and aquaculture, on neglected aspects of health impact assessments which are viewed by a range of international and national health bodies and development agencies as valuable and necessary project tools. Assessments sometimes include environmental health impact assessments but rarely include specific occupational health and safety impact assessments especially integrated into a wider public health assessment. This is in contrast to the extensive application of environmental impact assessments to fishing and the comparatively large body of research now generated on the public health effects of eating fish. The value of expanding and applying the broader assessments would be considerable because in 2004 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports there were 41,408,000 people in the total ‘fishing’ sector including 11,289,000 in aquaculture. The paper explores some of the complex interactions that occur with regard to fishing activities and proposes the wider adoption of health impact assessment tools in these neglected sectors through an integrated public health impact assessment tool.

AB  - As the second biggest producer of salmon after Norway, Chile is one of the leading forces of aquaculture with a long history of being strongly focused on international markets. Based on contributions from critical geography, political ecology and the sociology of globalization, the article analyses the dominant narratives and policies deployed by the Chilean government and the salmon farming industry in successive contexts of boom and crisis of production activity in the archipelago of Chiloé (Los Lagos Region). In a context of a word-wide growing interest in the capabilities of the blue economy, a discourse analysis of governmental, industrial, and public-private institutional documents, together with semi-structured interviews to a broad number of stakeholders contributes to advance the understanding of and learn from the evolution and challenges faced by one the longest world's salmon aquaculture leaders. The research identifies five discursive and policies phases over more than four decades of development. From an initial narrative that defines the region as "empty" and uses the discourse on salmon farming to justify territorial integration policies (1973–1982); to a second period in which the fostering of the salmon farming in the southern region served as a catalyst of national economic growth interests (1983–1994). It follows a boom phase characterized by the capitalization on the blue revolution discourse (1995–2006), which lasted until the territorial crisis resulting from the ISA virus, and the expansion of the industry towards southern regions (2007–2015). The analysis reveals a fifth phase starting in 2016 and ongoing by 2023, which characterized by the emergency and implementation of a new administrative right over coastal-marine areas to safeguard the traditional uses of indigenous communities, starts to challenge the long-standing hegemony of the salmon farming industry in Chile.

AB  - To meet the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 on marine biodiversity protection and Aichi Target 6 on sustainable fisheries by 2020, as well as the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 on food security and SDG 14 on oceans by 2030, there is an urgent need to rethink how best to reconcile nature conservation and sustainable development.
This paper argues for effective governance to support processes that apply principles of sustainable development and an ecosystem approach to decide about economic activities at sea such as aquaculture. It describes opportunities, benefits and synergies between aquaculture and MPAs as a basis for wider debate. The scope is not a comprehensive analysis of aquaculture and MPAs, but rather to present examples of positive interactions between aquaculture activities and MPAs. The unintended negative consequences are also discussed to present balanced arguments.
This work draws from four workshops held in 2015 and 2016 and used to collect information from about 100 experts representing various sectors and perspectives.
It is recognized that aquaculture is an important activity in terms of sustainable development. It can play a role in providing food security, poverty alleviation and economic resilience, in particular for MPA local communities, and contribute to wild stock enhancement, as an alternative to overfishing and for providing services to the ecosystem.
This study showed that there is a need from both aquaculture and MPA sides for clarity of objectives and willingness for open and extensive dialogue. The paper concludes by describing a number of tools and methods for supporting greater synergies between aquaculture and MPAs.
The results from this work have already helped to build a common understanding between conservation and aquaculture and initiate a rapprochement for increasing synergies.

AB  - Evolution by natural selection relies on genetic variation in a population. According to the hologenome concept of evolution, genetic variation can arise from changes in both the host and the symbiotic microbiota genomes. In addition to mutation, holobionts give rise to several underappreciated mechanisms of variation, including acquisition of novel microbes from the environment, amplification, and reduction of specific microbiota, and horizontal gene transfer (between microbes and between microbes and host). Variations in symbiotic microbiota may allow the holobiont to adapt and survive under rapidly changing environmental conditions, thus providing the time necessary for the host genome to evolve. In addition to constructing new genes by mutations, animals and plants have the potential to acquire pre-evolved genetic information and functions from microorganisms, including viruses, either by horizontal gene transfer of microbial genes into the host genome, or by acquisition of novel microbes from the environment into the microbiome. The hologenome concept of genetic variation by acquisition of novel microbes and amplification contains Lamarckian aspects within a Darwinian framework.

AB  - <jats:p>Hatchery release of rock bream (<jats:italic>Oplegnathus fasciatus</jats:italic>) is common in the Zhoushan Sea region of the East China Sea as an efficient method for stock enhancement. Clarifying the genetic effects of farm‐raised populations on wild ones is important for understanding the health of fish stocks. Thus, this study collected six rock bream stocks (two wild, three hatchery‐reared, and one parental) for genetic diversity analysis using microsatellite markers and mitochondrial sequences. Although the results of mitochondrial sequence analysis showed that 61.26% of the genetic diversity resided among groups, indicating a high degree of genetic differentiation among wild, hatchery‐reared, and parental groups, the results of microsatellite analysis showed that 30% of the genetic diversity resided within the populations, indicating no obvious genetic differentiation among different groups. Our study suggests that though releasing hatchery‐reared rock bream for stock enhancement may not noticeably decrease the genetic diversity of wild populations in the Zhoushan Sea in the short term, long‐term genetic evaluations shall be taken to monitor genetic diversity in wild rock bream and ensure that the populations remain healthy.</jats:p>

AB  - ABSTRACT We measure demand growth for all salmon-importing regions of the world using an index approach for the 2002–2011 period. Our results demonstrate that there are substantial variations in demand growth by region and over time. Russia and Brazil exhibit the highest demand growth, with average annual growth rates of approximately 20%. More established markets, such as the United States and Japan, demonstrate the lowest annual demand growth, at approximately 3%. During the sample period, the average annual rate of aggregated global demand growth is approximately 9%, whereas total global demand growth is approximately 94%. JEL Codes: D12, Q22.

AB  - Mediterranean fish farming has grown exponentially during the last 20 years. Although there is little evidence of the impact on the trophy status around fish farms, there are concerns that the release of solute wastes from aquaculture might affect larger scales in the ecosystem by changing the nutrient load. After combining information from various sources on waste production and on nutrient loads, it was concluded that the overall N and P waste from fish farms in the Mediterranean represents less than 5% of the total annual anthropogenic discharge, and the overall annual increase in P and N pools in the Mediterranean, under a production rate of 150000 tons, is less than 0.01%. The proportion of fish farming discharged nutrients was slightly higher in the eastern Mediterranean. A simple model was used to assess the long-term effects of nutrients released from various sources taking into account the water renewal rate in the Mediterranean. We conclude that, in the long term, fish farm waste could cause a 1% increase in nutrient concentrations in contrast to other anthropogenic activities which might double the Mediterranean nutrient pool.

AB  - Fishing vessels were recently found to be the largest source of black carbon ship emissions in the Arctic, suggesting that the fishing sector should be a focus for future studies. Here we developed a global and Arctic emissions inventory for fishing vessel emissions of short-lived and long-lived climate forcers based on data from a wide range of vessel sizes, fuel sulfur contents, engine types, and operational characteristics. We found that previous work generally underestimated emissions of short-lived climate forcers due to a failure to account for small fishing vessels as well as variability in emission factors. In particular, global black carbon emissions were underestimated by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, our order of magnitude estimate of the net climate effect from these fishing vessel emissions suggests that short-lived climate forcing may be particularly important in regions where fuel has a low sulfur content. These results have implications for proposed maritime policies and provide a foundation for future climate simulations to forecast climate change impacts in the Arctic.

AB  - <jats:p>In 2017, the Chilean government through the Chilean Economic Development Agency (CORFO) (an agency under the Ministry of Economy) launched a public call for the execution of a Technological Program to adopt, adapt, and/or developing enabling technologies for the development of Ocean Aquaculture in places with high-energy (strong waves, winds and/or currents). The consortium of companies, technology centers, and universities led by Ecosea Farming (Ecosea), focused its efforts on aspects related to structural engineering, mooring systems, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), and other integral components, as well as essential aspects of regulation and standards. On this last topic, intensive collaborative work was carried out between the technical teams of the Andrés Bello University, the Undersecretariat of Fisheries and Aquaculture (Subpesca), the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (Sernapesca), and CORFO, with the aim of gathering relevant information from international experience, and establishing the main differences between aquaculture traditionally developed in the fjords, coast, estuaries, and inland sea of southern Chile and aquaculture in the high seas – a practice not yet clearly defined and still indistinctly known as offshore or open ocean aquaculture. This document summarizes the main findings obtained and can be a useful guide for future experiences in other countries with important aquaculture developments.</jats:p>

AB  - SUMMARY 1. Molecular genetic techniques have been used in freshwater biology for more than 30 years. Early work focussed on studies of population structure, systematics and taxonomy. More recently, the range of studies has broadened to include ecology and adaptation. Advances in analytical methods and in technology (e.g. next-generation sequencing) and decreasing costs of data production ensure that the field will continue to develop and broaden in scope. 2. At least three factors make the application of molecular techniques to freshwater biology exciting. First, the highly variable nature of many aquatic habitats makes them excellent models for the study of environmental change on ecological and evolutionary time scales. Second, the mature state of the field of freshwater biology provides an extensive foundation of ecological knowledge of freshwater organisms and their distinct adaptations. Third, the methodological advances allow researchers to focus more on merging molecular and ecological research and less on designing studies around technical limitations. 3. We identified eight research areas in freshwater biology in which the integration of molecular and ecological approaches provides exceptional opportunities. The list is not exhaustive, but considers a broad range of topics and spans the continuum from basic to applied research. The areas identified use a combination of natural, experimental and in silico approaches. 4. With advancing molecular techniques, freshwater biology is in an unusually strong position to link the genetic basis and ecological importance of adaptations across a wide range of taxa, ecosystems and spatiotemporal scales. Our aim was to identify opportunities for the integration of molecular and ecological approaches, to motivate greater collaboration and crossover, and to promote exploitation of the synergies of bridging ecological and evolutionary freshwater research.

AB  - <jats:p>The heterogeneous and homogeneous growth (HmG) assumptions in an intensive tilapia Oreochromis niloticus pre-grow-out production were evaluated under the different stocking scenarios. Four growth models (von Bertalanffy, Logistic, Pütter, and Gompertz) were tested and modified to include the effect of stocking density and growth difference. Models with homogeneous growth were fitted using a nonlinear regression, while heterogeneous growth (HtG) models were parameterized using quantile (0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95) regression. According to goodness of fit and validation, the models that best fit homogeneous and HtG were Logistic and von Bertalanffy, respectively, which confirm the existence of the dense dependency effect on growth performance. Density and growth have an inversely proportional relationship. Quantile regression provided greater efficiency in predicting growth of the different groups of individuals in the population. The results obtained can be used by the aquaculture farmer to select stocking management strategies and optimal transfer time for tilapia juveniles.</jats:p>

AB  - The objective of this paper is to assess the attitude of Malaysian stakeholders to genetically modified (GM) salmon and to identify the factors that influence their acceptance of GM salmon using a structural equation model. A survey was carried out on 434 representatives from various stakeholder groups in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia. Public attitude towards GM salmon was measured using self-developed questionnaires with seven-point Likert scales. The findings of this study have confirmed that public attitudes towards GM salmon is a complex issue and should be seen as a multi-faceted process. The most important direct predictors for the encouragement of GM salmon are the specific application-linked perceptions about religious acceptability of GM salmon followed by perceived risks and benefits, familiarity, and general promise of modern biotechnology. Encouragement of GM salmon also involves the interplay among other factors such as general concerns of biotechnology, threatening the natural order of things, the need for labeling, the need for patenting, confidence in regulation, and societal values. The research findings can serve as a database that will be useful for understanding the social construct of public attitude towards GM foods in a developing country.

AB  - From 1985 to 1988, the Saguling and Cirata hydropower reservoirs in the highlands of West Java, Indonesia, displaced more than 40,000 families. As part of a comprehensive resettlement plan, an attempt to resettle 3,000 families in water-based f loating fish cage aquaculture and land-based aquaculture sup port was initiated. Although the reservoir cage aquaculture developments were successful from a fish-production viewpoint, since 1944 cage aquaculture has not been socially or environmentally sustainable. Fish cage aquaculture in reservoirs can be an important new means ofpopulation resettlement from hy dropower dam construction and protein production in tropical developing countries only with adequate government planning for fisheries; adequate fi nancial compensation for lost assets; rigid enforcement of institutional regula tions guaranteeing the long-term benefits of the new lakes for the exclusive use of the displaced people; enforcement of regulations on cage numbers to prevent environmental degrada...

It also aims to present the main lessons for our current and future understanding of fish in estuaries. There is a focus on developing an understanding of the socioecological system by considering the relationship between the organisms and their environment, and fish tolerance of environmental master factors. It covers the current ideas on ecosystem structure and functioning, such as growth, productivity, competitive interactions and predator-prey relationships. A knowledge of these then leads to an understanding of the estuarine ecosystem services, for example the delivery of fish which can be exploited and ensuring clean water and nutrient and carbon cycling. These services in turn lead to the creation and exploitation of estuarine goods and benefits. Fish and Fisheries in Estuaries: A Global Perspective RelatedInformation

AB  - Qatar is one of the countries with the highest carbon (C) footprints per capita in the world with an increasing population and food demand. Furthermore, the international blockade by some countries that is affecting Qatar—which has been traditionally a highly-dependent country on food imports—since 2017 has led the authorities to take the decision of increasing food self-sufficiency. In this study we have assessed the effect on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of shifting diets from conventional to organic products and from import-based diets to more regionalized diets for the first time in a Gulf country. We found that considering the production system, the majority of the emissions come from the animal products, but the differences between conventional and organic diets are very small (738 and 722 kg CO2-eq capita−1 year−1, of total emissions, respectively). Conversely, total emissions from plant-based products consumption might be around one order of magnitude smaller, but the differences in the emissions between the organic and conventional systems were higher than those estimated for animal products, leading to a decrease in 44 kg CO2-eq capita−1 year−1 when changing from 100% conventional to 50% of organic consumption of plant-based products. Regarding the shift to regionalized diets, we found that packaging has a small influence on the total amount of GHG emissions, whereas emissions from transportation would be reduced in around 450 kg CO2 capita−1 year−1 when reducing imports from 100 to 50%. However, these results must be read carefully. Due to the extreme adverse pedoclimatic conditions of the country, commercial organic regional livestock would not be possible without emitting very high GHG emissions and just only some traditional livestock species may be farmed in a climate-friendly way. On the other hand, organic and regional low-CO2 emission systems of plant-based products would be possible by implementing innovations in irrigation or other innovations whose GHG emissions must be further studied in the future. Therefore, we conclude that shifting towards more plant-based organic regional consumption by using climate-friendly irrigation is a suitable solution to both increasing self-sufficiency and reducing C footprint. We encourage national authorities to including these outcomes into their environmental and food security policies.

AB  - Microalgal bloom events can cause major ecosystem disturbances, devastate local marine economies, and endanger public health. Therefore, detecting and monitoring harmful microalgal taxa is essential to ensure effective risk management in waterways used for fisheries, aquaculture, recreational activity, and shipping. To fully understand the current status and future direction of algal bloom distributions, we need to know how populations and ecosystems have changed over time. This baseline knowledge is critical for predicting ecosystem responses to future anthropogenic change and will assist in the future management of coastal ecosystems. We explore a NGS metabarcoding approach to rapidly identify potentially harmful microalgal taxa in 63 historic and modern Australian marine port and ballast tank sediment samples. The results provide a record of past microalgal distribution and important baseline data that can be used to assess the efficacy of shipping guidelines, nutrient pollution mitigation, and predict the impact of climate change. Critically, eDNA surveys of archived sediments were able to detect harmful algal taxa that do not produce microscopic fossils, such as Chattonella, Heterosigma, Karlodinium, and Noctiluca. Our data suggest a potential increase in Australian harmful microalgal taxa over the past 30 years, and confirm ship ballast tanks as key dispersal vectors. These molecular mapping tools will assist in the creation of policies aimed at reducing the global increase and spread of harmful algal taxa and help prevent economic and public‐health problems caused by harmful algal blooms.

AB  - The worldwide growth of aquaculture has been accompanied by a rapid increase in therapeutic and prophylactic usage of antimicrobials including those important in human therapeutics. Approximately 80% of antimicrobials used in aquaculture enter the environment with their activity intact where they select for bacteria whose resistance arises from mutations or more importantly, from mobile genetic elements containing multiple resistance determinants transmissible to other bacteria. Such selection alters biodiversity in aquatic environments and the normal flora of fish and shellfish. The commonality of the mobilome (the total of all mobile genetic elements in a genome) between aquatic and terrestrial bacteria together with the presence of residual antimicrobials, biofilms, and high concentrations of bacteriophages where the aquatic environment may also be contaminated with pathogens of human and animal origin can stimulate exchange of genetic information between aquatic and terrestrial bacteria. Several recently found genetic elements and resistance determinants for quinolones, tetracyclines, and β-lactamases are shared between aquatic bacteria, fish pathogens, and human pathogens, and appear to have originated in aquatic bacteria. Excessive use of antimicrobials in aquaculture can thus potentially negatively impact animal and human health as well as the aquatic environment and should be better assessed and regulated.

AB  - Salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) is a contagious disease caused by Piscirickettsia salmonis, an intracellular bacterium. SRS causes an estimated economic loss of $700 million USD to the Chilean industry annually. Vaccination and antibiotic therapy are the primary prophylactic and control measures used against SRS. Unfortunately, commercially available SRS vaccines have not been shown to have a significant effect on reducing mortality. Most vaccines contain whole inactivated bacteria which results in decreased efficacy due to the limited ability of the vaccine to evoke a cellular mediated immune response that can eliminate the pathogen or infected cells. In addition, SRS vaccine efficacy has been evaluated primarily with Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon). Vaccine studies using Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) are scarce, despite SRS being the leading cause of infectious death for this species. In this study, we evaluate an injectable vaccine based on P. salmonis proteoliposome; describing the vaccine security profile, capacity to induce specific anti-P. salmonis IgM and gene expression of immune markers related to T CD8 cell-mediated immunity. Efficacy was determined by experimental challenge with P. salmonis intraperitoneally. Our findings indicate that a P. salmonis proteoliposome-based vaccine is able to protect O. mykiss against challenge with a P. salmonis Chilean isolate and causes a specific antibody response. The transcriptional profile suggests that the vaccine is capable of inducing cellular immunity. This study provides new insights into O. mykiss protection and the immune response induced by a P. salmonis proteoliposome-based vaccine.

AB  - Since the 1980s, aquaculture has developed rapidly around the world, outpacing all other sources of animal protein production. Chile is the largest producer in South America, with an export-driven aquaculture industry. Aquaculture development in Chile has largely focussed on three high-value species (Atlantic salmon, Rainbow trout and Chilean blue mussel). These three species accounted for over 90% of the volume and value of Chilean exports by 2014. The paper considers the role of trade and markets on Atlantic salmon production in Chile and the role of government regulators and industry to facilitate a further sustainable increase in farmed salmon output. Specifically, we address the opportunities and constraints regarding the impact of trade and markets for further industry expansion. We find that production constraints (e.g. regulation, over-production), marketing constraints (e.g. consumer perception) and environmental constraints (e.g. disease) have led to stagnating and sometimes declining production, preventing Chile from surpassing Norway and becoming the world’s largest Atlantic salmon producer. The paper concludes that the signs for further growth are positive in Chile, although to date, it is noted that industry expansion has outpaced developments in infrastructure, regulation and research and development. Most significantly, the industry has been blighted with environmental problems, which has weakened market share in recent years. However, better regulatory practice in Chile in recent years has been seen as positive in international markets. We note that further development in the regulatory framework and continued aspirations to meet certification standards (e.g. Aquaculture Stewardship Council, Global Aquaculture Alliance Certification) could lead to increased market share for Chilean farmed salmon in the future.

AB  - The super-intensive white shrimp system is more productive (t ha−1) than traditional systems. However, it implies greater investment in infrastructure and machinery, a continuous supply of electricity, and a specialized workforce. Therefore, the sustainability of a shrimp farm model operating in a super-intensive system in Nayarit (Mexico) was evaluated using financial analysis and life cycle assessment. The investment is important, but the fixed costs (16%) are much lower than variable costs (84%). The super-intensive farm is economically viable, with an overall profitability (29%) that is higher than that of other agri-food activities in Mexico. It is also an activity that generates a lot of employment, in relative terms, as well as economic movement in the area. The potential environmental impacts are higher than those registered in semi-intensive shrimp systems but slightly lower than those registered in intensive systems. The estimated global warming value per kg of shrimp is 5.08 kg CO2-eq, an intermediate value. Also, as the shrimp production is much higher than in traditional systems, it could have a great and positive impact on the maintenance and regeneration of the mangrove ecosystem.

AB  - Stock enhancement is a management tool used for fishery recovery worldwide, yet the success of many stocking programs remains unquantified. Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) and golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) are important Australian recreational target species that have experienced widespread decline. Stocking of these species has been undertaken for decades, with limited assessment of effectiveness. A batch marking and recapture approach was applied to assess stocked Murray cod and golden perch survival, contributions to wild fisheries, and condition in rivers and impoundments. Stocked fish were marked with calcein. Marked fish were detected during surveys undertaken 3 years and 10 months from initial marking, and it is probable that marks will persist beyond this time. The proportion of calcein marked fish in the population sub-sample whose age was equal to, or less than, the number of years since release, varied by 7–94% for Murray cod, and 9–98% for golden perch. Higher proportions of marked fish were found in impoundments than rivers. Marked Murray cod had significantly steeper length–weight relationships (i.e. higher weight at a given length) to unmarked fish. Our results show that application of methods for discriminating stocked and wild fish provides critical information for the development of adaptive, location-specific stocking strategies.

AB  - Over the past half century, urbanization has caused drastic changes to the hydrology and geomorphology of streams and rivers. The Serpentine River is a low-elevation, rain-dominant river located in the City of Surrey, British Columbia. Over the years, urbanization of the watershed, particularly in the upper reaches, has degraded what once was high quality spawning habitat for five salmonid species. The current project is an evaluation of previous restoration efforts at seven study sites and a restoration plan to effectively increase spawning habitat in the Upper Serpentine River. Grain size analysis of the study sites found up to 57% fine sediment in the subsurface particles, attributing to siltation rates of 1.2-1.6 kg/m2/day. Erodible grain sizes at the study sites ranged from 29-164 mm, which mostly exceeded the median size of spawning gravel. These results were verified with a tracer rock study, which together concluded that instream structures were required to reduce tractive forces and increase gravel retention.
Newbury weirs, or constructed riffles, were proposed as treatments because their hydraulic characteristics increase flow resistance, promote gravel retention, and create intergravel flows. Newbury weirs involve large diameter rocks spanning across the entire stream, causing accumulation of gravel on the upstream side and pool formation downstream side. Substrate scoured at the pool will be deposited at the tail end of the pool, creating spawning habitat in accelerating and downwelling waters. Bank stabilization using dense live staking with a protective rock toe key was prescribed to reduce further channel incision and siltation. In the longterm, watershed-level priorities including passage through the Serpentine sea dam, monitoring for urban contaminants, and installation of green infrastructure was recommended.
The proposed treatments are relatively inexpensive, and if successful, will reduce repeat addition of spawning gravel and increase salmonid production in the Serpentine River. However, the value of the current project extends beyond fish productivity estimates. Monitoring data from restoration works can be used to inform future urban stream restoration projects and contribute to the continual improvement of restoration techniques. The effects of restoration on not only sediment form (ie. gravel depth and size) but also processes (ie. sediment scour and fill) should be investigated in the field to verify theoretical models.

AB  - Wild-genotype and growth hormone (GH) transgenic coho salmon (with dramatically enhanced growth potential) were used to examine the influence of genotype, age, body size, growth, and rearing conditions on the onset of seaward migration and to assess the potential consequences of the introduction of such transgenic fish on natural ecosystems and wild populations. When reared from the first feeding stage under naturalized stream conditions, there was no difference in survival or migratory timing between the two genotypes. However, larger fish migrated earlier in the season than smaller fish of both genotypes, and transgenic fish with higher specific spring growth rates migrated earlier in the season than slower-growing transgenic fish. Stream-reared fish of both genotypes also displayed increased migratory activity at dawn and dusk. Fish reared in the hatchery for 3 and 15 months before being released into the stream in August differed in onset of seaward migration due mainly to age (older fish migrated earlier in the season) and genotype (transgenic fish migrated before wild-type in younger fish). Further, hatchery-reared fish showed no diel pattern in activity during migration. In older fish, larger individuals migrated later in the season than small individuals, whereas there was no clear size effect in younger individuals. Thus, although small differences in spring migration timing were observed among groups, seaward migration in coho salmon was largely independent of major shifts in size and growth rate induced by GH transgenesis (i.e., transgenic fish migrated at approximately the normal time in the spring, rather than at the typical size). Further, early rearing conditions had a stronger effect on migratory behavior than did the growth-promoting transgene. Taking into account effects of migratory timing, growth, survival, and differential food conversion efficiencies, these data suggest that transgenic fish escaped from hatcheries would have a greater impact on stream ecosystems during early life compared to escaped wild-type fish. However, this difference may be reduced if rearing occurred in subsequent generations under wild conditions where growth rates of transgenic fish are reduced compared with hatchery conditions.

AB  - Law evolves to accommodate change—this is axiomatic in most academic legal traditions. But in the era of the administrative state, with congressional gridlock and a judiciary hesitant to address policy questions, evolution of statutory law has become much more difficult. This leads to pent up demand for change in legal regimes. If the legislature and the courts cannot provide an outlet for this pressure, where does it go? How does the law continue to change? Although other scholars have looked to agencies as engines of legal change, we lack a theoretical framework to understand how that change happens. I argue that an evolutionary framework provides an informative framework for understanding administrative legal change. I provide three case studies that demonstrate the administrative evolution of the Endangered Species Act. In spite of tremendous advances in conservation, fundamental changes in scientists’ understanding of human impacts on the natural world, and increasingly strident clashes over private property rights and endangered species, the Act has remained largely unchanged for the last 35 years. In a functioning legislative system, the Act would have been amended to accommodate many of these changes. Instead, the case studies show a mechanism of legal change through agency action analogous to the mechanisms underlying biological evolution. Other commentators have argued the administrative state stymies evolution of the law, but this research contradicts that view. Applying an evolutionary framework to administrative actions creates a new theory of administrative evolution of the law, placing administrative analysis within the long tradition of evolutionary approaches to legal change used by commentators from Aristotle to Holmes. In contrast to traditional normative theories of administrative law, an evolutionary approach focuses on how change progresses over time. This theory of administrative evolution of the law also casts new light on a host of normative questions, from the role of judicial review to improvements in agency decision-making. Considering administrative actions within the broader context of the legal evolution promises a fruitful new approach to analyzing administrative law.

AB  - Over the past decade, the sustainability of seafood production has improved and is cause for ocean optimism. In an attempt for recognition of ongoing efforts, many producers and food retailers now claim products are ‘sustainable’. What exactly does this mean and could we limit further improvement using this claim? Here, we discuss the sustainable/sustainability dichotomy, and the problem of communicating continual improvement in terms of grand and absolute claims – that is ‘We sell 100% sustainable product.’ We believe a statement like this risks short selling the challenges at hand and removes necessary and ongoing incentives for learning, improving and innovating. We argue the best path for producers and retailers is to demonstrate and communicate the concrete actions and achievements being made towards a more resilient and healthy food system today and for the future. This requires moving away from the current practice of calling products sustainable, and to instead work towards continually improving the sustainability of the products. Focusing on measuring the impact of our actions generates a wealth of substance and establishes a direction of travel towards seafood of greater sustainability and we believe this will help educate, inform and inspire consumers to make good choices for their own and future generations benefit. In this study, ‘seafood’ will refer to both farmed and wild seafood products, and ‘sustainability’ refers to the behavior that drives economic, environmental and ethical progress towards ensuring seafood availability ‘meet(s) the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’.

AB  - Abstract Preliminary surveillance of wild baitfish during the 2006 viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVb (VHSV IVb) outbreaks indicated Emerald Shiners Notropis atherinoides and Bluntnose Minnow Pimephales notatus were infected with high levels of VHSV without showing clinical signs of disease. The movement and use of baitfish was recognized as the most probable vector for the introduction of VHSV to inland waters, such as Conesus Lake and Skaneateles Lake in New York, Budd Lake in Michigan, and Little Lake Butte des Morts and Lake Winnebago in Wisconsin. While numerous government agencies implemented restrictions to stop the movement of potentially infected baitfish into new waters and prevent the spread of VHSV IVb, until now, studies to investigate whether these initial introductions were by an oral route of infection have not occurred. Our studies identified infected Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas as suitable vectors for transmitting VHSV IVb when fed to Tiger Muskellunge ( ♂ Northern Pi...

AB  - Abstract Feed ingredients and additives significantly affect the mucosal health of fish. A 3 × 2 factorial experiment was conducted to investigate the mucosal health of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fed three basal feeds (namely, BG1, BG5 and BG2; marine-, plant-, and soybean meal-based feeds, respectively) or the basal feeds with (+) or without (÷) probiotics, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum. Six diets were fed to fish distributed into 12 tanks (approximately 43 fish/tank). The average start weight of the experimental fish was about 122.6 g. After 38-days of feeding, the dorsal skin, gills and distal intestine were obtained for analysing histomorphometry and mucus-related genes. Digesta were also collected to study short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Fish fed BG2 had significantly higher number of mucous cells/μm2 skin epithelium (SNE) than those fed BG1 and BG5. Addition of probiotics significantly increased SNE in BG5+ and BG2+ group compared to BG1÷ group. Similarly, the area and number of mucous cells/μm2 gill epithelium (GME and GNE) were significantly higher in BG2 group, followed by BG5 and BG1 fish groups. Probiotics significantly increased GME and GNE in all feed types. Concerning intestine, villi height (VH) and enterocyte height (EH) were significantly higher for BG1 group, followed by BG5 and BG2 groups. Compared to fish offered BG2, fish fed BG1 had significantly wider villi (VW) and narrower lamina propria (LPW). The number of mucous cells (NM) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in the intestine were significantly higher in BG2 fed fish than those offered BG5 and BG1. The indices VH, VW, EH, and IEL were not affected by probiotics. Although higher NM and IEL were observed in BG2÷ fish compared to those fed the other two diets, probiotics reduced NM and IEL. Fish fed BG2÷ showed symptoms of inflammation, including disappearance of supranuclear vacuoles (SNV). Probiotics improved VH, significantly reduced LPW and aided in the reappearance of SNV in BG2+ fed fish. Some of the gene expression data supported histological findings; notably, levels of muc5ac1 in the skin and defensin3 and cathelcidin1 in the intestine were correlated with histology data. Moreover, the total SCFA concentration was significantly affected by feed ingredients. Only acetoacetic acid was affected by both factors. Our findings suggest that feed ingredients can significantly alter the mucosal protective barrier of the organs. Supplementation of probiotics alleviated the inflammatory responses and activated selected innate immune defence molecules, without affecting growth. The positive effect of the probiotics was similar regardless of the feed ingredients, suggesting that these probiotics can be utilized as immune regulators to evoke favourable responses on the skin, gills and intestine.

AB  - Translocation has been widely studied as a tool for conservation management to restore or enhance degraded populations. On the contrary, few studies have been conducted on translocation for commercial purposes. In this study, we evaluate the genetic consequences of translocation of wild individuals of Pinctada margaritifera on farmed and adjacent wild populations. We tested the hypotheses that translocations would induce high genetic heterogeneity in farmed populations and this heterogeneity would then leak into the adjacent wild populations. In fact, farmed samples exhibit high levels of heterogeneity and low pairwise relatedness compared to wild populations, highlighting the pooling of genetically divergent populations into farms. We also demonstrate that this heterogeneity is transmitted to adjacent wild populations as a result of interbreeding. Adjacent wild populations tend to have higher genetic diversity values and greater pairwise relatedness coefficient with farmed populations than wild populations. Overall, pearl culture in French Polynesia promotes the mixing of unrelated individuals in farmed locations and reduces genetic divergence among geographically distant populations as well as among farmed and wild populations of a same lagoon. We also studied for the first time a farmed population originating from spat collected in a lagoon where release of hatchery-produced larvae occurred 10 years ago and we were able to identify four distinct genetic groups. These groups contribute highly to reproduction and caused considerable genetic drift in the lagoon, suggesting that hatchery-produced larvae are neither sustainable method for pearl culture nor for conserving the diversity of P. margaritifera in French Polynesia.

AB  - Abstract The environmental sustainability of aquaculture food production systems is of critical concern due to its rapid expansion as the fastest growing major food production sector in the world. Among the parameters that contribute to the overall environmental impacts of aquaculture marine-based protein production, aquafeed is identified as an impact hotspot. There is consequently a need to seek more environmentally sustainable aquafeeds to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts associated with aquaculture food production. The environmental and economic sustainability of aquafeeds can be improved using two main approaches: (a) optimizing finite resources use (e.g. fish meal and fish oil), and (b) mitigating waste generation and emissions. A variety of ingredients have been previously proposed, investigated, and utilized to accomplish these strategies, while maintaining acceptable food production efficiencies. However, comprehensive evaluation of the environmental sustainability of aquafeeds with respect to variable ingredients, both in terms of resource use and waste emission has not been conducted. In this work, a holistic life cycle impact assessment of twelve practically formulated and utilized aquafeeds has been performed to provide a comparative evaluation of different aquafeed's environmental impacts, considering resource use (biotic resource use, water intake, and fossil fuel depletion) and emission-based impact categories (ozone depletion, global warming, photochemical smog, acidification, eutrophication, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, respiratory effects, and ecotoxicity). Results indicate that the investigated fish meal free diets do not, on the whole, result in a significant decrease in environmental impacts with respect to the use of biotic resources. However, if the substituted ingredients would not propose elevated impacts (e.g. blood meal), these diets can potentially lower the overall environmental impacts of aquafeed production mainly with respect to relevant emission-based indicators (e.g. global warming, eutrophication, ecotoxicity). Findings demonstrate that the investigated fish oil free diets can potentially lower the use of biotic resources. However, to prevent burden shifting, strategies to provide nutrient-rich oils with minimal energy requirement need to be undertaken.

AB  - The objective of Aquarius project was to test the applicability of a food chain analysis on Atlantic salmon farmed in Norway to identify and monitor vulnerabilities and drivers of change for the identification of emerging risks. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was conducted complemented with expert views collected by on-line questionnaires and in-depth interviews. This review provided an overview of the various stages in the supply chain from farm to consumer and the identification of i) existing and emerging human and animal health hazards, ii) vulnerabilities, iii) control measures, iv) drivers of change, and v) related indicators. Next step in the study was to i) complement the list of vulnerabilities followed by a prioritisation using focus group discussions and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method and ii) link drivers of change acting upon the (prioritised) vulnerabilities and identification of associated indicators and data sources by means of a Delphi method. Based on the experiences obtained with the different methodologies during this project, the Aquarius team considers literature review, and a direct face-to-face interaction with experts (in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and FMEA in a workshop setting) as being most effective regarding output and effort. The comprehensive information collected formed the basis for the methodology to baseline key indicators of the selected vulnerabilities. The methodology proposed comprised a Bayesian Network (BN) that links data sources for indicators and drivers of change to the prioritised vulnerabilities and was demonstrated for salmon health. A Decision Support System (DSS) with such BN integrated was designed. The current BN and DSS could flag an increased exposure of known hazards that may occur due to changes in indicators but new hazards are not identified. The proposed methodology could be used instead to show trends in vulnerabilities, indicators, increased exposure of known hazards and for scenario studies.

AB  - Sea lice threaten the welfare of farmed Atlantic salmon and the sustainability of fish farming across the world. Chemical treatments are the major method of control but drug resistance means that alternatives are urgently needed. Selective breeding can be a cheap and effective alternative. Here, we combine experimental trials and diagnostics to provide a practical protocol for quantifying resistance to sea lice. We then combined quantitative genetics with epidemiological modelling to make the first prediction of the response to selection, quantified in terms of reduced need for chemical treatments. We infected over 1400 young fish with Lepeophtheirus salmonis, the most important species in the Northern Hemisphere. Mechanisms of resistance were expressed early in infection. Consequently, the number of lice per fish and the ranking of families were very similar at 7 and 17 days post infection, providing a stable window for assessing susceptibility to infection. The heritability of lice numbers within this time window was moderately high at 0.3, confirming that selective breeding is viable. We combined an epidemiological model of sea lice infection and control on a salmon farm with genetic variation in susceptibility among individuals. We simulated 10 generations of selective breeding and examined the frequency of treatments needed to control infection. Our model predicted that substantially fewer chemical treatments are needed to control lice outbreaks in selected populations and chemical treatment could be unnecessary after 10 generations of selection. Selective breeding for sea lice resistance should reduce the impact of sea lice on fish health and thus substantially improve the sustainability of Atlantic salmon production.

AB  - Sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis [Krøyer, 1838]) are a key issue for salmon aquaculture, contributing to increased mortality for both wild and farmed salmon if no action is taken. Using cleaner fish can be an effective, drug-free treatment method, and ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) is a hardy wrasse species that displays cleaning behavior. With concerns about the overharvest of wild ballan wrasse, many companies farm this species, but the optimal ranges of a wide variety of rearing parameters are still unknown. This study investigated the effect of 6-week exposure to four dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (125%, 100%, 85%, and 75% DO saturation as the percentage of air) on ballan wrasse. Survival; growth (specific growth rate, SGR); condition factor (CF); and primary (cortisol), secondary (glucose, lactate, magnesium), and tertiary stress indicators (swimming performance) were investigated. There were no differences in SGR, CF, survival, or cortisol level among the groups at the end of the 6 weeks. There was variation in the magnitude of the cortisol response to an acute stressor at the end of the 6-week period, with the 75% DO treatment exhibiting a 3.3-fold increase in cortisol compared to a 5.2-fold increase in the control group (100%), which could suggest chronic stress. Relative critical swimming speed (RU<sub>crit</sub>) was measured to investigate swimming performance once all groups were returned to 100% DO saturation. The 75% RU<sub>crit</sub> was lower than the 100% treatment (1.7 ± 0.18 body length [BL]/s compared to 2.5 ± 0.16 BL/s). Overall, these results suggest that DO levels of 75% trigger physiological changes and therefore may negatively affect welfare.

AB  - Aquaculture is growing to meet the increasing demand for aquaculture products but is not free of environmental impacts. One solution is to improve how feed are formulated, limiting the environmental impact of fish production. Multiobjective (MO) formulation, which aims for a compromise between lower cost and lower environmental impacts, appears to be a promising solution to reduce the environmental footprint of aquaculture production. The objectives of this study were to design an eco-friendly trout feed (ECO-diet) using MO formulation and to compare its zootechnical and environmental performances to those of a commercial feed (C-diet) containing 16% fishmeal and 6.5% fish oil. MO formulation changed the composition of the diet greatly, which decreased environmental impacts of the feed as well as its price. It increased the number of ingredients used but reduced the use of fishmeal and fish oil by half. MO formulation also led to the elimination of soy products, faba bean, and gluten in favour of processed animal co-products that have high protein contents and low climate change impact. Rapeseed oil also disappeared from the ECO-diet due to its major contribution to land use, eutrophication, and acidification and, to a lesser extent, climate change. Overall, the ECO-diet had high digestibility, which differed little from that of the C-diet. Mean fish body weight after 12 weeks of growth did not differ significantly from that obtained with the C-diet, but analysis of fish growth curves indicated that the ECO-diet could lead to lower growth in the long term. This observation was consistent with the significantly lower feed intake in fish fed the ECO-diet. The decrease in impacts observed at the feed level was also observed at the farm level, although less so for eutrophication, non-renewable energy use, and climate change calculated per kg of body weight gain. MO formulation is a useful tool to reduce the environmental footprint of aquaculture production without compromising animal performances or necessarily increasing production cost.

AB  - In recent years, as a way to achieve higher agricultural output while reducing the negative impact of agricultural production on the environment, agricultural sustainable intensification has attracted worldwide attention. Under the framework of "connotation definition-measuring method-influencing factor-implementation path", this paper systematically sorts out the main research results in the field of agricultural sustainable intensification. The results show that: (1) The connotation of agricultural sustainable intensification has not been clearly defined. It is widely believed that sustainable intensification has the characteristics of increasing production and reducing environmental damage, and is widely used in agricultural, biological and environmental sciences; (2) The measurement methods and indicators of agricultural sustainable intensification are diverse, and the measurement cases are mainly distributed in Europe, Asia, Africa and America; (3) The influencing factors of agricultural sustainable intensification can be roughly divided into four aspects: socio-economic factors, farmers’ own characteristics and natural factors, among which population pressure is the potential driving force for agricultural sustainable intensification; (4) The most obvious feature of agricultural sustainable intensification is the reduction of the yield gap. The strategy of implementing agricultural sustainable intensification can be attributed to the effective use of inputs and the adoption of sustainable practices and technologies. Therefore, the implementation path can be summarized as enhancing the effectiveness of external inputs to the agricultural system and optimizing the practice and technology mix within the crop production system. Finally, this paper concludes that research on connotation definition, influencing mechanism, different regional models, incentive mechanism for farmers, impact evaluation and system design of agricultural sustainable intensification should be strengthened in future.

AB  - Potential interactions between marine predators and humans arise in the southern coast of Chile where predator feeding and reproduction sites overlap with fisheries and aquaculture. Here, we assess the potential effects of intensive salmon aquaculture on food habits, growth, and reproduction of a common predator, the spiny dogfish—identified as Squalus acanthias via genetic barcoding. A total of 102 (89 females and 13 males) individuals were collected during winter and summer of 2013–2014 from the Chiloe Sea where salmon aquaculture activities are concentrated. The low frequency of males in our study suggests spatial segregation of sex, while immature and mature females spatially overlapped in both seasons. Female spiny dogfish showed a functional specialist behavior as indicated by the small number of prey items and the relative high importance of the austral hake and salmon pellets in the diet. Immature sharks fed more on pellets and anchovies than the larger hake-preferring mature females. Our results also indicate that spiny dogfish switch prey (anchovy to hake) to take advantage of seasonal changes in prey availability. Despite differences in the trophic patterns of S. acanthias due to the spatial association with intensive salmon farming, in this region, there appears to be no difference in fecundity or size at maturity compared to other populations. Although no demographic effects were detected, we suggest that a range of additional factors should be considered before concluding that intensive aquaculture does not have any impact on these marine predators.

AB  - The overuse of antibiotics in aquaculture drives the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) can be disseminated to other bacteria through vertical- and horizontal gene transfer (VGT and HGT) under selective pressure. Profiling the antibiotic resistome and understanding the global distribution of ARGs constitutes the first step in developing a control strategy. Hence, this study utilized extensive genomic data from hundreds of Aeromonas strains in aquaculture to profile resistome patterns and explores their association with isolation year, country, and species characteristics. Overall, ∼400 Aeromonas genomes were used to predict the ARGs from A. salmonicida, A. hydrophila, A. veronii, A. media, and A. sobria. ARGs such as sul1, tet(A), and tet(D), which display a similar proportion of positive strains among species, were subjected to phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses. More than a hundred ARGs were identified, some of which exhibited either species-specific or non-species-specific patterns. A. salmonicida and A. media were found to have a higher proportion of species-specific ARGs than other strains, which might lead to more distinct patterns of ARG acquisition. Overall, ∼25% of strains have either sul1, tet(A), or tet(D) gene(s), but no significant difference was observed in the proportion of positive strains by species. Phylogeographic analysis revealed that the abundant numbers of sul1, tet(A), and/or tet(D) introduced in a few East Asian and North American countries could spread to both adjacent and faraway countries. In recent years, the proportions of these ARGs have dramatically increased, particularly in strains sourced from aquatic environments, suggesting control is required of the overuse of antibiotics in aquaculture. The findings of this research offer significant insights into the global dissemination of ARGs.

AB  - Pink salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, are the most abundant wild salmon species and are thought of as an indicator of ecosystem health. The salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is endemic to pink salmon habitat but these ectoparasites have been implicated in reducing local pink salmon populations in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia. This allegation arose largely because juvenile pink salmon migrate past commercial open net salmon farms, which are known to incubate the salmon louse. Juvenile pink salmon are thought to be especially sensitive to this ectoparasite because they enter the sea at such a small size (approx. 0.2 g). Here, we describe how 'no effect' thresholds for salmon louse sublethal impacts on juvenile pink salmon were determined using physiological principles. These data were accepted by environmental managers and are being used to minimize the impact of salmon aquaculture on wild pink salmon populations.

AB  - The chorion is the primary envelop that protects the fish embryo against mechanical actions, pathogens, and abrupt changes in physical and chemicals conditions of the incubation medium. During embryo development, chorion alterations are not rare, but the occurrence of these is scarcely reported. Increased frequency of chorion alterations can result in increased embryo mortality and thus decreased reproductive performance and losses for fish farms. In this study, we characterize different chorion alterations observed in samples collected over 14 years from 12 salmon and trout farms located in the region of La Araucania in southern Chile, which sent live eyed-stage embryos ('eyed-eggs') for quality analysis to our laboratory. We found soft chorion as the most common alteration observed, being present in the whole 14-year series analyzed in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) and affecting up to 35.0% of the samples examined in a year. This alteration also affected up to 20.0 and 5.7% of Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) samples analyzed in a year, respectively. We also found an increase of other chorion alterations, including perforated and white-spotted chorion in Atlantic and Coho Salmon, in the last 8 years. Among the three species, Rainbow Trout exhibited fewer chorion alterations. As the embryonated eggs analyzed here were obtained from broodstocks maintained under standard industrial conditions, these alterations might be linked to changes in environmental conditions affecting the incubation water that need to be further investigated.

AB  - It has been recognized that the cholinergic and adenosinergic systems have an essential role in immune and inflammatory responses during bacterial fish pathogens, such as the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and adenosine deaminase (ADA), which are responsible for catalysis of the anti-inflammatory molecules acetylcholine (ACh) and adenosine (Ado) respectively. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of the cholinergic and adenosinergic systems on the immune response and inflammatory process in gills of experimentally infected Rhamdia quelen with Streptococcus agalactiae. Acetylcholinesterase activity decreased, while ACh levels increased in gills of infected animals compared to uninfected animals. On the other hand, a significant increase in ADA activity with a concomitant decrease in Ado levels was observed in infected animals compared to uninfected animals. Based on this evidence, we concluded that infection by S. agalactiae in silver catfish alters the cholinergic and adenosinergic systems, suggesting the involvement of AChE and ADA activities on immune and inflammatory responses, regulating the ACh and Ado levels. In summary, the downregulation of AChE activity exerts an anti-inflammatory profile in an attempt to reduce or prevent the tissue damage, while the upregulation of ADA activity exerts a pro-inflammatory profile, contributing to disease pathophysiology.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of marine resources attempts to conserve interacting species. In contrast to single-species fisheries management, EBM aims to identify and resolve conflicting objectives for different species. Such a conflict may be emerging in the northeastern Pacific for southern resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) and their primary prey, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Both species have at-risk conservation status and transboundary (Canada–US) ranges. We modeled individual killer whale prey requirements from feeding and growth records of captive killer whales and morphometric data from historic live-capture fishery and whaling records worldwide. The models, combined with caloric value of salmon, and demographic and diet data for wild killer whales, allow us to predict salmon quantities needed to maintain and recover this killer whale population, which numbered 87 individuals in 2009. Our analyses provide new information on cost of lactation and new parameter estimates for other killer whale populations globally. Prey requirements of southern resident killer whales are difficult to reconcile with fisheries and conservation objectives for Chinook salmon, because the number of fish required is large relative to annual returns and fishery catches. For instance, a U.S. recovery goal (2.3% annual population growth of killer whales over 28 years) implies a 75% increase in energetic requirements. Reducing salmon fisheries may serve as a temporary mitigation measure to allow time for management actions to improve salmon productivity to take effect. As ecosystem-based fishery management becomes more prevalent, trade-offs between conservation objectives for predators and prey will become increasingly necessary. Our approach offers scenarios to compare relative influence of various sources of uncertainty on the resulting consumption estimates to prioritise future research efforts, and a general approach for assessing the extent of conflict between conservation objectives for threatened or protected wildlife where the interaction between affected species can be quantified.

AB  - It is crucial for the development of the fish aquaculture industry to be managed in a way that provides a reliable, long term source of products without negatively impacting the environment. The simplest form of integrated multi-tropic aquaculture (IMTA) uses a fed component (e.g. finfish) and an extractive component (e.g. seaweed) to remove the inorganic metabolites from finfish aquaculture effluent. In IMTA systems metabolic wastes become nutrients for the other cultured organisms and are incorporated into potentially valuable biomass. A demonstration-scale Modular Integrated Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (MIRAS) was constructed in a greenhouse adjacent to Great Bay Aquaculture, LLC (GBA), Newington, NH. The MIRAS consists of two independent demonstration scale modular systems each with four 4m3, 3600 L, white fiberglass tanks. Ammonium production rates were determined for Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua L.) and nutrient uptake rates for Porphyra umbilicalis Kutzing and P. linearis Greville. The ammonium kinetic characteristics of the fish and seaweed were used to develop a model to predict the system ammonium dynamics. Integrated fish/seaweed trials were run in the MIRAS to test the predictive model using varied fish feed rates and seaweed biomass. The trials showed that the model may be used to predict the effect of various parameters on the system's nutrient levels. Thus, an aquaculture operation may use the model to maintain desired system nutrient levels that will meet the needs of both the finfish and Porphyra and meet production goals. Porphyra produced in the MIRAS was used to partially replace fish meal as a source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids in the cod fish diets. The net effect is to convert a greater portion of the system protein input into fish biomass and to discharge less nitrogenous waste.

AB  - Abstract Many vaccine formulations, in particular vaccines based on inactivated virus, needs adjuvants to boost immunogenicity. In aquaculture, mineral and plant oil are used as adjuvant in commercial vaccines, and the advent of oil-adjuvanted vaccines was crucial to aquaculture development. Nevertheless, some of these approved vaccines display suboptimal performance in the field compared to experimental conditions. Therefore, there is a need to improve adjuvants and delivery methods for fish vaccines against viruses. We used RNA sequencing of Atlantic salmon head kidney to analyse the difference in gene expression 24 h after injection of different experimental vaccine formulations. We compared five different formulations in addition to a PBS control: inactivated virus alone (group V), soluble poly (I:C) (group P), nanoparticles containing poly (I:C) (group N), soluble poly (I:C) + inactivated virus (group PV) and finally nanoparticles containing poly (I:C) + inactivated virus (group NV). Our results showed poly (I:C)’s ability as adjuvant and its capacity influence innate immune genes expression in Atlantic salmon. Soluble poly (I:C) upregulated multiple immune related genes and was more effective compared to poly (I:C) formulated into chitosan nanoparticles (more than 10 fold increase in differentially expressed genes, DEGs). However, inclusion of inactivated ISA virus in the nanoparticle vaccine, increased the number of DEGs fivefold suggesting a synergistic effect of adjuvant and antigen. Our results indicate that the way poly (I:C) is formulated and the presence of antigen is important for the magnitude of the innate immune response in Atlantic salmon.

AB  - <jats:p>Piscirickettsiosis is one of the most important diseases affecting farmed salmonid in Chile. Several studies have demonstrated the survival of <jats:italic>Piscirickettsia salmonis</jats:italic> in seawater and the horizontal transmission from infected to non-infected fish; however, the extent of waterborne transmission between farms has not been quantified. In this study, we used a stochastic hydrodynamic connectivity-based disease spread model to determine the role of hydrodynamic connectivity and the effect of seawater temperature and salinity on the dynamics of piscirickettsiosis in the Los Lagos region of Chile. Results demonstrate that environmental dynamics play a major role in disease prevalence. The strongest determinants of piscirickettsiosis prevalence were the number of infected farms in upstream waters and the extent of disease outbreaks in upstream waters (total mortality), followed by seawater salinity and temperature. In farms downstream from infected farms, observed disease prevalence 25 wk into the farming cycle was close to 100%, while in farms with little or no exposure to upstream, infected farms, prevalence reached only ~10% by the end of the farming cycle (Week 56). No previous studies have quantified the scales of connectivity associated with piscirickettsiosis or provided risk metrics of waterborne transmission of the disease among farms; these are a novel aspect of this research. The above knowledge regarding the use of the epidemiological model will allow industry and regulators to better target disease control strategies for more effective control of piscirickettsiosis in the study area.</jats:p>

AB  - Growth in salmon aquaculture over the past two decades has raised concerns regarding the potential impacts of the industry on neighboring ecosystems and wild fish productivity. Despite limited evidence, sea lice have been identified as a major cause for the decline in some wild Pacific salmon populations on the west coast of Canada. We used sea lice count and management data from farmed and wild salmon, collected over 10 years (2007-2016) in the Muchalat Inlet region of Canada, to evaluate the association between sea lice recorded on salmon farms with the infestation levels on wild out-migrating Chum salmon. Our analyses indicated a significant positive association between the sea lice abundance on farms and the likelihood that wild fish would be infested. However, increased abundance of lice on farms was not significantly associated with the levels of infestation observed on the wild salmon. Our results suggest that Atlantic salmon farms may be an important source for the introduction of sea lice to wild Pacific salmon populations, but that the absence of a dose response relationship indicates that any estimate of farm impact requires more careful evaluation of causal inference than is typically seen in the extant scientific literature.

AB  - <jats:p>Precision feeding aims to provide the correct amount of feed to farmed animals for optimal growth and performance and to avoid feed waste. However, knowledge underlying the meal-to-meal variability in voluntary feed intake of farmed species is still limited. This study examined the relationship between meals, feed deprivation time and the feed (pellets) consumed by Atlantic salmon post smolts. The data was collected from individual fish handfed to satiety without social interaction in three independent short-term (6-12 days) experiments. The fixed variables of our model (feed deprivation time (i.e., time between meals), number of pellets provided, day, previous meal size, and fish growth) explained most of the feed intake (number of pellets ingested) (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> 0.68). Results show that fish ingested more pellets over the course of the trials as they grew, resulting in a positive correlation between feed intake and fish growth (final minus initial fish weight). The time between meals and prior meal size (the number of pellets ingested in the previous meal) significantly affected feed intake in the following meal. Our results suggest that it is possible to optimise meal size by considering the size of the previous meal and the time since it was given.</jats:p>

AB  - This study explored the relative competitive ability and performance of first-feeding growth hormone (GH) transgenic and non-transgenic Atlantic salmon Salmo salar fry under low food conditions. Pair-wise dominance trials indicated a strong competitive advantage for residents of a contested foraging territory. Transgenic and non-transgenic individuals, however, were equally likely to be dominant. Similarly, in stream environments with limited food, the transgene did not influence the growth in mass or survival at high or low fry densities. Fry in low-density treatments, however, performed better than fry in high-density treatments. These results indicate that, under the environment examined, the growth performance of GH-transgenic and non-transgenic S. salar may be similar during first feeding, an intense period of selection in their life history. Similarities in competitive ability and growth performance with wild-type fish suggest that the capacity of transgenic S. salar to establish in natural streams may not be inhibited during early life history.

AB  - It is well known that salmon aquaculture is a cyclical industry with substantial price volatility. However, limited attention has been given to the economic performance of the firms in the industry or their valuation. In this article we look closer at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in the Norwegian salmon farming industry. This is among the most common accounting measures of firm performance, and it is also used extensively in firm valuations. We find that the components of earnings have different time series behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that earnings from the Norwegian salmon farming industry can be characterized as a random walk. However, earnings/kg of fish sold is a more predictable variable and is mean reverting with clear cycles.

AB  - Aquaculture is an emerging sector that is associated with most of the same hazards that are present in agriculture generally, but many fish farming tasks entail added danger, including working around water and working at night. Comprehensive studies of these hazards have not been conducted, and substantial uncertainty exists as to the extent of these hazards. The question addressed in this investigation was, "What is known about potential hazardous occupational exposures to aquatic plant and animal farmers?" In this review, causes of death included drowning, electrocution, crushing-related injury, hydrogen sulfide poisoning, and fatal head injury. Nonfatal injuries were associated with slips, trips, and falls; machines; strains and sprains; chemicals; and fires. Risk factors included cranes (tip over and power line contact), tractors and sprayer-equipped all-terrain vehicles (overturn), heavy loads (lifting), high-pressure sprayers, slippery surfaces, rotting waste (hydrogen sulfide production), eroding levees (overturn hazard), storm-related rushing water, diving conditions (bends and drowning), nighttime conditions, working alone, lack of training, lack of or failure to use personal flotation devices, and all-terrain vehicle speeding. Other hazards included punctures or cuts from fish teeth or spines, needlesticks, exposure to low temperatures, and bacterial and parasitic infections .

Sci. 69, this issue) about the hypothesis that salmon farms are a major source of sea lice on juvenile wild salmon. We show that there is nothing in their commentary that changes our original conclusions. Importantly, further analyses overturn their conclusion that “our observations of high abundances of C. clemensi at a low-exposure site fail to support the hypothesis proposed by Price et al. (2010)”.

AB  - Antibiotics are antimicrobial agents primarily produced by certain bacteria and fungi. These drugs are some of the biological weapons used by the producers to survive in their dense and multispecies communities where the resources could be scarce. Thus, the microorganisms, as antibiotic producers, also have the skills to avoid the antibiotic affect from immemorial time. However, the antibiotic resistance is a current global health threat because of the overuse, abuse, or use of antibiotics. Nowadays, resistance to all the antibiotic classes has emerged, which results in 700,000 annual deaths due to the drug-resistant diseases, and forecasts are dramatic for the coming years. This chapter reviews the evolution of the antibiotics discovery, the worldwide antibiotics resistances threat, their economical and clinical impact, as well as how the academia and the enterprises are facing the need of new antibiotics discovery or antimicrobial therapies implementation.

AB  - Juvenile pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta were sampled by beach or purse seine to assess levels of sea lice infestation in the Knight Inlet and Broughton Archipelago regions of coastal British Columbia, Canada, during the months of March to July from 2003 to 2012. Beach seine data were analyzed for sea lice infestation that was de - scribed in terms of prevalence, abundance, intensity, and intensity per unit length. The median annual prevalence for chum was 30%, ranging from 14% (in 2008 and 2009) to 73% (in 2004), while for pink salmon, the median was 27% and ranged from 10% (in 2011) to 68% (in 2004). Annual abundance varied from 0.2 to 5 sea lice per fish with a median of 0.47 for chum and from 0.1 to 3 lice (median 0.42) for pink salmon. Annual infestation followed broadly similar trends for both chum and pink salmon. However, the abundance and intensity of Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi, the 2 main sea lice species of interest, were significantly greater on chum than on pink salmon in around half of the years studied. Logistic regression with random effect was used to model prevalence of sea lice infestation for the combined beach and purse seine data. The model suggested inter-annual variation as well as a spatial clustering effect on the prevalence of sea lice infestation in both chum and pink salmon. Fish length had an effect on prevalence, although the nature of this effect differed according to host species.

AB  - Abstract This study compares the environmental performances of two protein sources for aquafeed production: Brazilian soy protein and Norwegian seaweed protein concentrates. The efficiency and sustainability of these two production systems are assessed using a comparative material and substance flow analysis accounting for the transfers of primary energy and phosphorus. The primary energy and phosphorus demand of 1 t of soy protein concentrate is compared to 2 t seaweed protein concentrate to assess commodities with similar protein contents. The primary energy consumption of the latter protein source (172,133 MJ) is found 11.68 times larger than for the soy-based concentrate (14,733 MJ). However, the seaweed protein energy requirement can be reduced to 34,010 MJ if secondary heat from a local waste incineration plant is used to dry the biomass during the late-spring harvest. The seaweed system outperformed the soy system regarding mineral phosphorus consumption since 1 t of soy protein requires 25.75 kg mineral phosphorus while 2 t of seaweed protein require as little as 0.008 kg input. These results indicate that substituting soy protein with seaweed protein in aquafeed leads to an environmental trade-off. The seaweed value chain produces proteins with near zero mineral phosphorus consumption by using naturally occurring marine phosphorus while the soy value-chain produces proteins for roughly 1/12th of the primary energy required by seaweed. Based on the current production technology, the seaweed value-chain will require extensive innovation and economies of scale to become energy competitive. Further research should investigate the predictive environmental impacts of a fully developed seaweed protein concentrate value-chain and account for the background emissions and multi-functionality in each system.

AB  - A participacao de animais silvestres, principalmente roedores, na epidemiologia da leptospirose e fato indiscutivel. Em geral comportam-se como portadores permanentes de varios sorovares de leptospiras. Esta permanencia faz com que seja fonte perene para a infeccao no humano e outras especies. A Leptospirose e uma doenca bacteriana de carater zoonotico que afeta os animais domesticos, silvestres e o humano. Conforme o estudo retrospectivo da leptospira no Zoologico de Uberaba, dos animais estudados, 17 (12,98%) foram reagentes para anticorpos contra Leptospira spp, observou-se a necessidade de um trabalho direcionado quanto ao controle dos roedores, pelo fato de que algumas destas especies adaptam-se melhor as condicoes ambientais criadas pelo ser humano, principalmente os murideos (Rattus rattus), vivendo proximo ao humano e sobrevivem a partir da triade do roedor que sao do fornecimento de agua, abrigo e alimento.O estabelecimento de medidas para controle da leptospirose no Zoologico abrangeu varios aspectos, dentre eles o manejo integrado de praga e vetores, onde o enfoque foi o controle de roedores e a atividade educativa para a conscientizacao da populacao e funcionarios. O combate aos roedores esta ligado, cada vez mais, ao conhecimento de sua biologia, habitos, habilidades e capacidade fisica, bem como no meio ambiente onde estes animais estao localizados.

Here, we examined effects of chinook salmon (Oncorhychus tshawytscha), an exotic species introduced to Lake Ontario to enhance recreational angling, on reintroduced Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in a Lake Ontario tributary stream. Field enclosure studies revealed that adult Atlantic salmon activity rate was elevated, nest establishment delayed and mortality rates higher in the presence of chinook salmon. These results suggest that chinook salmon in Lake Ontario streams during fall spawning could impede successful re-establishment of Atlantic salmon in the lake.

Türkiye is the largest producer of rainbow trout in Europe, but there is little data on its CF. This study aimed to evaluate the CF expended of concrete pond rainbow trout (CPRT) farming. The data were obtained from a farm with an annual project production capacity of 350 tonnes (APC) over a three-year production (TYP) with different harvest amounts. The total CF expended was the summation of CF expended on compound diets, general management, transportation and machinery, equipment, and construction. The total CF expended was calculated at 1.78 and 1.67 kg CO2e on average for TYP and APC, respectively. The TYP average values of CF expended per kg of protein deposited in harvested/fresh weight fish and CF expended per Mcal of cultural energy expended during production were 10.66 and 0.36 kg CO2e, respectively. The CF expended per 100 kcal food energy in harvested fish was calculated at 0.1263 and 0.1173 kg CO2e on average for TYP and APC, respectively. Aquafeed production and transportation are the important CF expended sources in CPRT. Future studies must be species-specific and culture-specific.</jats:p>

The misuse of antibiotics is a primary contributor to this issue. This study investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding antibiotic use among cage fish farmers on Ghana's Volta Lake.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHOD" NlmCategory="METHODS">We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 91 cage fish farmers across three scales: small, medium, and large. A semi-structured questionnaire complemented by personal observations provided comprehensive data. We used several statistical methods for analysis: Pearson Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests to examine relationships and trends among variables, logistic regression to analyze variable interactions, and Cronbach's alpha to check internal consistency. Additionally, Kendall's coefficient was used to rank challenges, utilizing STATA and SPSS for these calculations.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The survey revealed that 58.55% of cage fish farmers earn an average of 10,000 USD annually, with 35.16% having over 16 years of experience. From the survey, all sampled populations admitted to antibiotic applications in their farming operation. Knowledge of antibiotic types was mainly influenced by peers (46.15%), with tetracycline being the most recognized and used. There was a significant reliance on the empirical use of antibiotics, with 52.75% of farmers using them based on personal experience and 40.66% without a prescription. When initial treatments failed, 41.76% of the farmers would change or combine drugs. Older farmers (over 51 years) and those with tertiary education demonstrated significantly better KAP scores regarding antibiotic use. Strong correlations were also found among knowledge, attitudes, and practices in antibiotic usage.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The findings indicate a need for improved education on antibiotic use among fish farmers to reduce misuse and enhance awareness of the potential consequences. This study provides foundational data for designing interventions to address these issues in the context of cage fish farming on Volta Lake.</AbstractText>

AB  - This paper discusses the controversial management decisions made by policy-makers worldwide regarding poisoning campaigns aimed to control small mammal populations, often considered harmful economic pests. Aside from considerations regarding the biological consequences of these campaigns, we argue that when society rejects all values of science and expertise then only badly supported and negligent decisions will be made about conservation and management issues. The extermination of small mammal species, some of which play crucial ecological roles in several regions of the world, is just an example of such discredit and misinformation. Without a strong commitment towards evidence-based policy-making, economic investments in research and development could be entirely compromised [ Current Zoology 58 (2): 353–357, 2012].

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>EU aquaculture produces only a small fraction of the internal demand of aquatic foods, but boosting this activity must be done in compliance with high standards of environmental protection and social benefits, as fostered by the policies on circular economy recently launched by the EU. Nevertheless, the assessment of the environmental sustainability of aquaculture and other food production systems is complex, due to the different tools and approaches available. Moreover, the current EU regulatory framework may be restricting the options to implement some circular solutions. This paper examines the controversies related to the assessment of environmental impacts of aquaculture processes and the different available circular solutions, with a focus on the best options to valorize aquaculture side streams and how current regulatory burdens and gaps should be solved.</jats:p>

AB  - Anemia in salmonid aquaculture is a recognized blood disorder resulting from the reduction of hemoglobin concentration and/or erythrocyte count. Because of sub-optimal oxygen supply to the tissues, as a negative impact of anemia fish will experience reduced growth and poor health. This health challenge may be linked with several factors including anthropogenic changes in the marine environment, infectious etiology (viral, bacterial, and parasitic), nutritional deficiencies, or hemorrhaging. From the mid-late summer of 2017 to 2019, Scottish salmon farming companies began to report the occurrence of anemic events in open-net marine sites. At that time, the industry had little understanding of the pathogenesis and possible mechanisms of anemia and limited the ability to formulate effective mitigation strategies. Clinical examination of fish raised suspicion of anemia and this was confirmed by generating a packed cell volume value by centrifugation of a microhematocrit tube of whole anticoagulated blood. Company health team members, including vets and biologists, reported discoloration of gills and local hemorrhages. This paper reviews various commercially significant cases and lesser-known cases of anemia in cultured salmonid species induced by various biological factors. The current methods available to assess hematology are addressed and some future methods that could be adopted in modern day fish farming are identified. An account of the most recent anemic event in Scottish farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is presented and discussed as a case study from information provided by two major Scottish salmon producers. The percent of total marine sites (n = 80) included in this case study, that reported with suspected or clinical anemia covering the period mid-late summer 2017 to 2019, was between 1 and 13%. The findings from this case study suggest that anemia experienced in most cases was regenerative and most likely linked to blood loss from the gills. • Anemia outbreaks identified in 1–13% of Scottish Atlantic salmon farms surveyed mid-late summer 2017 to 2019. • In most cases, anemia was regenerative and likely linked to blood loss via the gills. • Anemia is most likely associated with microhemorrhages identified on the gills and liver. • Routine hematology required for fish health monitoring and the development of automated analyzers is required.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the shelf life and quality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) slaughtered onboard vessels and shipped to Denmark in −0.8 °C refrigerated seawater (RSW) as compared to traditional land-based slaughtering facilities having fish on ice. The quality and shelf life were measured on fresh and smoked fillets including blood spot counting, fillet gaping, texture hardness, microbiological counts, Quality Index Method (QIM) and sensory analysis. Blood spot counting and fillet gaping were measured on smoked fillets. Fresh fish slaughtered onboard the vessel had significantly lower fillet gaping scores as compared to those slaughtered at the facility, while no difference was found on smoked fillets. There were no significant differences in blood spots counts nor texture hardness between any of the groups. Salmon slaughtered on the vessel had a significant lower QIM score. The total mesophilic count and H2S producing bacteria for fish slaughtered onboard vessels were significant lower at the end of storage (21d). Sensory analysis after 18 days of storage revealed minimal differences between the groups, whereas fish from the vessel had lower protein precipitation. We conclude that fish slaughtered onboard vessels and transported in superchilled RSW onboard a slaughter vessel presents good quality and improves shelf life over time.

AB  - <jats:p> Conservation, like beauty, is clearly in the eye of the beholder. The lack of a clear definition of what is meant by the term conservation, however, may encourage misconceptions about the degree to which biological objectives can be traded off against pressing economic and social objectives. Our purpose is to promote a dialogue about the meaning and practice of conservation, which might lead toward consensus on essential biological objectives. We present a brief history of the philosophical evolution of the term conservation and offer a definition of conservation based on the argument for an ecological ethic. This ethic requires that human benefits be derived in a sustainable manner and recognizes that human uses need to be reconciled with intrinsic and necessary ecosystemic functions and structures. We then present a preliminary set of operating principles applicable to the management of fish stocks that are consistent with an ecological or ecosystemic view of conservation. By proposing a set of conservation principles for fisheries management we hope to initiate a debate about just what those principles ought to be. </jats:p>

AB  - Fisheries management and sustainability assessment of fisheries more generally have recently expanded their scope from single-species stock assessment to ecosystem-based approaches, aiming to incorporate economic, social and local environmental impacts, while still excluding global-scale environmental impacts. In parallel, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has emerged as a widely used and recommended framework to assess environmental impacts of products, including global scale impacts. For over a decade, LCA has been applied to seafood supply chains, leading to new insights into the environmental impact of seafood products. We present insights from seafood LCA research with particular focus on evaluating fisheries management, which strongly influences the environmental impact of seafood products. Further, we suggest tangible ways in which LCA could be taken up in management. By identifying trade-offs, LCA can be a useful decision support tool and avoids problem shifting from one concern (or activity) to another. The integrated, product-based and quantitative perspective brought by LCA could complement existing tools. One example is to follow up fuel use of fishing, as the production and combustion of fuel used dominates overall results for various types of environmental impacts of seafood products, and is also often linked to biological impacts of fishing. Reducing the fuel use of fisheries is therefore effective to reduce overall impacts. Allocating fishing rights based on environmental performance could likewise facilitate the transition to low-impact fisheries. Taking these steps in an open dialogue between fishers, managers, industry, NGOs and consumers would enable more targeted progress towards sustainable fisheries.

AB  - Fish-pathogenic bacteria of the <i>Tenacibaculum</i> genus are a serious emerging concern in modern aquaculture, causing tenacibaculosis in a broad selection of cultured finfish. Data describing their virulence mechanisms are scarce and few means, antibiotic treatment aside, are available to control their proliferation in aquaculture systems. We genome sequenced a collection of 19 putative <i>Tenacibaculum</i> isolates from outbreaks at two aquaculture facilities and tested their susceptibility to treatment with tropodithietic acid (TDA)-producing <i>Roseobacter</i> group probiotics. We found that local outbreaks of <i>Tenacibaculum</i> can involve heterogeneous assemblages of species and strains with the capacity to produce multiple different virulence factors related to host invasion and infection. The probiotic Phaeobacter piscinae S26 proved efficient in killing pathogenic <i>Tenacibaculum</i> species such as <i>T. maritimum</i>, <i>T. soleae</i>, and some <i>T. discolor</i> strains. However, the <i>T. mesophilum</i> and <i>T. gallaicum</i> species exhibit natural tolerance toward TDA and are hence not likely to be easily killed by TDA-producing probiotics. Tolerance toward TDA in <i>Tenacibaculum</i> is likely involving multiple inherent physiological features pertaining to electron and proton transport, iron sequestration, and potentially also drug efflux mechanisms, since genetic determinants encoding such features were significantly associated with TDA tolerance. Collectively, our results support the use of TDA producers to prevent tenacibaculosis; however, their efficacy is likely limited to some <i>Tenacibaculum</i> species. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A productive and sustainable aquaculture sector is needed to meet the UN sustainable development goals and supply the growing world population with high-protein food sources. A sustainable way to prevent disease outbreaks in the industry is the application of probiotic bacteria that can antagonize fish pathogens in the aquaculture systems. TDA-producing <i>Roseobacter</i> group probiotics have proven efficient in killing important vibrio pathogens and protecting fish larvae against infection, and yet their efficacy against different fish pathogenic species of the <i>Tenacibaculum</i> genus has not been explored. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of such potential probiotics against a collection of different <i>Tenacibaculum</i> isolates and found the probiotic to efficiently kill a subset of relevant strains and species, supporting their use as sustainable disease control measure in aquaculture.

AB  - <jats:p>Vaccines prepared from formalin-killed Streptococcus agalactiae were administered to Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) via three different routes: immersion in a water-based vaccine, injection with an oil-based vaccine, and as a water-based oral vaccine. All vaccination treatments increased lysozyme and peroxidase activity in skin mucus of Nile tilapia by 1.2- to 1.5-fold compared to their activities in unvaccinated control fish. Likewise, alternative complement, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst activities in the blood serum of the vaccinated fish were 1.2- to 1.5-times higher than in the unvaccinated fish. In addition, the expression transcripts of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were 2.3- to 2.9-fold higher in the vaccinated fish compared to those in the unvaccinated control. The unvaccinated fish challenged with Streptococcus agalactiae had a survival rate of 25% compared to a survival rate of 78–85% for the vaccinated fish. The differences between the unvaccinated and vaccinated fish were all statistically significant, but there was no significant difference in any of the indicators of immunity between the three vaccinated groups. Collectively, these results confirm that vaccination with formalin-killed Streptococcus agalactiae significantly improved the resistance of Nile tilapia to infection by the pathogen. Overall, the efficacy of oral administration of the vaccine was comparable to that of vaccine administered via injection, indicating that oral vaccination is a viable cost-effective alternative to administering vaccines by injection.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Schism is the new normal for the bioeconomy concept. Since its proliferation in governments, the concept has been adapted to fit national or regional exigencies. Earlier this century the knowledge-based bioeconomy (KBBE) in Europe was seen as a technical and knowledge fix in the evolving sustainability landscape. At the OECD, the concept was further honed by imagining a future where biotechnologies contribute significantly to economic growth and development. Countries started to make national bioeconomy strategies. Some countries have diverged and made the bioeconomy both much larger and more general, involving a wide variety of sectors, such as industry, energy, healthcare, agriculture, aquaculture, forestry and fishing. Whatever the approach, what seems to be consistent is the need to reconcile environmental, social and economic sustainability. This paper attempts to establish one schism that could have ramifications for the future development of the bioeconomy. Some countries, including some of the largest economies but not exclusively so, are clearly following a biotechnology model, whereas others are clearly not. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, biotechnologies offer outstanding potential in healthcare, although this sector is by no means included in all bioeconomy strategies. The paper also attempts to clarify how biotechnologies can address the grand challenges and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The communities of scientists seem to have no difficulty with this, but citizens and governments find it more difficult. In fact, some biotechnologies are already well established, whereas others are emerging and more controversial.</jats:p>

AB  - Invasive species can have strong impact on the local ecosystem, not only substantial impact on the local ecosystem, but also on economy and human health. This review on marine alien species outlines aspects of prevention, eradication and control strategies. When managing invasive species, prevention is preferable and less costly than controlling species. Especially for marine environments, invasive species can disperse rapidly and can be particularly hard to detect.

AB  - Acoustic deterrent devices (ADDs) are used globally by the aquaculture industry to attempt to reduce pinniped depredation. However, noise from ADDs sited in areas used by cetaceans may lead to changes in cetacean behaviour and displacement from habitats impacting conservation status. Here, we investigate whether ADD noise from aquaculture within a habitat reduces acoustic detections of harbour porpoises, indicating either displacement or changes in echolocation activity. Nine years (2011–2019) of boat-based acoustic line-transect data for harbour porpoises were collected across the west coast of Scotland together with ADD presence and perceived loudness recorded by volunteers at regular listening stations along each transect. The most intense ADD noise coincided with significantly fewer harbour porpoise detections than in areas with no ADD noise. This corresponded with an estimated displacement of 34 % of the total undisturbed population, assuming that there was no change in echolocation behaviour. Furthermore, significant responses occurred at estimated received sound levels from ADDs >108 dB re 1 μPa RMS (frequency weighted for harbour porpoises). These findings suggest porpoises are either displaced from habitats degraded by intense ADD noise and/or echolocate less. In Scotland, ADD use in aquaculture has required a license since 2021. Limiting licensing, and monitoring ADD use by aquaculture should be considered by conservation managers globally, particularly in areas used by acoustically sensitive protected species. Non-acoustic (and non-lethal) measures to mitigate pinniped depredation on aquaculture sites are available and should be encouraged.

AB  - A total of 230 anadromous Salmo trutta (brown trout) were sampled in five sheltered coastal fjords (or sea lochs) on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, U.K., in 2016 at varying distances from active Atlantic salmon Salmo salar farms. Statistical models were developed to investigate potential correlations between salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis burdens on S. trutta hosts and their proximity to S. salar farm cages. Significant correlations were found between lice burdens and fish fork length and proximity to the nearest S. salar farm. The probability of the presence of L. salmonis on fish hosts increased with fish host size and with distance from the nearest S. salar farm, but total lice burdens were highest in fish sampled near S. salar farms and decreased with distance. The proportion of different life‐cycle stages of L. salmonis were also dependent on S. salar farm proximity, with higher juvenile lice numbers recorded at sites near S. salar farm cages. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between S. trutta and L. salmonis infections on wild fish and emphasise the requirement of further research to quantify these effects to better inform conservation and management strategies, particularly in areas of active S. salar farm facilities.

AB  - Atlantic salmon populations across the world have diverse ecological and evolutionary histories, from wild anadromous or landlocked, to domestication and genetic modification. The natural host behaviours confer protection from infestation by ectoparasitic salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis, yet whether genetic origin results in different behaviours and thus susceptibility to infestation is unknown. In common garden experiments, we tested antiparasite behaviours, susceptibility and retention of salmon lice in wild anadromous, wild landlocked, domesticated and genetically modified domesticated strains. Within domesticated strains, we tested two infestation histories (previously infested and naive) and a new phenotype (albino colouring). Farmed stocks initially acquired 24%-44% higher levels of parasite density than the wild and landlocked strains. Burst swimming and displacement behaviours were higher in the domesticated groups, and jumping was more prevalent in the domesticated strains. At 34 days post-infestation, domesticated strains and the wild anadromous strain did not differ significantly from each other; however, landlocked salmon had increased infestation levels considerably. Domesticated strains lost ~20% (±9.9%-16.5%; 95% CI) of their initial parasite load, while parasite load increased by 5.5% (±30.1%) for wild salmon and 20.1% (±28.5%) in landlocked salmon. This study provides early evidence for diverged host-parasite interactions associated with domestication in this system.

AB  - Making food systems more sustainable is one of humanity’s largest challenges. Over two decades of life cycle assessment research on the environmental performance of food systems has helped to inform efforts to address this challenge. In recent years, there has been much interest in aggregating the results of these studies at scales of national production, dietary patterns, and future food scenarios. The process of comparing impacts of diverse products based on extant literature presents numerous challenges which have been inadequately addressed. Drawing upon examples of greenhouse gas emissions and seafood systems, we suggest best practices to support more complete, consistent, and comparable aggregation practices. Ultimately this would lead to more robust industry and consumer decisions and public policy. We suggest to: 1) define product groups reflecting impact drivers and in accordance with study goals, 2) select studies in a transparent way whose methods are consistent, and 3) assess results in the context of actual production or consumption patterns. Applying these practices would strengthen food life cycle assessment aggregation studies as a tool guiding towards sustainable food systems.

AB  - As the world’s population grows, there are greater demands placed on the natural environment to feed people – people whose dietary expectations have changed with globalization and a greater awareness of how other people live. With this increase in the consumption of animal protein, aquaculture has been portrayed as the latest technological panacea to save the environment, promote economic development, and strengthen food security. Aquaculture has also been vilified as depriving fishers of their way of life and causing damage to the marine and coastal environment. In the United States, while there are a number of structural impediments (especially a confusing array of regulatory bodies at the federal level), there are also social and state supports that allow for the development of aquaculture as a sustainable alternative to capture fisheries. Based on participant-observation fieldwork on North Carolina fish farmers in 2011-2012, this project will examine how elements in the culture of aquaculture can develop sustainable fish farming. Problems in the sustainability of aquaculture have been traced to: a tight coupling to ecosystems and dependence on common-pool resources; poor farm management; weak governance, especially over the environment and market; and a lack of knowledge flow (scientific, technological, and economic) among farmers and between farmers, state agents, and consumers. Because the bulk of NC aquaculture is freshwater or in recirculating aquaculture systems, small-scale, and producing products largely for a niche market (for live fish or lesserknown species such as prawn), fish farmers and the state government in North Carolina are largely able to rely on information-based environmental governance to develop sustainable aquaculture enterprises.

AB  - The Norwegian coastal area is the most efficient region for fishery production in the world`s oceans, the Norway is the world`s top 10 fisheries countries through efficient fishing and fishing aquaculture technology and its scientific management of fisheries bio-resources, with Norwegian salmon having attained the world`s highest level. In the late 1980s, fisheries resources were depleted due to overfishing and fish diseases, resulting in a crisis in the fishing industry that lasted until the early 1990s. Since the national fishery emergency, people involved in the fishing industry, including fishermen, research scientists, and government officers, have tried to overcome the challenges facing the industry and identify an appropriate management model for fisheries bio-resources in the Norwegian coastal area. First, research vessels were used to monitor water and sediment conditions and fishery species, with the long-term aim of predicting fishery resources in real time and collecting information on species diversity, abundance, and distribution. Second, a "Healthy Fish Project" was promoted to counter natural disasters and fish disease problems with the development of vaccines against viruses and bacteria, eventually allowing for a decrease in the use of antibiotics and the production of notably healthier fish in the 2000s. Third, a systematic management model was developed to help with preparations for decreases in the total number of fishermen and increases in the proportion of elderly fishermen in the fishery industry using the development of automatic fishing aquaculture systems and short-chain systems. We could learn from the Norwegian model of fisheries bio-resources, management and could adopt it for the preparation of fishery bio-resources management policy for South Korean coastal areas in the near future.

AB  - The spread of pathogens from farmed salmon is a conservation concern for wild Pacific salmon in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Three pathogens are prevalent in farmed Atlantic salmon in BC, spill over to wild Pacific salmon, and are linked to negative impacts on wild salmon: Piscine orthoreovirus, <i>Tenacibaculum</i> spp., and sea lice (<i>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</i>). Molecular screening of infectious agents in farmed and wild salmon and environmental DNA highlights a further 4 agents that are likely elevated near salmon farms and 37 that co-occur in wild and farmed salmon. Pathogens likely affect wild salmon indirectly by mediating migration, competition, and predation. Current net-pen aquaculture practices pose these risks to numerous populations of all species of wild salmon in BC, most of which are not covered in Government of Canada science and advisory reports. Climate change, pathogen evolution, and changes to disease management and aquaculture regulations will influence future risks.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Sustainability concerns associated with protein sources and currently used fishmeal and plant‐based meal have necessitated the quests for novel sustainable ingredients for use in aquafeeds. Yeasts have been proposed as sustainable ingredients particularly because of their potential to valorise non‐food lignocellulosic biomass into valuable protein resources. Prior to now, extensive studies exist on the role of yeast cell wall components in modulating health responses of fish. However, research on its use as a major protein source in fish diets is still in its infancy. The current review collates, synthesises and discusses the prospects of five major yeast species as future protein ingredients with respect to their nutritional adequacy in fish. Nutritional quality of <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Cyberlindnera jadinii</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Kluyveromyces marxianus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Blastobotrys adeninivorans</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Wickerhamomyces anomalus</jats:italic> and their use as replacement for fishmeal and soy protein in the diets of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout are discussed based on three protein quality indices: chemical score, essential amino acid index and ideal protein concept based on the first limiting amino acids, methionine. The crude protein contents of yeast (40–55%) are lower than that of fishmeal, but comparable with soya bean meal. Compared to fishmeal, the different yeast species have favourable amino acid profiles, except for methionine, lysine, arginine and phenylalanine which are the frequently limiting essential amino acids in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout. This review also presents future area of research and emphasise the need for large‐scale production of yeast at competitive price to constitute a feasible replacement for fishmeal and soy protein in aquaculture.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract This paper aims to explore the extent to which the Circular Economy (CE) concept has been implemented in the aquafeed manufacturing industry. The issues surrounding this industry are pertinent to the resource inefficiency concerns, involving waste generation from aquatic species; resource scarcity including water, energy and overfishing; and pollution as a result of aquafeed production. Due to the growth in the aquaculture sector, the demand for raw materials increases rapidly, creating a high dependency on resources derived from the marine catchment. Our research found that (1) CE has so far merely been translated into a practical implementation by means of the conversion of food waste and by-products to replace fish meal; (2) the circularity assessment methods in aquafeed industry are lacking; and (3) indicators to measure CE in the aquafeed industry is not apparent in the literature. A conceptual framework has been synthesized to incorporate the theoretical lenses of Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV) and Dynamic Capabilities (DC). The framework describes the relationships that exist across the NRBV, DC and the principles of CE, relevant to the context of the aquafeed manufacturing industry.

AB  - <jats:p>Aquaculture has a key role in healthy human diets. These organisms constitute several nutrients such as proteins, fats, and numerous minerals. To be able to mass-produce whilst conserving aquaculture stability, mediating factors are required to enhance the fishes’ immunity, environment, and growth rate. The use of medicinal herbs to increase immune response has been discussed in various studies. In this study, the effect of selected herbs (<jats:italic>Aloe vera</jats:italic>, garlic, echinacea, peppermint, and thyme) on growth rate have been classified and reviewed. In this manner, using such herbs to enhance aquaculture seems beneficial as herbs are a natural and harmless means that can be added to animal diets. It was observed that all studies that analyzed growth rate parameters such as specific growth rate and percent growth rate depicted that increased weight and growth rate were significant, justifying the beneficial use of selected herbs as growth promotors in aquaculture.</jats:p>

AB  - This chapter presents a method to assess the carbon footprint and edible protein content Energy Return On Investment ratio (ep-EROI) of one of the most important and representative fish species, namely, turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) cultivated in Spain under an intensive aquaculture regime. The analysis was performed considering a cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment (LCA). To do so, representative hatcheries, nurseries and turbot farms were inventoried in detail. The relative contribution to overall greenhouse gases (GHG ) emission and cumulative energy demand (CED) were evaluated. The results indicated that intensive turbot farming has significant GHG emission and energy requirements mainly due to electricity and feed requirements. The subsystem related with hatching and nursing reports the highest contribution to the impacts under study. Regarding the ep-EROI, an average level of 0.38% was obtained for Spanish turbot, which is considerably low in comparison with other aquaculture species. Results from this study can be used to optimise and promote more sustainable turbot production chains.

AB  - Abstract Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) discharge management limits the development of the aquaculture sector, because RAS do not automatically result in low nutrient emissions. Research has helped develop discharge management systems such as wetlands and woodchip bioreactors that have been adopted by Danish commercial model trout farms. To further develop the Danish concept, we have modelled and built a novel “zero-discharge” recirculating aquaculture system with an annual capacity of approximately 14 tonnes. The aim of this paper is to describe the entire concept and present the results from the start-up phase of the whole system. The concept includes the treatment of RAS effluent (overflow and sludge supernatant) using a hybrid solution of a woodchip bioreactor, constructed vertical wetland, and sand infiltration. Using this three-step process, the nitrate, phosphorus, and organic matter effluent are decreased to acceptable levels to reuse the water in the RAS process reducing the need for new raw water. In the first nine months of operation, a water treatment field was used as an end-of-pipe treatment to ensure the water was safe to recirculate for fish. During the winter, the water temperature dropped to 2.7 degrees in the sand filter, but the frost did not reach the water levels in any of the treatment processes. It therefore appears that a hybrid solution can operate sufficiently even in winter conditions. In the first year of operation, a woodchip bioreactor can remove 97 % of the nitrate, although the slow start-up of the RAS caused the bioreactor to be N-limited. On average, 79 % and 92 % of the inflow phosphate concentration was removed in the woodchip bioreactor and the entire hybrid treatment field respectively. The wetland and sand filter removed organic matter sufficiently (35 %), but because of the longer than designed actual water residence, it leached from the bioreactor more than was expected. Further experimentation is needed to identify the financial applicability and performance during higher feeding rates.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Both the aquaculture industry and eco‐certification of aquaculture have grown significantly over the past 20 years, but the extent to which aquaculture eco‐certification is effective in creating positive environmental and societal outcomes is uncertain. Therefore, a scoping review of research on the effectiveness of eco‐certification in improving aquaculture sustainability outcomes, based on systematic search and inclusion criteria, was conducted. Challenges in producing sustainability outcomes through eco‐certification were identified, including (1) choosing which components of sustainability to reflect in eco‐certification criteria, (2) the risk of limiting improvements in sustainability by labelling a product ‘sustainable’, (3) accounting for different spatial scales of aquaculture effects, and (4) designing and applying sustainability criteria that work across different local environments. Potential approaches to these challenges include applying an ecosystem services framework to the identification of issues that could be addressed by eco‐certification criteria, supporting continuous improvement of industry best practices, incorporating criteria related to the far‐field effects of aquaculture, and recognising and accounting for the impact of local conditions on farming and eco‐certification. Although alternate governance approaches may be better suited to ensuring improved sustainability outcomes, potential improvements to eco‐certification criteria and processes are presented as opportunities to match the effectiveness of eco‐certification in creating positive sustainability outcomes to its success in creating a market for eco‐certified farmed seafood. However, some of these improvements may require the addition of criteria or complexity within the eco‐certification process, and their impact on market outcomes, particularly the participation of producers, should be considered.</jats:p>

AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine the choice of currency for Norwegian salmon exporters. The choice of invoicing currency will affect prices in different markets as well as risk, factors that are increasingly important as the supply chain for salmon is becoming more sophisticated and more transactions mechanisms are introduced. The results indicate that destination-specific market characteristics have impacts as to the choice of invoicing strategy. Norwegian salmon exporters primarily invoice in the export market currency (47% of the exported quantity), but also use a vehicle currency and producer pricing (19%) in a significant number of transactions. The euro is the preferred vehicle currency (18%), closely followed by the US dollar (USD) (16%). The USD is the dominating invoicing currency for exports beyond Europe.

AB  - Piscirickettsia salmonis is the etiological agent of piscirickettsiosis, the most prevalent disease in salmonid species in Chilean salmonids farms. Many bacteria produce N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) as a quorum-sensing signal molecule to regulate gene expression in a cell density-dependent manner, and thus modulate physiological characteristics and several bacterial mechanisms. In this study, a fluorescent biosensor system method and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were combined to detect AHLs produced by P. salmonis. These analyses revealed an emitted fluorescence signal when the biosensor P. putida EL106 (RPL4cep) was co-cultured with both, P. salmonis LF-89 type strain and an EM-90-like strain Ps007, respectively. Furthermore, the production of an AHL-type molecule was confirmed by GC/MS by both P. salmonis strains, which identified the presence of a N-acetyl-L-homoserine Lactone in the supernatant extract. However, It is suggested that an alternate pathway could synthesizes AHLs, which should be address in future experiments in order to elucidate this important bacterial process. To the best of our knowledge, the present report is the first to describe the type of AHLs produced by P. salmonis.

AB  - In less than two decades, Chile moved from a nonexistent salmon aquaculture production to become a world leader. This research examines the role of state institutions in fostering a non-traditional export-led industry in Chile from 1969 to 2016. During this period, Chile experienced a forced transition towards a neoliberal economic model imposed by General Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship and maintained by subsequent democratic governments. The institutional framework set during the dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s shaped actors and processes related to salmon aquaculture and continue to structure the industry. The history of salmon aquaculture development in Chile is marked by a paradox in which the Chilean state, the same that advocates for a neoliberal economy with a minimum state presence, continues to support, promote, finance and define the salmon aquaculture industry direct and indirectly.

AB  - The concept of integrating species into one culture system originates from Asia and the Middle East. Development of integrated aquaculture involving marine bivalves is relatively new, going back to the late 1980s in China and 1990s in the Western world. In this chapter, we present four cases of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) where bivalves are involved in providing regulating services: i) shrimp culture in ponds, ii) cascading pond systems, iii) open-water caged finfish culture and iv) bay-scale culture systems. The bay-scale integrated culture system in Sanggou Bay in China represents commercial IMTA where a range of different regulating services are provided by the bivalves. Bivalves use degraded fragments derived from cultured kelp and organic waste products from fish farming, and play an important role in the ecosystem processes of the bay. The provision of regulating services in shrimp and cascading ponds is evident as the system configurations allow for biogeochemical processing of waste to maximize extraction by the bivalves. The current configurations used in open-water finfish cage culture suggest that adaptation of concepts allowing for control of effluent water, producing longer contact times and increased biogeochemical processing of the waste products, will dominate future IMTA development. If global bivalve culture production is sustained, we will likely see more regulating services from bivalves in IMTA systems, as new opportunities may arise for developing novel IMTA configurations and concepts.

AB  - This article investigates corporate responses to environmental regulation of fish farming in Norway, the world's largest producer and exporter of salmon. We note a puzzling strategic divergence within the industry: whereas small firms have strongly opposed new standards, large and multinational firms have supported or even demanded stricter regulation. Traditional models for business response strategies can explain this divergence only partly. We develop a supplementary, explanatory perspective focusing on company size and predatory opportunities, to show how large and dominant corporate players can use environmental regulation strategically to strengthen their competitive advantages at the expense of small and weaker rivals. This highlights a neglected dimension of regulatory effects and motives behind corporate demand for strict and costly standards. It aso shows how environmental regulations may cause trade-offs with local development concerns, relevant to other natural resource-based sectors evolving from smaller-scale production towards full-fledged industrialization.

AB  - Salmon is the most consumed farmed seafood in the EU and there is no indication that demand will abate. Yet salmon aquaculture’s environmental impacts are significant, and its future is likely to be shaped by demands of increased but at the same time more sustainable production. This study developed an integrated theoretical framework based on the multi-level perspective (MLP) and a global value chain (GVC) governance framework and applied it to the global farmed salmon value chain. The objective was to provide insights on the most likely transition pathway towards sustainability based on industry and expert perspectives. The perceptions on challenges and drivers of change, were gathered through focus groups and in-depth interviews, and fitted to the integrated framework to facilitate the transition pathway analysis. Viewing the qualitative findings in the context of the MLP framework provided information about the current workings of the system, the drivers of change in the socio-technical landscape and niche-innovations and their potential to challenge or enhance the current system and thus indicated possible system transitions. To emphasize the role of industry actors in shaping the future of the salmon value chain, the analysis was strengthened using the GVC model which added information about power relations, signaling the ability of system actors to motivate or resist change. The findings indicate that, due to resistance in the regime and the fact that niche-innovations are not yet sufficiently developed, the farmed salmon value chain will continue to be predominated by traditional sea-based aquaculture but that there will be a gradual shift towards more diversity in terms of production methods in response to landscape pressures. The discussion addresses sustainability challenges and policy implications for the farmed salmon value chain and highlights the need for a food system perspective.

AB  - The arthropod salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is a major threat to Atlantic salmon aquaculture and wild salmonids. Essentially like in monoculture, very high concentrations of susceptible hosts may result in high reproduction and severe production of waves of pests. Pest management is crucial both for fish health and protection of wild fish populations from aquaculture influence. Various methods have been utilized to control salmon lice infestations, such as pesticide use, physical treatments, construction modifications, fallowing, breeding, vaccination, and biological control. Most of the methods are partially successful, but none completely fulfills the necessary pest control strategy. Like in agriculture, lice/pest management is an arms race, but the marine environment makes it even more difficult to precisely hit the target pest and avoid unintended negative effects on general wildlife. In this study, we provide an overview of the methods and principles of salmon lice management and address current possibilities and limitations. We also highlight the potential of emerging strategies and enabling technologies, like genome editing, RNA interference, and machine learning, in arthropod management in aquaculture.

AB  - Aims This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity and efficacy of synthetic host defence peptides (HDPs), alone or in combination with florfenicol (FFC), oxytetracycline (OTC) or thiamphenicol (TAP), against different pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased fish. Methods and results Solid-phase synthesis, purification and characterization of several HDPs were performed manually, using the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protecting group in different resins and via high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. The in vitro cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity of HDPs, FFC, OTC and TAP against Nile tilapia red blood cells (RBCs) and relevant fish pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas, Citrobacter, Edwardsiella, Streptococcus, Lactococcus and Vibrio) was determined using the haemolysis assay and broth microdilution method, respectively. The checkerboard assay was used to evaluate the synergy between the most active HDPs and other antimicrobials against the tested strains. MUC 7 12-mer, FFC, OTC and TAP were not cytotoxic to Nile tilapia RBCs, in all tested concentrations. LL-37, (p-BthTX-I)2 and Hylin-a1 were not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 78·13, 19·53 and 9·77 μg ml-1 , respectively. HDPs demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration ≤31·25 µg ml-1 ) against Aeromonas jandaei (KR-12-a5), Citrobacter freundii (Kr-12-a5; (p-BthTX-I)2 ; LL-37; and Hylin a1), Streptococcus agalactiae (Hylin a1; (p-BthTX-I)2 and LL-37), Lactococcus garviae (Hylin a1), and Vibrio fluvialis (KR-12-a5). The combinations of (p-BthTX-I)2 with TAP and LL-37 with FFC showed synergistic activity against C. freundii (fractional inhibitory concentration index of 0·25 and 0·50, respectively). Conclusions Synthetic HDPs have the potential as a good treatment option for bacterial diseases in aquaculture. Significance and impact of the study The in vivo effectiveness of synthetic HDPs such as KR-12-a5; LL-37; (p-BthTX-I)2 and Hylin a1 can be tested alone or in combination with conventional antimicrobials as a treatment option to reduce the use of antimicrobials in aquaculture.

AB  - Origin and age was determined for individual fish caught in offshore catches of Atlantic salmon stocks (Salmo salar L.) in the Baltic Sea over the years 2000–2009. DNA microsatellite loci and smolt age were used to probabilistically assign returning spawners to their stock of origin. Data for this study were based on approximately 2600 catch samples of the five most common wild and four sea-ranched, hatchery-reared stocks. Spawning age, and sex ratio differed both within and between these wild, and sea-ranched groups. The females were mainly (78.7%) two sea-winters old and the males usually (68.7%) only one sea-winter old. In both sexes, the mean age at maturity was lower in the hatchery-reared, sea-ranched stocks than in naturally reproducing stocks. In the 2000s, there was a weak decreasing trend in the male spawning age, but not in that of females. The sex-ratio of the spawners was female dominant in the naturally reproducing stocks, but male dominant in hatchery-reared stocks. Published historical data from two of the same rivers suggest that the majority of males were multi-sea-winter spawners in the 1930s, and variation in the age distribution of the spawners has become narrower and skewed towards a younger age in the present data (2000–2009) compared to the earlier situation.

AB  - Globally, one-sixth of landings from marine capture fisheries are destined for the production of fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), which are currently overwhelming utilized by fed aquaculture. Many different species are used globally for the production of FMFO, but little concern has been given to the divergent environmental and ecological impacts of FMFO products based on species, ecosystem and fishing gear used in their capture. We evaluated the variable environmental performance of FMFO products from a wide range of fisheries whose products are either primarily intended for reduction or whose by-products are redirected to reduction. Assessed fisheries accounted for 44% of global reduction fishery landings in 2014. Analysis was conducted on the basis of two measures: the carbon footprint (i.e., greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions) and the marine footprint (i.e., primary production required [PPR]). We found large differences between the impacts of FMFO products across the 18 reduction fisheries examined. Cumulatively, we estimate that reduction fisheries emitted 4.6 million tonnes of CO2-e GHGs in 2014, and appropriated over 4% of primary production in some ecosystems, demonstrating a non-trivial impact. As demand for aquafeeds grow, the sustainable sourcing of raw material inputs will be of great importance. Results here suggest that the source of FMFO inputs can have dramatic effects on the environmental performance of fish feeds and fed aquaculture. We recommend further research on the environmental and ecological impacts of food production systems, and specifically to understand these results in relation to global production and sustainable boundaries.

AB  - Although chemotherapeutics are used to treat infections in farmed fish, knowledge on how they alter host physiology is limited. Here, we elucidated the physiological consequences of repeated exposure to the potent oxidative chemotherapeutic peracetic acid (PAA) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts. Fish were exposed to the oxidant for 15 (short exposure) or 30 (long exposure) minutes every 15 days over 45 days. Unexposed fish served as the control. Thereafter, the ability of the remaining fish to handle a secondary stressor was investigated. Periodic chemotherapeutic exposure did not affect production performance, though survival was lower in the PAA-treated groups than in the control. Increased ventilation, erratic swimming, and a loss of balance were common behavioural manifestations during the oxidant exposure. The plasma reactive oxygen species levels increased in the PAA-treated groups, particularly after the third exposure, suggesting an alteration in the systemic oxidative stress status. Plasma indicators for internal organ health were affected to a certain degree, with the changes mainly observed after the second and third exposures. Metabolomics disclosed that the oxidant altered several circulating metabolites. Inosine and guanosine were the two metabolites significantly affected by the oxidative stressor, regardless of exposure time. A microarray analysis revealed that the gills and liver were more responsive to the oxidant than the skin, with the gills being the most sensitive. Moreover, the magnitude of the transcriptomic modifications depended on the exposure duration. A functional analysis showed that genes involved in immunity and ribosomal functions were significantly affected in the gills. In contrast, genes crucial for the oxidation-reduction process were mainly targeted in the liver. Skin mucus proteomics uncovered that the changes in the mucosal proteome were dependent on exposure duration and that the oxidant interfered with ribosome-related processes. Mucosal mapping revealed gill mucous cell hypertrophy after the second and third exposures, although the skin morphological parameters remained unaltered. Lastly, repeated oxidant exposures did not impede the ability of the fish to mount a response to a secondary stressor. This study provides insights into how a chemical oxidative stressor alters salmon physiology at both the systemic and mucosal levels. This knowledge will be pivotal in developing an evidence-driven approach to the use of oxidative therapeutics in fish, with some of the molecules and pathways identified as potential biomarkers and targets for assessing the physiological cost of these treatments.

AB  - Evolutionary principles are now routinely incorporated into medicine and agriculture. Examples include the design of treatments that slow the evolution of resistance by weeds, pests, and pathogens, and the design of breeding programs that maximize crop yield or quality. Evolutionary principles are also increasingly incorporated into conservation biology, natural resource management, and environmental science. Examples include the protection of small and isolated populations from inbreeding depression, the identification of key traits involved in adaptation to climate change, the design of harvesting regimes that minimize unwanted life-history evolution, and the setting of conservation priorities based on populations, species, or communities that harbor the greatest evolutionary diversity and potential. The adoption of evolutionary principles has proceeded somewhat independently in these different fields, even though the underlying fundamental concepts are the same. We explore these fundamental concepts under four main themes: variation, selection, connectivity, and eco-evolutionary dynamics. Within each theme, we present several key evolutionary principles and illustrate their use in addressing applied problems. We hope that the resulting primer of evolutionary concepts and their practical utility helps to advance a unified multidisciplinary field of applied evolutionary biology.

AB  - China is the biggest provider of aquaculture products, and the industry is still growing rapidly. Further development of the sector will affect the provision of ecosystem services that maintain the livelihood of local populations. In particular, the current size and growth rate of China’s mariculture has raised many environmental concerns, but very few studies of this sector have been conducted to date. Here, we report the resource use in the production of six main Chinese mariculture products (Larimichthys crocea, Apostichopus japonicus, Haliotis spp., Laminaria japonica, Gracilaria spp., Porphyra spp.), taking the city of Ningde as a case study. We used the life cycle assessment framework and the Cumulated Exergy Demand indicator to quantify resource use, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation where model uncertainty was included using various methods. The mean exergy demand values of the production of one live-weight ton of large yellow croaker, sea cucumber, abalone, laminaria, gracilaria, and porphyra are 106 GJ eq., 65 GJ eq., 126 GJ eq., 0.25 GJ eq., 1.55 GJ eq., and 0.98 GJ eq., respectively. For animal products, 45–90% of the impacts come from the feed requirements, while in seaweed production, 83–99% of the impacts are linked to the fuel used in operation and maintenance activities. Policies oriented toward efficient resource management in the mariculture sector thus should take the farm design, input management, and spatial planning of marine areas as the main targets to guide current practices into more sustainable ones in the future. Improvements in all those aspects can effectively increase resource efficiency in local mariculture production and additionally reduce other environmental impacts both locally and globally.

AB  - The effect of chrysophanic acid (CA) (2, 4, and 8 mg kg-1) on the immunity and immune-related gene profile of Catla catla against Aeromonas hydrophila is reported. In both control and treated groups fed with 2 mg kg-1 (2 CA), the phagocytosis, hemolytic, myeloperoxidase content, and superoxide anion production decreased significantly between 6th and 8th weeks, whereas when fed with 4 mg kg-1 CA (4 CA) the H2O2 production and nitric oxide synthase increased significantly between 4th and 8th week. When fed with 2 CA and 4 CA diets, the total protein, bactericidal, and antibody titer increased significantly from the 4th week onwards. When fed with 2 CA, the IL-1β and IL-10 mRNA expression of head kidney leucocytes were significant between weeks 6 and 8. The expressions of toll-like receptors significantly increased when fed with a 4 CA diet from 4th week onwards. The 4 CA group significantly increased in TNF-α, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (NOD), which influences protein expression, after the 4th week. The mRNA transcription of MHCI, lysozyme-chicken and goose type expressions significantly increased in 4 CA group within the 4th week. In summary, the dietary administration of 4 mg kg-1 of CA (4 CA) provides better immunity and enhances the up-regulation of immune-related genes in Catla against A. hydrophila.

AB  - The capacity of marine and coastal ecosystems to sustain seafood production and consumption is seldom accounted for. In this article, we review estimates of marine and coastal areas appropriated by aquaculture and fisheries for seafood production, and also by cities and whole regions for seafood consumption. The appropriated ecosystem area—the ecological footprint—ranges from negligible to as much as 50 000 ha/ha activity, largely depending on the methods of farming and fishing. The area for waste assimilation ranges from 2 to 275 ha/ha seafood production. The human population of the Baltic Sea region (85 × 106 people) appropriate for their seafood consumption an area of marine ecosystems that corresponds to two additional Baltic Sea areas. Twenty percent of the global human population (1.1 × 109 people), living in large cities worldwide, appropriate 25% of the globally available area of productive coastal and marine ecosystems. The capacity of marine and coastal ecosystems to produce seafood is not included in the signals that guide economic development. Practices that make use of this capacity without degrading it have to be developed and protected from economic and social driving forces that create incentives for misuse of coastal and marine ecosystems.

AB  - Microplastics, an emerging pollutant, have garnered widespread attention due to potential repercussions on human health and the environment. Given the critical role of seafood in food security, growing concerns about microplastics might be detrimental to meeting future global food demand. This study employed a discrete choice experiment to investigate Chilean consumers' preferences for technology aimed at mitigating microplastic levels in mussels. Using a between-subjects design with information treatments, we examined the impact of informing consumers about potential human health and environmental effects linked to microplastics pollution on their valuation for the technology. We found that the information treatments increased consumers' willingness to pay for mussels. Specifically, consumers were willing to pay a premium of around US$ 4 for 250 g of mussel meat with a 90 % depuration efficiency certification. The provision of health impact information increased the price premium by 56 %, while the provision of environmental information increased it by 21 %. Furthermore, combined health and environmental information significantly increased the probability of non-purchasing behavior by 22.8 % and the risk perception of microplastics for human health by 5.8 %. These results emphasized the critical role of information in shaping consumer preferences and provided evidence for validating investment in research and development related to microplastic pollution mitigation measures.

AB  - The extensive use of antibiotics is evident in most of the livestock and aquaculture management for inhibiting pathogen infection. Korean aquaculture depends on the usage of oxy-tetracycline for growing rainbow trout. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the changes in gut bacterial community profiles of rainbow trout exposed to oxy-tetracycline and predict the metabolic functioning of the bacterial community. The gut bacterial community composition of oxy-tetracycline treated fish was assessed by amplicon sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria and comparing with the control group that did not receive any antibiotic. The principle coordinate analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis had shown two distinct clusters that implies the changes in community composition. In phyla level, the relative abundances of Tenericutes and Firmicutes were observed to be significantly higher in oxy-tetracycline treated fish compared to the control. Furthermore, the prediction based metabolic profiling revealed the processes that are affected due to the shift in community profiles. For example, metabolic functioning of membrane efflux system, amino acid metabolism and glycolysis were significantly higher in oxy-tetracycline treated fish compared to the control. This study describes alteration in gut bacterial community composition and potential metabolic profiles of the community that might be responsible for surviving in antibiotic rich environment.

AB  - Piscirickettsiosis is the main cause of mortality in salmonids of commercial importance in Chile, which is caused by Piscirickettsia salmonis, a Gram-negative, γ-proteobacteria that can produce biofilm as one of its virulence factors. The Chilean salmon industry uses large amounts of antibiotics to control piscirickettsiosis outbreaks, which has raised concern about its environmental impact and the potential to induce antibiotic resistance. Thus, the use of phytogenic feed additives (PFA) with antibacterial activity emerges as an interesting alternative to antimicrobials. Our study describes the antimicrobial action of an Andrographis paniculate-extracted PFA on P. salmonis planktonic growth and biofilm formation. We observed complete inhibition of planktonic and biofilm growth with 500 and 400 μg/mL of PFA for P. salmonis LF-89 and EM-90-like strains, respectively. Furthermore, 500 μg/mL of PFA was bactericidal for both evaluated bacterial strains. Sub-inhibitory doses of PFA increase the transcript levels of stress (groEL), biofilm (pslD), and efflux pump (acrB) genes for both P. salmonis strains in planktonic and sessile conditions. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the antibacterial effect of PFA against P. salmonis in vitro, highlighting the potential of PFA as an alternative to control Piscirickettsiosis.

AB  - <jats:p>Without insights into the threats affecting species across their distributions and throughout their annual cycles, effective conservation management cannot be applied. The Whenua Hou diving petrel <jats:italic>Pelecanoides whenuahouensis</jats:italic> (WHDP) is a Critically Endangered small seabird whose offshore habits and threats are poorly understood. We tracked WHDPs year-round in 2015/16, 2017/18, and 2018/19 using global location-sensing immersion loggers to identify offshore distribution, movements, behaviour, and overlap with commercial fishing effort. During the breeding period, WHDPs ranged from southern Aotearoa (New Zealand) to Maukahuka (Auckland Islands). After breeding, WHDPs migrated southwest towards the Polar Front south of Australia, exhibited clockwise movements, and returned to their breeding grounds via the Subantarctic Front. During the non-breeding period, WHDPs exhibited extreme aquatic behaviour and spent &gt;95% of their time on, or under, water. The core areas used consistently during breeding and non-breeding periods warrant listing as Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas. Spatiotemporal overlap of commercial fishing effort with breeding distributions was considerable, in contrast with non-breeding distributions. Spatiotemporal management of anthropogenic activity around the breeding colony during the breeding period could help protect WHDPs, but such measures should be subjected to a structured decision-making framework. Our results illustrate the importance of year-round studies to inform conservation of marine species.</jats:p>

AB  - In assessing the future expansion of aquaculture in coastal-ocean environments, most studies focus only on the constraint posed by the local environmental assimilative capacity. In open-ocean environments, however, the assimilative capacity is difficult to gauge. We develop an alternative economic approach for projecting the growth of the open-ocean aquaculture industry. We evaluate equilibria in the market for seafood, where the product may be supplied either by a wild-harvest fishery or open-ocean aquaculture or both. In our framework, the net demand for farmed fish determines the size of the aquaculture industry and, in turn, the levels of pollution discharges. We illustrate our approach with a case study of a groundfish fishery and the proposed open-ocean aquaculture of Atlantic cod in New England. We find that, for a range of competitive production costs for aquaculture, the optimal industry structure would comprise both a wild-harvest fishery and aquaculture.

AB  - This study was performed to optimize the analytical method for multi-residues of 60 compounds in flatfish samples. Three sample preparation methods were tested to identify the optimal recovery conditions for target analytes. As a result, 10 mL of water/acetonitrile (1:4, v/v) was used to extract analytes from fish samples. For purification, C18 and 10 mL of acetonitrile saturated hexane were used to treat the samples. After evaporation and reconstitution, the fish samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The proposed method was validated according to the CODEX guidelines (CAC/GL-71). Our results showed the recoveries of 73.2%–115% and coefficients of variation of 1.6%–22.1%. The limit of quantification was 0.0005–0.005 mg/kg in the fishery products. In analysis of real samples, no samples exceeded the limit of quantification. This analytical method can be used for multi-residue screening and confirmation of the residues of veterinary drugs in fishery products.

AB  - Abstract This paper uses an environmentally extended input-output model of the Irish economy to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic output multipliers in 2010 for two aquatic (aquaculture products and sea fisheries) and five land-based livestock products (beef and veal, sheep meat, pig meat, poultry meat, and dairy products). Moreover, the Global Value Chain (GVC) framework is adopted to qualitatively understand the structure of Irish food sectors and identify segments of the food value chains with the greatest emissions efficiency and economic potential. Aquaculture is found to have the highest output multiplier and a low to medium carbon footprint compared to pastoral livestock products (beef and veal, sheep meat, dairy). The direct and indirect economic benefits of the aquaculture sector along with the relatively low carbon footprint suggest that additional benefits from an expansion of Ireland's aquaculture sector can be gained. However, aquaculture is energy intensive, and therefore production requires the efficient use of energy and resources, and the employment of low carbon technologies that strengthen aquaculture's sustainability.

AB  - Hatcheries are vital to many salmon fisheries, with inherent risks and rewards. While hatcheries can increase the returns of adult fish, the demographic and evolutionary consequences for natural populations interacting with hatchery fish on spawning grounds remain unclear. This study examined the impacts of stray hatchery-origin pink salmon on natural population productivity and resilience. We explored temporal assortative mating dynamics using a quantitative genetic model that assumed the only difference between hatchery- and natural-origin adults was their return timing to natural spawning grounds. This model was parameterized with empirical data from an intensive multi-generational study of hatchery-wild interactions in the world's largest pink salmon fisheries enhancement program located in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Across scenarios of increasing hatchery fish presence on spawning grounds, our findings underscore a trade-off between demographic enhancement and preservation of natural population diversity. While enhancement bolstered natural population sizes towards local carrying capacities, hatchery introgression reduced variation in adult return timing by up to 20%. Results indicated that hatchery-origin alleles can rapidly assimilate into natural populations, despite the reduced fitness of hatchery fish attributable to phenotypic mismatches. These findings elucidate the potential for long-term demographic and evolutionary consequences arising from specific hatchery-wild interactions, emphasizing the need for management strategies that balance demographic enhancement with the conservation of natural diversity.

AB  - Most fish breeding programs aim at improving growth rate and include feed conversion ratio (FCR) neither in the breeding goal nor in the selection index, although decreasing FCR is known to increase farm profit and decrease environmental impacts. This is because FCR is difficult to measure in fish that live in groups and FCR is assumed to have a favourable (negative) genetic correlation with growth, although the magnitude of this correlation is unknown. We investigated the effect of the genetic correlation between growth and FCR on the economic and environmental responses of a two-trait breeding goal (growth and FCR), compared to a single-trait breeding goal (growth only). Next, we evaluated the weights to assign to growth and FCR in a two-trait breeding goal to maximize sustainability of fish production. We used pseudo-best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) index calculations to simulate a breeding program for sea bass. For the single-trait breeding goal, the trait in the breeding goal and in the index was thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and for the two-trait breeding goal, the traits in the breeding goal were TGC and FCR and the traits in the index were TGC and percentage of fat in the dorsal muscle (an indirect measure of FCR). We simulated responses to selection for genetic and phenotypic correlations between TGC and FCR ranging from 0 to − 0.8. Then, in the two-trait breeding goal, we calculated the economic return and the change in eutrophication when using economic values (EV) or environmental values (ENV). When the genetic correlation between TGC and FCR was lower than − 0.45, we found major differences in economic returns and in eutrophication between single and two-trait breeding programs. At a correlation of − 0.25, the two-trait breeding goal based on EV increased economic return by 25% compared to the single-trait breeding goal, while using ENV decreased eutrophication by 1.34% per ton of fish produced after one generation of selection. The genetic correlation between TGC and FCR affects the magnitude of economic losses due to omitting FCR in the breeding program. In addition, the genetic correlation affects the importance of choosing EV or ENV to reduce eutrophication and increase profit.

AB  - Abstract To address global food demand and sustainability challenges, aquaculture has appeared as an essential element in food systems, and an increasing number of national aquaculture policies have emerged over the past decades. However, several of these policies have failed because of an often-argued inability to anticipate their far-reaching implications on environmental and socio-economic variables. To tackle this gap, we propose a step-wise framework to assess the national environmental impacts from aquaculture industries with a prospective and systemic approach. Starting from identifying policy-based national targets, the methodology relies on economic equilibrium modeling to develop realistic future-oriented scenarios of the aquaculture sector, and couples them with life cycle assessment principles. To evidence its operability, we apply the framework to two distinct case countries: Norway and Singapore. Beyond our key findings from the analyses of the policies in both countries, we observed that feed production and usage are important drivers of impacts, hence calling for new and more environmentally-friendly feed options. Our results additionally show that the development of aquaculture following existing governmental policies may not directly reduce greenhouse gases emissions and, hence, not support climate change mitigation objectives. These findings should however be cautioned as potential shifts of diets due to the increasing seafood availability might occur, leading to indirect environmental benefits. We therefore advocate the further expansion of our framework to cover the entire food system, so it can integrate such indirect effects. Meanwhile, we recommend its interim application to support policy-making and help move towards more environmentally sustainable aquaculture systems.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria along the food chain is crucial for the assessment of human health risks. Uncritical use of antibiotics in farming over years can be one of the main reasons for increased antibiotic resistance in bacteria. In this study, we aimed to classify 222 presumptive <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates originating from a salmon processing environment, and to examine the phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance profiles of these isolates. Of all the analyzed isolates 68% belonged to <i>Pseudomonas</i>, and the most abundant species were <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, <i>Pseudomonas azotoformans</i>, <i>Pseudomonas gessardii</i>, <i>Pseudomonas libanesis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas lundensis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas cedrina</i> and <i>Pseudomonas extremaustralis</i> based on sequencing of the <i>rpoD</i> gene. As many as 27% of <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates could not be classified to species level. Phenotypic susceptibility analysis by disc diffusion method revealed a high level of resistance towards the antibiotics ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and the fish farming relevant antibiotics florfenicol and oxolinic acid among the <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates. Whole genome sequencing and subsequent analysis of AMR determinants by ResFinder and CARD revealed that no isolates harbored any acquired resistance determinants, but all isolates carried variants of genes known from <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to be involved in multidrug efflux pump systems.

AB  - Abstract We investigated trophic transfer efficiency in the pelagic food chain of deep, oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany) by analyses of the primary, secondary, and fish production. Primary production between April and November 2000 was estimated at 78 g C m −2 , pelagic secondary production at 14 g C m −2 , and production of the main planktivorous fish species [European cisco, Coregonus albula (L.)] at 0.77 g C m −2 . Thus, trophic transfer efficiency between primary and pelagic secondary production was around 18%, whereas between pelagic and fish production around 6%. The high efficiency at the first step of the chain is discussed to be due to the high food quality in oligotrophic lakes due to the dominance of Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae rich in essential fatty acids. In turn, the relatively low trophic transfer efficiency between the secondary and the fish production is mainly explained by the avoidance of calanoid copepods as food source by the ciscoes. Concerning the trophic transfer efficiency, results from this study support the general assumption of a 10% transfer between neighbouring trophic levels within ecosystems.

AB  - The demand for animal protein, especially fish, is growing fast, perhaps due to the rapid expansion of populations, increases in income and changes in eating habits and life styles. Capture fisheries, which supply over 70% of the fish for human consumption in Malaysia, are over-exploited or depleted. Their yields have become stagnant over the last few decades and in some cases have even declined. Nevertheless, aquaculture has the potential to meet these challenges if practised well. This study therefore aims to estimate the technical efficiency of pond culture systems using data envelopment analysis (DEA). In addition, it investigates the determinants of technical efficiency by employing an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. The estimated technical efficiency of pond culture was found to be 0.86, which means that the fish farmers in our sample could reach full technical efficiency through reducing their input usage by 14% with the current level of technology to produce the same output levels. The results of the OLS regression indicate that farmers’ age, experience, extension training and water management have positive and statistically significant impacts on technical efficiency. Information on water management practices could be passed on by extension agents to inefficient farms to assist them in catching up with the farms demonstrating best practice.

The results from the low feed supply group suggest insufficient nutrient supply as most ingested C was allocated to respiration (84%), while most N was expended on uptake for growth (45%), and ingested P was either taken up for growth (58%) or spent on defecation (34%). Overall, nutrient uptake reflected the smolt sludge composition rather than nutrient requirements for <jats:italic>H. diversicolor</jats:italic>, which may be a short-term effect and needs to be investigated further. The flow of nutrients was strongly affected by feed supply, as ingestion, defecation, excretion, and uptake for growth were significantly higher in the high feed supply group than in the low feed supply group.</jats:p></jats:sec>

AB  - The aquaculture industry relies on federal investments to stimulate aquaculture research and development (R&D). We conducted this study to track federal spending for aquaculture using a large database of 2957 US federal research grants awarded from 1990 to 2015. During that period, 1.04 billion US dollars (USD) were spent on aquaculture research, with 919 million USD from federal agencies and 123 million USD in matching funds. By comparison, over the same time frame, the US Department of Agriculture's R&D spending was 41 billion USD. Federal grant funding for aquaculture had a 37-fold return on investment since 2000. Microalgae, oysters, salmon and trout, catfish, and shrimp received the most grant support, and the most common topics/disciplines were aquaculture production sciences, aquatic animal health and disease, genetics and breeding, and nutrition. Our findings can be used to identify research gaps and inform federal policy, grant making, and budget allocation.

AB  - <jats:p>Deep-sea cage aquaculture (DSCA) is an important way to expand new space for marine aquaculture, promote the transformation and upgrade of the fishery industry, and optimize the structure of marine aquaculture. Using the panel data of DSCA in China’s coastal areas from 2013 to 2021, this study constructs the SBM–Malmquist model to measure the DSCA production efficiency and analyzes its total factor productivity. The results show that the overall DSCA production efficiency exhibited an increasing trend in spite of a sharp decline in 2019. The efficiency exhibited regional differences, being the strongest in the Bohai Sea region, followed by in the Yellow Sea, the South China Sea, and the East China Sea regions. The overall total factor productivity remained generally stable, although a large fluctuation occurred between 2019 and 2021. Both pure technological efficiency and scale efficiency promoted the total factor productivity in 2019–2021, while the efficiency of technological changes in societal aspects declined. This study shows that the DSCA production efficiency is significantly influenced by input factors such as labor and capital investment. In addition, natural disasters inhibit the improvement of the production efficiency to some extent.</jats:p>

This article looks at the challenges of conserving marine biocultural diversity by investigating the unique heritage of marine salmon fisheries through a case study of a small group of marine fisheries in Norway, still fishing for Atlantic salmon <jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic> L. Tight relationships between declining natural resources and daily struggles to keep cultural heritage alive are highlighted through theoretical perspectives of social identity and local ecological knowledge. The theoretical lens of social identity contributes to better understanding tensions between scientific and local knowledge by bringing forward social categorisation, polarisation and power relations as drivers of conflicts. Involvement of local communities and respect for their cultural heritage, knowledge and practices can assist in more effective management and governance of multifunctional biocultural landscapes, and contribute to their resilience and adaptability.</jats:p>

AB  - Food security and biodiversity conservation are closely interconnected challenges to be addressed to achieve a sustainable food system on a global scale. Due to the complex nature of food production and consumption system, quantifying the impacts of food supply chains on biodiversity is challenging. Life cycle assessment (LCA) allows for systematically addressing environmental impacts along supply chains, representing a reference methodology that can be applied for assessing food systems. In the present study, 32 representative food products of consumption in the European Union (EU) were selected and their environmental impacts calculated through a process-based LCA. The potential contribution of EU food consumption to the current biodiversity decline has been evaluated adopting both midpoint and endpoint indicators. A comparison of the impact drivers was performed. Meat products, the underpinning land use for agricultural purposes, and climate change represent the main hotspots of impacts on biodiversity. Notwithstanding several drivers of biodiversity loss can be accounted for with LCA, the evidence of the increasing biodiversity decline on both a European and a global scale indicates that the assessment system should be further expanded, especially for what concerns refining impact categories such as ecotoxicity, and including resource overexploitation, and impact due to invasive species. This study illustrates: how far the current LCA based impact assessment framework may help to address the drivers of biodiversity loss; which are the main uncertainties associated to results stemming from the application of different endpoint methods; which aspects need to be elaborated further to ensure a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity impacts due to food production and consumption.

AB  - Mortality represents a major challenge in farming of salmon in open sea cages. Production takes place in large cages with up to 200,000 fish and offers no other treatment of individual fish than euthanasia of moribund fish. Improvements need to take place as preventing future problems. The described project was initiated with the objective to develop a standardized system for classification of mortality and losses in aquaculture. The WHO's International Classification of Disease (ICD) has served as a model tool, with adaptation into an animal production system. The system is based on causality with the underlying cause of death as the principal variable to monitor. The system describes the fish-farmer as the primary user, and with additional opportunities for the supply industry, authorities, and research to utilize anonymized data. The classification system is organized with an alphanumeric code in a hierarchical structure with three levels: six main categories, causal subcategories at level 2, and in principle, unlimited underlying causes at level three. The hierarchy allow both registration and retraction of data at each of the three different levels. The proposed code is conceptuated to also allow classification of other losses than mortality, thus being able to monitor the effect of the underlying cause for all areas of losses, including quality downgrading, reduced growth, reduced feed conversions etc. A code covering all areas of losses will enable the fish farmer to monitor the total effect of underlying causes, both in biological and monetary terms. Through systematic monitoring it will be possible to target resources in the direction of losses with the highest impact and the interventions with the highest pay-back. By establishing a unique code, it will further be possible to standardize registrations between area of losses within a company, between companies and regions, and potentially also between countries.

AB  - Abstract In order to assess the effect of dietary phosphorus (P) in reducing vertebral malformations and improving freshwater (FW) performance in triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), both triploid and diploid Atlantic salmon were fed three different dietary P inclusion levels (low: 4.9, medium: 7.7, and high: 9.7 g available P kg−1) from first feeding until smolt. Somatic and skeletal response was assessed at fry (~0.5 g), parr (~5 g) and smolt (~45 g) stages. Triploid parr initially grew faster on the high P diet, while groups fed low P resulted in a significantly higher weight at smolt. Image analysis of double stained Alcian blue and Alizarin red S fry revealed that low P fed triploid fish presented less well mineralised vertebrae, and significantly more malformed vertebrae in both parr and smolt stages following x-ray radiographic assessment. Triploid parr fed high and medium P had similar numbers of malformed vertebrae relative to their diploid counterparts but greater numbers than at smolt. Low P fed triploids had the highest prevalence of jaw and vertebral malformations as well as the highest number of deformed vertebrae in the central caudal vertebral region, which was more pronounced at parr than at smolt. Shorter vertebrae dorso-ventral lengths were observed throughout the spinal column (R1–R4) in parr fed low P and only in the caudal region (R3) at smolt. In parr, both ploidies showed reduced phosphate homeostasis protein fgf23 gene expression in vertebrae when fed low P diets, while triploids showed greater down-regulation of osteogenic factors (alp, opn and igf1r) between diets relative to diploids, suggesting possible greater active suppression of mineralisation and reduced osteogenic potential in triploids. No effects of diet or ploidy on gene expression were evident at smolt. Comparisons between development stages suggest early P supplementation in triploids is crucial for skeletal development. Ultimately, reducing vertebral deformities observed at smolt with higher P supplementation in triploids could contribute towards improving skeletal performance and welfare of the stocks in the marine phase.

AB  - Farmed fish sometimes escape and enter natural environments, where they mix with wild fish populations and can have negative effects. Marking farmed fish is a prerequisite for the identification of the origin of escapees and for guiding technical investigations to determine the cause of an escape event and improve farming practices. We tested transgenerational marking with enriched stable isotopes to assess its effectiveness as an accurate, feasible and cost-effective marking method for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar grown in sea-cage aquaculture. We injected a combination of 7 stable isotopes (134Ba, 135Ba, 136Ba, 137Ba, 86Sr, 87Sr and 26Mg) at 4 different concentrations (2, 0.2, 0.02 and 0.002 μg g−1 broodfish) into the abdominal cavity of female Atlantic salmon broodstock. Marking success was assessed in the otoliths of the resulting yolk sac larvae using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Marking was 100% successful with Ba isotopes at concentrations as low as 0.002 μg and for Sr isotopes at 2 μg, when at least 3 wk had passed between the day of injection and spawning. Our results demonstrate that 63 unique fingerprint marks can be made at a low cost using enriched isotopes of Ba (US$0.0002−0.002 mark−1) and Sr (US$0.05−0.13 mark−1). Compared to other mass marking techniques, transgenerational marking of farmed salmon is an economically feasible method for tracing escapees with similarly low costs to delivery by egg bathing or vaccines, and an order of magnitude or more lower than other conventional marking methods.

AB  - We report how aquaculture may negatively alter a critical phenological trait (developmental rate) linked to sur- vival in wild fish populations. At the southern limit of the species range in eastern North America, the persistence of small Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations may be constrained by interbreeding with farmed salmon that escape regularly from intensive aquaculture facilities. Using a common-garden experimental protocol implemented over an 8-year period, we show that embryos of farmed salmon and multigenerational farmed-wild hybrids (F1 ,F 2, wild backcrosses) had slower developmental rates than those of two regional wild populations. In certain cases, our data suggest that hybrid develop- mental rates are sufficiently mismatched to prevailing environmental conditions that they would have reduced survival in the wild. This implies that repeated farmed-wild interbreeding could adversely affect wild populations. Our results there- fore reaffirm previous recommendations that based on the precautionary principle, improved strategies are needed to pre- vent, or to substantially minimize, escapes of aquaculture fishes into wild environments. Resume´ : Nous demontrons comment l'aquaculture peut affecter negativement un trait phenologique essentiel (le taux de developpement) lieala survie des populations sauvages de poissons. Ala limite sud de l'aire de repartition de l'espece dans l'est de l'Amerique du Nord, la persistance de petites populations de saumons atlantiques (Salmo salar) peut etre res- treinte par des croisements avec des saumons d'elevage qui s'echappent regulierement des installations d'aquaculture in- tensive. Al'aide d'un protocole experimental de jardin commun maintenu sur une periode de 8 annees, nous montrons que les embryons de saumons d'elevage et des hybrides de plusieurs generations de saumons sauvages et eleves (retrocroise- ments en nature de F1 et de F2) ont des taux de developpement plus lents que les poissons de deux populations regionales sauvages. Dans certains cas, nos donnees indiquent que les taux de developpement des hybrides sont suffisamment mesap- paries aux conditions prevalentes de l'environnement qu'ils auraient reduit la survie en nature. Ceci donne aentendre que des croisements repetes entre des poissons d'elevage et des poissons sauvages pourraient affecter negativement les popula- tions sauvages. Nos resultats nous amenent donc a reaffirmer les recommandations anterieures basees sur le principe de precaution voulant que des strategies ameliorees soient necessaires pour empecher, ou reduire a un strict minimum, la fuite de poissons d'elevage vers les environnements sauvages.

A incerteza que acompanha o sofrimento ambiental, somada à falta de evidência e às dificuldades de levantar informações científicas sobre a saúde do território costeiro e insular, configura um espaço residual propício para a baixa regulamentação das indústrias e a intensificação de seus impactos sobre os territórios e seus habitantes. Nesse sentido, investigar as experiências de sofrimento ambiental permite aproximar-se das desigualdades socioecológicas da zona marinho-costeira da Patagônia chilena e das estratégias de seus habitantes para propor e mobilizar seus territórios rumo à sustentabilidade.</jats:p>

AB  - Intensive fish farming has an excessive prevalence of infection and is typically controlled by the administration of antibiotics. Although amalgamated antibiotics are a relatively novel therapeutic idea and more effective than traditional antibiotic monotherapy, they can also have a toxic effect on the fish body when it is administered abruptly. This study investigated the cyto-genotoxic effects on erythrocytes and histo-architectural malformations in the liver and kidneys of stinging catfish (Heteropneustes fossilis) in relation to Enrocip plus use as an amalgamated antibiotic agent. The experimental fish with an initial average weight of 17.38 ± 1.94g were divided into four treatment groups with antibiotic doses: according to the recommendation of the manufacturer 0.167 mg/ml Enrocip plus was used as a standard dose (x) and it was treated as T3, while 0% of the standard dose (0x mg/ml), 1/2x (0.083 mg/ml), and 2x (0.333 mg/ml) were treated as T1, T2 and T4, respectively for a period of 30 days. The observed erythrocyte cellular deformities (ECD) were twin, tear-drop, serrated, tail budded and de-membranated cells, whereas the erythrocyte nuclear deformities (END) were a nuclear bridge, bi-nucleus, nuclear termination, karyopyknosis, and micronucleus at different concentrations of Enrocip plus. Both ECD and END percentages experienced the interaction of antibiotic dose and exposure time, and were significantly different (P < 0.01). Significant changes in hepatocytes, mild to severe necrosis, vacuole formation, and hepatopancreas damage were also observed in the liver of the treated fish whereas highly degraded renal tubules and hematopoietic tissue, glomerular occlusion, and vacuolation were evident in the kidneys. The current investigation fully emphasizes the adverse effects of amalgamated antibiotics on the cyto-genotoxicity and the histomorphology of the kidneys and liver of fish. Thus, the use of an amalgamated antibiotic in aquaculture must be carefully evaluated.

AB  - Abstract Two main factors have determined the development for successful aquaculture species—productivity growth and demand growth. However, while we have substantial knowledge of productivity growth, our insights are more limited for demand growth. In this article we investigate the demand growth for salmon in the EU and France using an index approach. Depending on exogeneity assumptions, the measure of demand growth will be either price or quantity oriented. The results indicate that demand growth has been substantial as it is 7.6% per year for the EU and 4.7% for France, on average. The demand growth is anything but smooth over time though, as there are several periods with negative demand growth as well as periods with substantially higher demand growth.

AB  - This study presents two food waste prevention measures focusing on the interface between the food service sector and its food suppliers. Through a case study on procuring salmon by a hotel kitchen, the use of food products with different convenience grades is examined. The convenience grade of the fish bought (whole salmon, fillets or portions) determines where along the food chain filleting and/or portioning takes place and thus where food waste from cut-offs occurs. To reduce food waste, we propose purchasing filleted or portioned salmon rather than whole salmon. For both measures, effectiveness is calculated by looking at food waste reductions along the food chain, achieved by a better use of filleting and portioning cut-offs. Next, sustainability across the environmental, economic and social dimension is evaluated by calculating (a) avoided embodied environmental impacts and economic costs, (b) avoided food waste disposal environmental impacts and economic costs and (c) environmental, economic and social impacts and costs associated with implementing the measures. Purchasing fillets or portions instead of whole salmon leads to food waste reductions of −89% and −94%, respectively. The interventions further lead to net climate change impact savings along the salmon chain of −16% (fillets) and −18% (portions). Whereas the kitchen saves costs when switching to fillets (−13%), a switch to portions generates additional net costs (+5%). On a social level, no effects could be determined based on the information available. However, good filleting skills would no longer be needed in the kitchen and a time consuming preparation can be sourced out.

AB  - Chile has promoted the diversification of aquaculture and red cusk-eel (<i>Genypterus chilensis</i>) is one of the prioritized species. However, many aspects of the biology of the species are unknown or have little information available. These include intestinal microbiota, an element that may play an important role in the nutrition and defense of cultured animals for meat production. This study compares the microbiota composition of the intestinal contents of wild and aquaculture fish to explore the microbial communities present and their potential contribution to the host. DNA was extracted from the intestinal content samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. After the examination of the sequences, strong differences were found in the composition at the level of phylum, being <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Tenericutes</i> the most abundant in aquaculture and wild condition, respectively. At the genus level, the <i>Vagococcus</i> (54%) and <i>Mycoplasma</i> (97%) were the most prevalent in the microbial community of aquaculture and wild condition, respectively. The evaluation of predicted metabolic pathways in these metagenomes showed that in wild condition there is an important presence of lipid metabolism belonging to the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. In the aquaculture condition, the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were relevant. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize and compare the intestinal microbiota of red cusk-eel (<i>Genypterus chilensis</i>) of wild and aquaculture origin using high-throughput sequencing.

AB  - The demand for animal protein especially fish is expanding due to the population growth, increased incomes and changes in eating habits and life styles. The capture fisheries in Malaysia which supply over 70 % of the fish used for food are over-exploited, and the yield has become stagnant over the last decades and in some cases it has even declined. In addition, the balance of trade for the past decade has been negative signaling a threat to the economic growth. However, aquaculture has the potential to meet these challenges if it is well practiced. This can be done through improving productivity of fish farms. The study aims to compute the total factor productivity (TFP) growth and its components. In addition, it aims to identify the sources of TFP growth in aquaculture. Malmquist Productivity Index using data envelopment analysis and regression model has been employed to analyze the data. The TFP growth was estimated to be greater than one, indicating progress in the productivity. According to the results obtained in this study, technological change is the more important contributor to TFP growth. Nevertheless, efficiency changes also play a vital role in improving aquaculture production.

AB  - Species ecology and life history patterns are often reflected in animal morphology. Blue whales are globally distributed, with distinct populations that feed in different productive coastal regions worldwide. Thus, they provide an opportunity to investigate how regional ecosystem characteristics may drive morphological differences within a species. Here, we compare physical and biological oceanography of three different blue whale foraging grounds: (1) Monterey Bay, California, USA; (2) the South Taranaki Bight (STB), Aotearoa New Zealand; and (3) the Corcovado Gulf, Chile. Additionally, we compare the morphology of blue whales from these regions using unoccupied aircraft imagery. Monterey Bay and the Corcovado Gulf are seasonally productive and support the migratory life history strategy of the Eastern North Pacific (ENP) and Chilean blue whale populations, respectively. In contrast, the New Zealand blue whale population remains in the less productive STB year-round. All three populations were indistinguishable in total body length. However, New Zealand blue whales were in significantly higher body condition despite lower regional productivity, potentially attributable to their non-migratory strategy that facilitates lower risk of spatiotemporal misalignment with more consistently available foraging opportunities. Alternatively, the migratory strategy of the ENP and Chilean populations may be successful when their presence on the foraging grounds temporally aligns with abundant prey availability. We document differences in skull and fluke morphology between populations, which may relate to different feeding behaviors adapted to region-specific prey and habitat characteristics. These morphological features may represent a trade-off between maneuverability for prey capture and efficient long-distance migration. As oceanographic patterns shift relative to long-term means under climate change, these blue whale populations may show different vulnerabilities due to differences in migratory phenology and feeding behavior between regions. <b>Spanish abstract</b> La ecología y patrones de historia de vida de las especies a menudo se reflejan en la morfología animal. Las ballenas azules están distribuidas globalmente, con poblaciones separadas que se alimentan en diferentes regiones costeras productivas de todo el mundo. Por lo tanto, brindan la oportunidad de investigar cómo las características regionales de los ecosistemas pueden impulsar diferencias morfológicas dentro de una especie. Aquí, comparamos la oceanografía física y biológica de tres zonas de alimentación diferentes de la ballena azul: (1) Bahía de Monterey, California, EE. UU., (2) Bahía del sur de Taranaki (BST), Nueva Zelanda, y (3) Golfo de Corcovado, Chile. Adicionalmente, comparamos la morfología de las ballenas azules de estas regiones utilizando imágenes de aeronaves no tripuladas. La Bahía de Monterey y el Golfo de Corcovado son estacionalmente productivos y apoyan la estrategia migratoria de la historia de vida de las poblaciones de ballena azul chilena y del Pacífico Norte Oriental (PNO), respectivamente. Por el contrario, la población de ballena azul de Nueva Zelanda permanece en la menos productiva BST durante todo el año. Las tres poblaciones eran indistinguibles en cuanto a la longitud corporal total. Sin embargo, las ballenas azules de Nueva Zelanda tenían una condición corporal significativamente mayor a pesar de una menor productividad regional, potencialmente atribuible a su estrategia no migratoria que facilita un menor riesgo de desalineación espaciotemporal con oportunidades de alimentación disponibles de manera más consistente. Alternativamente, la estrategia migratoria de las poblaciones de ballenas PNO y chilena puede tener éxito cuando su presencia en las zonas de alimentación se alinea temporalmente con la abundante disponibilidad de presas. Documentamos diferencias en la morfología del cráneo y la aleta caudal entre poblaciones, que pueden estar relacionadas con diferentes comportamientos de alimentación adaptados a las características de hábitat y presas específicas para cada región. Estas características morfológicas pueden representar una compensación entre la maniobrabilidad para la captura de presas y una migración eficiente a larga distancia. A medida que los patrones oceanográficos cambian en términos de mediano a largo plazo debido al cambio climático, estas poblaciones de ballenas azules pueden mostrar diferentes vulnerabilidades debido a diferencias en la fenología migratoria y el comportamiento de alimentación entre regiones.

AB  - In this paper, the different possibilities and innovations related to sustainable aquaculture in the Mediterranean area are discussed, while different maricultural methods, and the role of Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) in supporting the exploitation of the ocean’s resources, are also reviewed. IMTA, and mariculture in general, when carefully planned, can be suitable for environmental restoration and conservation purposes. Aquaculture, especially mariculture, is a sector that is progressively increasing in parallel with the increase in human needs; however, several problems still affect its development, mainly in relation to the choice of suitable sites, fodder production, and the impact on the surrounding environment. A current challenge that requires suitable solutions is the implementation of IMTA. Unfortunately, some criticisms still affect this approach, mostly concerning the commercialization of new products such as invertebrates and seaweeds, notwithstanding their environmentally friendly character. Regarding the location of a suitable site, mariculture plans are currently displaced from inshore to offshore, with the aim of reducing the competition for space with other human activities carried out within coastal waters. Moreover, in open water, waste loading does not appear to be a problem, but high-energy waters increase maintenance costs. Some suggestions are given for developing sustainable mariculture in the Mediterranean area, where IMTA is in its infancy and where the scarce nutrients that characterize offshore waters are not suitable for the farming of both filter feeder invertebrates and macroalgae. From the perspective of coupling mariculture activity with restoration ecology, the practices suggested in this review concern the implementation of inshore IMTA, creating artificially controlled gardens, as well as offshore mussel farming coupled with artificial reefs, while also hypothesizing the possibility of the use of artificially eutrophized areas.

AB  - The study of environmental impacts of seafood production as a result of ecolabelling and certification is a young yet rapidly growing discipline that lacks theoretical models. Pieces of the model have been suggested in the literature, and these pieces are formalized here realizing the current operating parameters of the global seafood industry. The derived pull-threshold model assumes that if producers exceed the threshold, there is no incentive to improve while if too far below, improvement is most likely beyond technical or financial means. Thus, a single certification is only a marginal solution to the larger picture. Those producers immediately below the certification threshold are within range or ‘pull’ of the threshold to improve as a result of certification. Results from a single threshold model applied to compliance data indicated that a maximum improvement of 12.5%, achieved when the pull was the greatest and the threshold was at the lower end of the impact distribution. When impacts were continuous (e.g. escapes in aquaculture), greater improvement was observed with thresholds targeting the producers at the higher end of the impact distribution. In all cases, improvement was maximized with a triple threshold model, indicating that single threshold scenario will not drive the greatest movement towards environmental improvement throughout the industry. Innovation is potentially more important in reducing environmental impacts of seafood production and needs to be accounted for as the seafood certification or ecolabelling continues to mature.

AB  - The intensive use of antibiotics in modern aquaculture has been linked to the emergence of multidrug resistance in human health. Despite continuous caution against such use by farmers, antibiotics serve as the primary means of disease control in aquaculture. In this study, we explore the potential of medicinal plant extracts as immunomodulant in enhancing the innate immune defense of a fish host, Heterotilapia buttikoferi, infected with the prevalent fish pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Our previous research reveals the bactericidal activity of the medicinal plant, Mallotus japonicus, against the pathogen, but its effectiveness as a prophylactic in enhancing host immune defense has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the objective of this study is to address this knowledge gap. By our findings, it was uncovered that the supplementation of the diethyl ether extract of the plant's bark as an additive in the fish diet significantly improved the innate immune defense by upregulating the total levels of lysozyme, serum bactericidal activity, globulin and albumin levels, total protein, phagocytosis, respiratory burst activity and overall survival. A dose-dependent increase in immunological parameters was recorded, and this was in sharp contrast to the control group. These findings suggest that M. japonicus has the potential of use to enhance the innate immune defense of H. buttikoferi against the pervasive fish pathogenic bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila. The improvements in immune parameters indicate the ability of M. japonicus extract to strengthen the hosts to combat bacterial infections.

AB  - The northern Chilean Patagonia region is a key feeding ground and a nursing habitat in the southern hemisphere for blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus). From 2014 to 2019, during 6 separate research cruises, the dive behavior of 28 individual blue whales was investigated using bio-logging tags (DTAGs), generating ≈190 h of data. Whales dove to significantly greater depths during the day compared to nighttime (day: 32.6 ± 18.7 m; night: 6.2 ± 2.7 m; P < 0.01). During the night, most time was spent close to the surface (86% ± 9.4%; P < 0.01) and at depths of less than 12 m. From 2016 to 2019, active acoustics (scientific echosounders) were used to record prey (euphausiids) density and distribution simultaneously with whale diving data. Tagged whales appeared to perform dives relative to the vertical migration of prey during the day. The association between diurnal prey migration and shallow nighttime dive behavior suggests that blue whales are at increased risk of ship collisions during periods of darkness since the estimated maximum ship draft of vessels operating in the region is also ≈12 m. In recent decades, northern Chilean Patagonia has seen a large increase in marine traffic due to a boom in salmon aquaculture and the passenger ship industry. Vessel strike risks for large whales are likely underestimated in this region. Results reported in this study may be valuable for policy and mitigation decisions regarding conservation of the endangered blue whale.

AB  - Carp aquaculture in South Asia suffers severely from a lack of genetic management, which has eroded the genetic quality of both captive and wild populations. Use of molecular markers, especially microsatellites, has revolutionized genetic management of hatchery stocks through its ability to detect kinship between individuals and hence in controlling level of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. In the present PhD work, microsatellite markers were applied to breeding programmes for silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to study different genetic management aspects and new markers were generated from rohu (Labeo rohita).
A set of newly isolated microsatellite markers from silver carp were characterized and two pentaplex PCR reactions were optimized to enable rapid genotyping of large number of individuals at 10 microsatellite loci. The utility of these markers in parentage, sibship and relatedness analysis were assessed by applying them to groups of fish with known relationship. These markers were used for parentage analysis in a breeding programme designed to estimate heritability of harvest weight and length in silver carp. Full- and half-sib families were created in three sets of partly factorial mating and all the families from each set were reared in communal ponds from very early life stages. With ten microsatellites 96.3% of the offspring could be assigned to a single family. Heritability estimates were found to be 0.65 ± 0.13 for weight and 0.50 ± 0.13 for length. High estimates of h2 suggested that this population should respond rapidly to selection for increased harvest size.
Microsatellite markers were also applied to monitor the early stages of a mass selection programme in common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The selection was initiated from a base population synthesized from six different stocks. The selected individuals were divided to create two separate lines. The aims of this study were to monitor whether the stocks were represented in the intended proportions in the F1 selected populations, to investigate the relative contribution of families and its impact on effective population size and to identify any loss of molecular genetic variation. Five highly polymorphic microsatellites were used for parentage analysis of the selected fish to track stock and family contribution. Overall, large perturbations were observed in the relative contributions of two major stocks. Family contribution was also highly variable, causing the Ne to drop to below half the census size. A loss of 6.9%-12.2% of microsatellite alleles was observed but loss of heterozygosity was not very prominent. The replicate lines showed significant differences in allelic distribution after the first generation of selection, but not in genotypic distribution.
Finally, 52 microsatellite markers were isolated from a partial genomic library of rohu using a selective hybridization protocol. Characterization of these markers resulted in 36 polymorphic loci, which will be useful in future work on…

AB  - The growth of the salmon aquaculture industry has attracted an increasing number of investors. Investors are conscious of economic consequences of climate change for the salmon farming companies, hence their demand for climate-related financial disclosure has increased. This study discusses potential climate-related financial impacts imposed on the salmon aquaculture production as identified by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). We use data from 2016 to 2021 available on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) platform, and we show to what extent salmon aquaculture companies disclose their climate-related risks. We find that when the demand of investors for climate-related financial disclosure increases, more firms tend to comply with their requests, while based on the CDP's evaluation system, the firms perform better in minimizing their carbon impact. We argue that when salmon aquaculture companies publish their climate-related financial disclosure, they ensure transparency for their investors and secure a smooth transition into a low carbon economy.

AB  - Sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi) are external parasites that affect farmed salmonids in Chile, and the scale of their sanitary and economic impact cannot be overstated. Even though space-time patterns suppose parasite aggregation, specific locations related to different infestation levels, as well as their associated factors across the geographic range involved, had not been investigated as of the writing of the present article. The understanding of the effects and factors entailed by the presence of C. rogercresseyi may be deemed a key element of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). In the present study, the multivariate spatial scan statistic was used to identify geographic areas and times of C. rogercresseyi infestation and to estimate the factors associated with such patterns. We used official C. rogercresseyi monitoring data at the farm level, with a set of 13 covariates, to provide adjustment within the analyses. The analyses were carried out for a period of 5 years (2012-2016), and they included three fish species (Salmo salar, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and Oncorhynchus kisutch) in order to assess the consistency of the identified clusters. A retrospective multinomial, spatial, and temporal scan test was implemented to identify farm clusters of either of the different categories of C. rogercresseyi infested farms: baseline, medium, and high, based on the control chemical threshold established by the health authority. The baseline represents adequate farm performance against C. rogercresseyi infestation. Then, production and environmental factors of the medium and high infestation farms were compared with the baseline using regression techniques. The results revealed a total of 26 clusters (p < 0.001), of which 12 correspond to baseline, 1 to medium, and the remaining 13 to high infestation clusters. In general, baseline clusters are detected in a latitudinal gradient on estuarine areas, with increasing relative risks to complex island water systems. There is a spatial structure in specific sites, north of Los Lagos Region and central Aysen Region, with high infestation clusters and epidemic peaks during 2013. In addition, average weight, salmon species, chemotherapeutants, latitude, temperature, salinity, and year category are factors associated with these C. rogercresseyi patterns. Recommendations for an IPM plan are provided, along with a discussion that considers the involvement of stock density thresholds by salmon species and the spatial structure of the efficacy of chemical control, both intended to avoid the advance of resistance and to minimize environmental residues.

AB  - A rapidly growing literature investigates how the recent Covid-19 pandemic has affected international seafood trade along multiple dimensions, creating opportunities as well as challenges. This suggests that many of the impacts of the Covid measures are subtle and require disaggregated data to allow the impacts in different supply chains to be teased out. In aggregate, Norwegian salmon exports have not been significantly impacted by Covid-related measures. Using firm-level data to all export destinations to examine the effects of lockdowns in different destination countries in 2020, we show that the Covid-related lockdown measures significantly impacted trade patterns for four product forms of salmon. The results also illustrate how the Covid measures create opportunities, as increased stringency of the measures increased trade for two of the product forms. We also find significant differences among firms' responses, with large firms with larger trade networks reacting more strongly to the Covid measures. The limited overall impacts and the significant dynamics at the firm level clearly show the resiliency of the salmon supply chains.

AB  - <jats:p>Fish microbiota studies have mostly addressed intestinal bacterial communities because of their role in fish physiology; however, the skin microbiota has been studied less despite its role as the first pathogen barrier in the host. DNA-based molecular techniques have contributed to improving our understanding of the skin microbiota, but this approach faces challenges, such as the low count of bacteria in healthy fish skin. To overcome this limitation, an RNA-based approach was developed to study the skin microbiota in salmonids, including tissue sampling, RNA extraction, and downstream procedures to obtain PCR amplicons for next-generation sequencing. The protocol originated in this work overcomes the limitations of low bacterial counts and is useful for describing active microbiota in fish skin. The application of the protocol to salmonids reared in both an experimental setting and on a farm revealed that the trout skin microbiota was dominated by bacteria from the phylum Proteobacteria (&gt;65%). At the genus level, Piscirickettsia (46%) was highlighted as the most abundant in the experimental unit samples; in contrast, Pseudoalteromonas (26%), followed by Escherichia_Shigella (~25%), was the most abundant in farmed trout.</jats:p>

AB  - This study examines the financial performance of six Norwegian salmon farming companies to investigate the benefits of differentiation through organic salmon production. Utilizing panel data from 2009 to 2020, the study analyses return on sales, prices, and production costs. The results show that the company that has differentiated parts of its production into organic salmon consistently achieves higher returns on sales. Notably, this company also maintains the lowest production costs despite organic farming's typically higher expenses. This efficiency is seemingly attributed to the firm's emphasis on "biological risk management," leading to reduced salmon mortality rates. Contrary to Michael Porter's differentiation versus low-cost strategy debate, this study indicates that a combined approach may be possible. The findings underscore the potential competitive edge of organic production in salmon farming and prompt questions about why it is not more common in the industry.

AB  - Abstract Aquaculture now produces nearly half of the seafood consumed globally. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is one of the top aquaculture products and the most valuable farmed marine finfish species in the United States (U.S.). The aim of this study is to better understand veterinary drug use in U.S. net pen Atlantic salmon aquaculture and compare these findings to other salmon producing countries and U.S. livestock. We collected and analyzed records on Atlantic salmon production and veterinary drug use in Maine (2003 to 2017) and Washington (2012 to 2017). Antimicrobial medicated feeds were used in 8% and 93% of production cycles in Maine and Washington, respectively. Oxytetratcycline was the primary drug used in both states. Maine used no antimicrobials in eight of the past 15 yrs., including none in 2017. Emamectin benzoate, an antiparasitic medicated feed, was used in 28% production cycles in Maine (2014 to 2017; avg. 1.1 kg/yr) and no emamectin benzoate was administered in Washington over the time period studied. From 2014 to 2016, the U.S. farmed salmon industry contributed 0.8% ± 0.1% to annual global farmed salmon production and administered 1.2% ± 0.6% of antimicrobials used in global salmon farming. Over the same time period, Norway and Chile accounted for 53% ± 3% and 35% ± 3% of annual global production, and administered 0.06% ± 0.02% and 96% ± 0.09% of antimicrobials used in global salmon farming. Compared to U.S. terrestrial agriculture in 2016, the U.S. Atlantic salmon industry contributed 0.031% to U.S. food animal production and administered 0.057% of antimicrobials available to U.S. food animals. Based on the data we collected, the U.S. Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry is a relatively small user of antimicrobials compared to U.S. beef, pigs, poultry, and Chilean salmon industries. There are relatively few approved drugs in the U.S. to treat aquaculture diseases and more options are needed as well as continued work on vaccines. Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide public health concern; the overuse or misuse of antimicrobials in any setting can compromise the treatment of bacterial infections. The U.S. net pen Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry appears to be the first U.S. food animal industry to report monthly antimicrobial use at the farm-level to the government. These data are critical to assess public health risks associated with antimicrobial use and resistance, and therefore, are needed from all U.S. food animal industries.

AB  - An Indo-Pacific scleractinian coral has invaded the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM): Tubastraea micranthus. It was initially observed on one oil platform (GI-93C) near the Mississippi River. Here, we determined whether its populations were spreading and whether there was evi- dence of rapid expansion. We compared population density data of T. micranthus with those from T. coccinea, a congener which invaded the western Atlantic earlier. Fourteen oil/gas platforms were assessed down to 138 m depth using remotely operated vehicle digital video. Colony den - sities in numbers m �2 were determined for both species, and colony size was measured for T. micranthus. Data were analyzed by platform and for geographic distribution. T. micranthus densities were highest on GI-93C and on GI-116A, SW of the Mississippi River, being significantly higher than on other platforms. Densities declined radially from there. Mean colony size was high- est on MC-311A, with colonies generally being >100 cm 2 . This platform is situated at the head of the Mississippi Canyon and may have been the original site of colonization. It also receives blue water instead of turbid, lower salinity water, and this species may grow better under those condi- tions. T. micranthus size frequency distributions were generally skewed towards 1-200 cm 2 (5 cm diameter) (sometimes >90% of the population), suggesting that most populations are potentially in an expanding growth phase. T. coccinea densities were high (range: ~50 to 300 colonies m �2 ). Its populations were also centered SW of the Mississippi River. T. micranthus is spreading through this region, and the window for its potential eradication may be closing.

AB  - Climate-driven changes in freshwater inputs have been shown to affect the structure and function of coastal ecosystems. We evaluated changes in the influence of river runoff on coastal systems of Northwestern Patagonia (NWP) over recent decades (1993-2021) by combined analysis of long-term streamflow time series, hydrological simulation, satellite-derived and reanalysis data on sea surface conditions (temperature, turbidity, and salinity). Significant decreases in minimum streamflow across a zone spanning six major river basins were evident at weekly, monthly, and seasonal scales. These changes have been most pronounced in mixed-regime northern basins (e.g., Puelo River) but appear to be progressing southward to rivers characterised by a nival regime. In the adjacent two-layer inner sea, reduced freshwater input corresponds with a shallower halocline and increased surface temperatures across northern Patagonia. Our results underscore the rapidly evolving influence of rivers on adjacent estuarine and coastal waters in NWP. We highlight the need for cross-ecosystem observation, forecasting, mitigation and adaptation strategies in a changing climate, together with corresponding adaptive basin management of systems that supply runoff to the coastal marine waters.

AB  - A novel antibacterial immunostimulant using Platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and lectin from Metapenaeus dobsoni (Md-Lec) was developed. The Md-Lec and PtNPs (Pt-lec) hybrid formed through non-covalent interaction exhibits antimicrobial activity against fish specific pathogens by affecting membrane integrity and producing excess reactive oxygen species. The therapeutic efficacy of Pt-lec was demonstrated through rescuing Aeromonas hydrophila infected Nile Tilapia. Pt-lec prevents the infection spreading and reduces the bacterial bioburden in less than 12 h, and as a result of this the fish were restored to normalcy. To assess immunostimulation, we studied the expression of three different immune related genes, namely LEC, Myd88 and COX-2 in the gills, liver, spleen and kidney of fish under various experimental conditions. Our results showed that Pt-lec treatment appeared to be better when compared to lectin alone in enhancing the expression of Myd88 and COX-2, but LEC was not as expected. These results suggest that Pt-lec has the ability to protect Nile Tilapia against bacterial infection by restricting bacterial bioburden through their direct effects on the bacterial membrane and indirectly through their effects on host immune-related gene expression. This hybrid could have potential "green" application in fish farming in rescuing infected animals when compared to widely and unregulated antibiotics.

AB  - The growth of aquaculture has been accompanied by controversy over the sustainability of many of the practices used in fish farming. Public attitudes towards aquaculture are unlikely to have been untouched by this, and there seems little doubt that the social acceptability of the industry is shaped by people's perception of its environmental record. What is less clear, however, is how far such perceptions influence consumer behaviour. This paper reports on a survey of public attitudes towards salmon farming in Scotland, which inter alia collected data on the frequency of salmon purchases. The results show that purchasing is influenced by both context and attribute variables, including environmental preferences. Specifically, it was found that increased concern over the environmental performance of the salmon farming industry is associated with a lower propensity to purchase salmon. The findings pose a number of challenges for the aquaculture industry, not least in the area of marketing.

AB  - The objective of this chapter is to give an overview and analysis of the current trends and developments in biotechnology in aquaculture research and management. The technological developments along with structural changes in the aquaculture sector may affect access and intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes. These issues will be discussed in a wide perspective involving both short and long-term biological effects, ethical and other social aspects (economic, legal and political issues), including their partly inherent contradictions needing compromising for sustainable development. The chapter will focus on current biological challenges within aquaculture as a growing food production sector, with less emphasis on external effects such as environmental effects. Cases from farmed salmon and cod in Norway in addition to shrimp and tilapia in Asia will be highlighted.

AB  - <jats:p>The primary barrier to research into feed efficiency of Atlantic salmon (<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>) is the lack of a reliable method to assess individual feed intake in large cohorts of fish over a growth period. A method with potential is the X-ray method, which images radio-opaque markers (beads) in feed consumed by fish. However, the time taken to count the markers in the digestive tract of fish is extremely onerous and the method has previously been shown to have low repeatability. Furthermore, the method has not been assessed and optimized for Atlantic salmon. Firstly, we made use of image analysis to count beads within the digital radiographs, which was highly correlated to manual counting by human observers (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.99). Remarkably, image counting was up to 6 times faster than human counting when the number of beads per fish was high (&amp;gt; 300 per fish). We investigated the potential effect of different sources of error on the feed mass to bead count calibration equation and found the effects of X-ray exposure setting and the position of pellets on the X-ray plate to be negligible on the bead counts of both human and image analysis. We tested different feeding periods with the time of the X-ray images to minimize the loss of beads through defecation. We found that fish should be X-rayed within 6.5–11 hours of first being offered feed for a 6-hour feeding period which fed the entire daily ration. Lastly, we assessed the repeatability of feed intake over a 70-day growth period from 80–300 grams and found feed intake to be significantly and moderately repeatable (r = 0.45 ± 0.11), indicating developments in the method result in a consistent ranking of individual fish based on feed intake from three repeated measurements. The X-ray method combined with image analysis greatly reduces counting time without compromising accuracy, achieves promising repeatability, and is feasible in Atlantic salmon parr.</jats:p>

AB  - Global aquaculture production continues to increase across a variety of sectors, including Atlantic salmon production in Scotland. One limitation to the expansion of open-cage aquaculture is disease-induced stock losses as well as the potential for disease agents from farms interacting with other farms and possibly with wild salmonids. Epidemiological studies of disease- agent transmission often omit environmental transmission of organisms, although this process is an integral part of parasite spread and incidence. Within the aquatic environment, water move- ments enable pathogens and parasites to potentially be transmitted over long distances. As patho- gens and parasites are transported, their status can change; they can degrade or, in the case of sea lice, develop into an infectious stage. A combination of biological and physical models is required to understand the transmission of disease-causing organisms. Here we propose a set of compo- nents that have been implemented in a range of modelling studies of sea lice dispersal, and describe how such attributes have been used in developing a study in one of Scotland's largest fjordic systems. By developing descriptive simulation model frameworks, which are validated using physical and biological observations, alternative methods of integrated pest management can be investigated and developed. The identification of dispersal routes of sea lice and establish- ment of potential farmfarm connections can inform sea lice management.

AB  - The assessment report of the 4th International Panel on Climate Change confirms that global warming is strongly affecting biological systems and that 20-30% of species risk extinction from projected future increases in temperature. It is essential that any measures taken to conserve individual species and their constituent populations against climate-mediated declines are appropriate. The release of captive bred animals to augment wild populations is a widespread management strategy for many species but has proven controversial. Using a regression model based on a 37-year study of wild and sea ranched Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) spawning together in the wild, we show that the escape of captive bred animals into the wild can substantially depress recruitment and more specifically disrupt the capacity of natural populations to adapt to higher winter water temperatures associated with climate variability. We speculate the mechanisms underlying this seasonal response and suggest that an explanation based on bio-energetic processes with physiological responses synchronized by photoperiod is plausible. Furthermore, we predict, by running the model forward using projected future climate scenarios, that these cultured fish substantially increase the risk of extinction for the studied population within 20 generations. In contrast, we show that positive outcomes to climate change are possible if captive bred animals are prevented from breeding in the wild. Rather than imposing an additional genetic load on wild populations by releasing maladapted captive bred animals, we propose that conservation efforts should focus on optimizing conditions for adaptation to occur by reducing exploitation and protecting critical habitats. Our findings are likely to hold true for most poikilothermic species where captive breeding programmes are used in population management.

AB  - Filifolinone is an aromatic geranyl derivative, a natural compound isolated from Heliotropum sclerocarpum, which has immunomodulatory effects on Atlantic salmon, upregulating cytokines involved in Th1-type responses through a mechanism that remains unknown. In this work, we determined whether the immunomodulatory effects of filifolinone depend on the host microbiotic composition. We evaluated the effect of filifolinone on immune genes and intestinal microbiotic composition of normal fish and fish previously treated with bacitracin/neomycin. Filifolinone induced the early expression of IFN-α1 and TGF-β, followed by the induction of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ. A pre-treatment with antibiotics modified this effect, mainly changing the expression of IL-1β and IFN-γ. The evaluation of microbial diversity shows that filifolinone modifies the composition of intestinal microbiota, increasing the abundance of immunostimulating organisms like yeast and firmicutes. We identified 69 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with filifolinone-induced IFN-γ. Our results indicate that filifolinone stimulates the immune system in two ways, one dependent on fish microbiota and the other not. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microbiota-dependent immunostimulation in Salmonids.

AB  - In the face of declining oceanic fisheries throughout the world, industrial aquaculture and corporate fish farming have become the fastest growing sector of the global food industry, accounting for nearly half of all the fish and shellfish consumed by humans today. Despite its contribution to food production, however, the rapid growth of aquaculture has launched an anti-fish farming movement composed of scientists, environmental NGOs, fishers, native peoples, and coastal residents who oppose the industry's negative socio-environmental effects on marine habitats, indigenous fish stocks and cultures, as well as commercial and recreational fisheries. This article examines the growing environmental controversy over the collapse of wild salmon populations and the rise of salmon farming production in the Pacific Northwest, as well as the negative impacts of the aquaculture industry on the region. Drawing on movement literature and documents, as well as interviews with local stakeholder activists in Washington S...

AB  - Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine in early 2022 has brought geopolitics, particularly classical geopolitics, back into the political and economic discussions and decision-making. Discursive, as well as real-world change, has been rapid, as the turn of the 21st century was the time of globalisation and neoliberal ideology – the free movement of people, products, and services. However, in this paper, we argue that classical geopolitics has defined the development of Northern industries even before the war began in 2022. Our interview data (n = 60) collected in the advent of the Russian invasion of Ukraine reveal that the themes of state power; 'hard' security meaning military armament; the economy as a field of national interests; and spill-over effects of geopolitical tensions between superpowers have framed economic fortunes in the European Arctic. It is concluded that the state actors' interests in the European Arctic's physical space and natural assets will be increasingly expanding.

AB  - Escape of migratory finfish species from fish farms, such as Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., offer a challenge when considering the environmental risks of cage culture. The migratory behav- iour of groups of cultured salmon smolts and postsmolts after a simulated escape was studied in a small fjord from May to October using telemetry. Five groups of fish were released approximately every 6 wk from mid-May to late October, each of them composed of 15 to 20 fish equipped with acoustic transmitters and 1780 to 3700 individuals tagged with T-bar anchor tags. The migratory behaviour of the smolts was well developed in postsmolts for at least 6 wk after transfer to sea cages in May, but was less evident in August and was almost absent 2 mo later, when residency was promi- nent. In contrast to the first 2 groups that moved out of the 21 km-long fjord within a few days, fish released from August to October were being recaptured in the fjord several months after release. The actions required to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of cage-rearing therefore appear to depend on the developmental stage the fish has reached when it escapes. During the first summer months in the sea, efforts to prevent rapidly migrating smolts and postsmolts from escaping should be given priority. The chance of recapture in the small fjord used in this study increased as fish grew and dispersal rate decreased in autumn.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, usually cationic, and amphiphilic molecules that play a crucial role in molecular and cellular host defense against pathogens, tissue damage, and infection. AMPs are present in all metazoans and several have been discovered in teleosts. Some teleosts, such as salmonids, have undergone whole genome duplication events and retained a diverse AMP repertoire. Salmonid AMPs have also been shown to possess diverse and potent antibacterial, antiviral, and antiparasitic activity and are induced by a variety of factors, including dietary components and specific molecules also known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which may activate downstream signals to initiate transcription of AMP genes. Moreover, a multitude of cell lines have been established from various salmonid species, making it possible to study host-pathogen interactions in vitro, and several of these cell lines have been shown to express various AMPs. In this review, the structure, function, transcriptional regulation, and immunomodulatory role of salmonid AMPs are highlighted in health and disease. It is important to characterize and understand how salmonid AMPs function as this may lead to a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions with implications for aquaculture and medicine.

AB  - This paper investigates production license management when regulation constrains the number of production licenses to address production externalities. This is increasingly relevant for aquaculture production where disease issues threaten future seafood supply. The regulatory problem is analyzed in the context of Norwegian salmon aquaculture where a stop in issuance of new production licenses has been implemented to address social costs of parasitic sea lice. Our theoretical model shows that restricting number of licenses raises prices and shifts production efforts excessively towards greater stocking of fish per license. Hence, the policy cannot achieve a first-best welfare-maximizing allocation. Furthermore, restricting entry by limiting number of licenses can create regulatory rents, which effectively subsides rather than tax the source of the externality.

AB  - A large and growing body of scientific research has documented the benefits of seafood in the human diet (nesheim and yaktine 2007; FAo/WHo 2011). A rising global awareness of the benefits of seafood, together with population growth, should lead to increased seafood demand in the future. Consumers will not only demand more seafood but also increased product quality and diversity as they become wealthier (Jensen 2006). to satisfy the world’s growing seafood demand, the seafood sector must innovate in many areas. Finite global resources in terms of wild fish stocks and available areas for aquaculture, together with substantial external environmental effects, provide significant innovation pressure on the sector. despite local and global constraints due to environmental challenges and competing user interests, aquaculture has to provide most of the future growth in seafood production, since most of the world’s fish stocks are fully exploited or over-exploited (Smith et al. 2010b). during the last few decades aquaculture has been the world’s fastest growing food production technology, creating a blue revolution (Asche 2008). Furthermore, aquaculture is better positioned than fisheries to provide the product quality and diversity that future consumers will demand, as a higher degree of control with the production process facilitates innovation in both production processes and products (Anderson 2002; Asche 2008; Asche, Roll, and tveteras 2009). However, the fisheries sector must not be ignored as a future supplier of healthy, nutritious food and food diversity. Through innovation there is much scope in fisheriesbased value chains to reduce supply cost and improve product quality and safety. An important source of innovation is the government regulations that provide constraints and

AB  - Estimation of the opportunity cost is necessary for the economic assessment of environmental conservation policies. This paper considers the case where an environmental good is negatively affected in the process of the production of marketable goods. In the presence of externalities, conservation implies the undertaking of abatement measures by polluters. A relevant measure of opportunity cost in these settings is the abatement cost required to preserve or restore a unit of the environmental good in question. Current economic literature lacks an established methodology for deriving such measures, as it commonly focuses on pricing pollutants rather than the natural stocks affected by them. This paper uses a non-optimal valuation approach suggested by Fenichel and Abbott (JAERE 1(1/2):1–27, 2014) as a point of departure and develops a framework for deriving the opportunity cost of conservation as the cost of externality abatement per unit of environmental good. An empirical illustration is provided for the case of the farmed and wild salmon trade-off in Norway in light of the current pollution control regulations.

AB  - Abstract The Norwegian salmon farming industry is currently facing significant obstacles to future growth. The major challenge is posed by the high level of sea lice in the sea nets at the salmon farms. At the moment both salmon farmers and the supplying industries are working on developing ways to deal with the sea lice problem so that the industry can continue the growth observed during the last decade. This work attempts to fill the lack of investment studies dealing with risk management related to the lice challenge, as well as analysis of investments in new technologies used to abate this problem. Specifically, we address a two-fold investment problem of an aquaculture firm. First, we find the optimal adoption timing of disruptive innovation that has the potential to offer a long-term solution to the lice problem and is subject to uncertain technology development. Second, we find the optimal investment amount in temporary lice-fighting measures. Our results indicate that the high investment cost causes the firm to wait relatively long before adopting the disruptive technology. Consequently, it invests a relatively large amount in short-term methods.

AB  - Chile is the second-largest producer of Atlantic salmon in the world, and the Chilean salmon production accounts for 27% of the world’s production. One important step of the productive cycle in freshwater is the smoltification process that prepares the fish for the marine life stage. This review describes the biological basis of smoltification in Atlantic salmon, with particular attention on branchial osmoregulatory adaptations. We also discuss some of the infectious diseases and problems in smoltification (two of the main causes of losses in Chilean aquaculture) that could be related from a physiological point of view.

               <jats:p>One week of study was conducted to observe the potential of ginger crude extract in the treatment of tiger grouper (<jats:italic>Epinephelus foscoguttatus</jats:italic>) infected by a pathogenic bacterium in aquaculture, <jats:italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</jats:italic>. A total of 135 fish were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1ml of <jats:italic>A. hydrophila</jats:italic> (10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> CFU ml<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and stock in 15 aquaria (13L). Four concentrations of ginger extract (0.4g/L, 0.8g/L, 1.2g/L and 2.0g/L) were used as the treatment and the control is 0g/L. Water parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and salinity of the treatment tank were in the range of (4.05 – 4.20 ppm), (7.2 – 8.2), (25.6 – 28.8°C) and (22-25ppt) respectively. The extract’s potential as a treatment agent in the infected fish was recorded in terms of fish survival and physical condition such as the sign of bacterial infection and swimming behaviour. The results show infected tiger grouper treated with a concentration of ginger extract of 0.8g/L can improve the survival rate of fish by 89%. It can be concluded that crude ginger extract can enhance the survival rate and has the potential to be used as a chemotherapeutic agent in bacterial infection of tiger grouper fish.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Alternative food production technologies are being developed to meet the global increase in population and demand for a more sustainable food supply. Aquaponics, a combined method of vegetable and fish production, is an emerging technology that is widely regarded as sustainable. Yet, there has been limited research on its environmental performance, especially at a commercial scale. In this study, life cycle analysis (LCA) was used to assess the environmental impacts of food produced by an urban commercial aquaponic system located next to a retail store in a cold-weather region (Östersund, Sweden). The functional unit (FU) used is 1 kg of fresh produce, which includes cucumber (<jats:italic>Cucumis sativus</jats:italic>), tomatoes (<jats:italic>Solanum Lycopersicum</jats:italic>), and Atlantic salmon (<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>). The system boundary is set from cradle to farm or retailer's gate due to the proximity of the aquaponic system to the retail store. Results were reported employing eight environmental impact categories, including global warming potential (GWP), marine eutrophication (MEU), and cumulative energy demand (CED). According to contribution analysis, the main hotspots of the system are electricity, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment, and heating. Potential areas to mitigate the impact of these parameters were highlighted in this study, including the establishment of symbiotic links to utilize urban waste and by-products. The impact per vegetable or fish produced was partitioned using energy and economic allocation and compared to other common cultivation methods. The yearly harvest from the aquaponic system was also compared to importing these food items from other European countries which showed lower annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the aquaponic system.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effects of sea lice on the marine survival of wild salmonids are widely debated. In Norway this debate has reached a crescendo as the Norwegian government has recently ratified a management system where the growth in the salmonid aquaculture industry will be conditional on regional estimated impact of salmon lice on wild fish. Sea lice have thus become the most prominent obstacle to the stated political aim of quintupling aquaculture production in Norway by 2050. Scientific documentation that salmon lice impact the marine survival of salmon is robust. However, it is also evident that marine survival of salmon is strongly impacted by other factors, and that the effect of salmon lice is most likely an integral part of these other mortality factors. In this paper, our goal is to discuss and give advice on how managers and policy makers should handle this complexity, and to identify the greatest challenges in using scientific results to construct robust management rules. Inadequate extrapolation from the scale of known effects to the scale of management implementation may initially give a false impression of scientific certainty, but will eventually fuel upsetting disagreements among stakeholders as they gradually uncover the shaky foundation of the implemented policy. Thus, using a single model and parameter to determine management advice is not warranted, as no single data point reflects the natural complexity of nature. Furthermore, robust management rules should be based on unambiguous definitions of key concepts. Finally, despite the scientific consensus that salmon lice are a risk to salmon, studies on wild populations in situ that accurately quantify the impact of salmon lice are still urgently needed. We give advice on how this can be accomplished.</jats:p>

AB  - It is widely accepted that disease interactions between cultured and wild fish occur repeatedly, although reported cases have mainly relied just on the observation of similar symptoms in affected populations. Whether there is an explicit pathogen transfer between fish stocks, or each develops its own pathogen population, has been insufficiently studied and rarely supported by molecular tools. In this study, we used population dynamics and genetic structure of the monogenean Furnestinia echeneis in reared and neighbouring wild sea bream to indicate pathogen transfer, characterized by the phenotypic plasticity of the parasite attachment apparatus and the lack of phylogenetic differentiation. The observed pattern of genetic variation inferred by nuclear DNA Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) and mtDNA cytochrome C oxidase 1 (COI), between parasite populations is most likely caused by a recent shared demographic history like a reduced species area in the last glacial period. In spite of such recent expansion that populations underwent, F. echeneis shows differentiation in haptor morphometry as an adaptive trait in closely related populations at the aquaculture site. This suggests that differentiation in morphology may occur relatively rapidly in this species and that adaptive forces, not the speciation process, drives this monogenean parasitation. On the other hand, the observed phylogenetic inertia suggests a low to moderate gene flow (based on FST) between parasites in cultured and wild fish, evidencing for the first time the transfer of pathogens at the aquaculture site inferred by a molecular tool.

AB  - Abstract Chilean aquaculture mainly produces salmonids and molluscs. Salmonid production has been questioned by its excessive use of antimicrobials. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial microbiota composition of Mytilus spp. cultivated near salmonid farms and to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to florfenicol and oxytetracycline of its culturable bacteria. Seven Mytilus farming sites classified according to their proximity to salmon farms as close (CSF) or distant (DSF) were sampled in two years. We analyzed Mytilus microbiota composition through culture-independent methods, and isolated culturable bacteria, and identified those isolates with MIC values ≥ 64 μg mL−1 to florfenicol or oxytetracycline. Results revealed that the alpha diversity was affected by sampling year but not by Mytilus farming site location or its interaction. Nevertheless, in 2018, we observed a significant negative correlation between the alpha diversity of Mytilus microbiota in each farm sites and the tonnes of florfenicol reported for each phytosanitary management area. We detected significant differences in beta diversity and relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa in Mytilus microbiota depending on the proximity to salmon farms and years. A higher proportion of isolates with MIC values ≥ 64 μg mL−1 to both antibiotics was detected in 2019 compared to 2018, but not significant differences were detected according to Mytilus farming site location. However, in 2019, isolates from CSF sites showed higher MIC values for both antibiotics than those from DSF. Bacterial genera corresponding to isolates with MIC values ≥ 64 μg mL−1 represented a low proportion of Mytilus microbiota identified with the culture-independent approach, reflecting the need to implement new methodologies in the study of antimicrobial resistance. These results suggest that the proximity to salmonid farms and sampling year influence the Mytilus microbiota and MIC values of their bacterial isolates; however, other environmental variables should be considered in further studies.

AB  - This review describes the global use and exchange of salmonid genetic resources for human food from fisheries and aquaculture. Trends in population abundance, variations in the harvest of wild stocks, historic transfers and worldwide translocations of stocks for fisheries and aquaculture are briefly described for seven species of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus), for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and for Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Also considered are the tools currently used to assist in the conservation of endangered wild populations (e.g. captive breeding programmes and gene banks) and the major techniques developed to enhance the production of cultured stocks (selective breeding, hybridization, sex control, chromosome set manipulation and gene transfer). The review briefly discusses the significance of salmon production to the economy of selected countries and the complexity of allocating economic value to long-range migratory fisheries resources that also hold direct and indirect value for aboriginal/native communities and recreational users.

AB  - Globally aquaculture contributes 8% of animal protein intake to the human diet, and per capita consumption is increasing faster than meat and dairy consumption. Reports have documented antimicrobial use in the rapidly expanding aquaculture industry, which may contribute to the rise of antimicrobial resistance, carrying potential consequences for animal-, human-, and ecosystem-health. However, quantitative antimicrobial use across a highly diversified aquaculture industry is not well characterized. Here, we estimate global trends in antimicrobial use in aquaculture in 2017 and 2030 to help target future surveillance efforts and antimicrobial stewardship policies. We estimate antimicrobial use intensity (mg kg-1) for six species groups though a systematic review of point prevalence surveys, which identified 146 species-specific antimicrobial use rates. We project antimicrobial use in each country by combining mean antimicrobial use coefficients per species group with OECD/FAO Agricultural Outlook and FAO FishStat production volumes. We estimate global antimicrobial consumption in 2017 at 10,259 tons (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3163-44,727 tons), increasing 33% to 13,600 tons in 2030 (UI 4193-59,295). The Asia-Pacific region represents the largest share (93.8%) of global consumption, with China alone contributing 57.9% of global consumption in 2017. Antimicrobial consumption intensity per species group was: catfish, 157 mg kg-1 (UI 9-2751); trout, 103 mg kg-1 (UI 5-1951); tilapia, 59 mg kg-1 (UI 21-169); shrimp, 46 mg kg-1 (UI 10-224); salmon, 27 mg kg-1 (UI 17-41) and a pooled species group, 208 mg kg-1, (UI 70-622). All antimicrobial classes identified in the review are classified as medically important. We estimate aggregate global human, terrestrial and aquatic food animal antimicrobial use in 2030 at 236,757 tons (95% UI 145,525-421,426), of which aquaculture constitutes 5.7% but carries the highest use intensity per kilogram of biomass (164.8 mg kg-1). This analysis calls for a substantial scale-up of surveillance capacities to monitor global trends in antimicrobial use. Current evidence, while subject to considerable uncertainties, suggests that for some species groups antimicrobial use intensity surpasses consumption levels in terrestrial animals and humans. Acknowledging the fast-growing nature of aquaculture as an important source of animal nutrition globally, our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship in a high-growth industry with broad links to water and ecosystem health.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture production has grown considerably in recent years, and parallel to this growth public interest in production and product has also increased. In most salmon producing countries there have been reports of both public dismay and support for the industry. In this paper we investigate and compare public perceptions, understood as to what degree the industry has a social license to operate, across three countries. In Tasmania (AU), Iceland and Norway, the salmon aquaculture industry has a varying foothold, something which is also reflected in public perceptions. An outline of the three contextual settings is therefore provided. We undertook surveys using a standardized questionnaire which was distributed to respondent panels in the three countries. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. The findings show some similarities and notably mostly differences between the respondent groups. A comparative approach as reported here requires understanding of contextual factors to offer explanatory power to the analysis. The results from the comparative survey is therefore discussed in light of the various contextual settings. We found that many respondents are supportive of the aquaculture industry in their respective countries (Iceland less so), but that there is something amiss, which the respondents feel is not achieved. While support is related to industry contributions of food production, employment, and business activity, the respondents also report acceptance of the industry and view the industry to be important. However, the respondents are less supportive of the industry with regards to sustainability, industry regulation, and distribution of economic benefits. We suggest that efforts to increase societal support for aquaculture must be adapted and related to the contextual environment the industry operates in, both locally and nationally. A pivotal element in this context is the public's knowledge of the industry, which is deemed important for their assessment of perceived advantages and challenges posed by the industry on both local and national level, and the necessary trade-offs between them in forming a supportive or critical opinion.

AB  - As an alternative food source to wild fisheries, aquaculture shows a great potential to help meet the growing demand for seafood and animal protein. The expansion of aquaculture has been achieved partly by system intensifica- tion, which has drawn vast criticisms of aquaculture for its environmental, social and economic sustainability issues. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become the leading tool for identifying key environmental impacts of seafood production systems. A LCA evaluates the sustainability of diverse aquaculture systems quantitatively from a cradle-to-grave perspective. It provides a scien- tific basis for analysing system improvement and the development of certifica- tion and eco-labelling criteria. Current efforts focus on integrating local ecological and socio-economic impacts into the LCA framework. A LCA can play an important role in informing decision makers in order to achieve more sustainable seafood production and consumption. This article reviews recent applications of LCA in aquaculture, compares the environmental performance of different aquaculture production systems, explores the potential of including biodiversity issues into LCA analysis and examines the potential of LCA in set- ting criteria for certification and eco-labelling.

AB  - This article builds on the literature investigating productivity and efficiency in the Norwegian salmon farming industry. The objective of this article is to investigate the determinants of inefficiency. We use a stochastic frontier approach that allows the estimation of a production function and an inefficiency function. The sources of inefficiency can be separated into temporary shocks and factors that lead to permanent efficiency differences. The results indicate an improvement in technical efficiency over time. This improvement can partly be explained by a restructuring of the industry, with firms becoming bigger and more specialized, as well as by improvements in government regulations. The inefficiency that is still present is mainly the result of temporary shocks. Disease outbreaks seem to be the most important of these temporary shocks, as disease problems lead to early harvesting or destruction of the fish and thereby, obviously, increase inefficiency.

AB  - In this Letter, we report the outcomes of the first edition of the ‘Marine Biotechnology and Aquaculture for Sustainable Development’ training that took place in August 2022 in Mar del Plata, Argentina. We learned about the current fishery and aquaculture production in South America, with emphasis to the recent program ‘Pampa Azul’ released by the Argentinean authorities. Lectures of recent studies that contributed to the Argentine marine biotechnology and the prospects of fishery and aquaculture technology in the Amazon region were given to the participants. The importance of circular bioeconomy within the context of fishery and aquaculture was highlighted in detail via seminary discussions. At the end of the Letter, participants gave a glimpse into the lessons learned from the training, illustrating that interdisciplinary communication and face-to-face networking are essential attributes to expand collaborative research in the South American countries.

AB  - The properties of intestinal bacteria/probiotics, such as cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), auto-aggregation, and biofilm formation ability, play an important role in shaping the relationship between the bacteria and the host. The current study aimed to investigate the cell surface properties of fish intestinal bacteria and probiotics. Microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons was tested according to Kos and coauthors. The aggregation abilities of the investigated strains were studied as described by Collado and coauthors. The ability of bacterial isolates to form a biofilm was determined by performing a qualitative analysis using crystal violet staining based on the attachment of bacteria to polystyrene. These studies prove that bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is associated with the growth medium, and the effect of the growth medium on CSH is species-specific and likely also strain-specific. Isolates of intestinal lactobacilli from fish (<i>Salmo ischchan</i>) differed from isolates of non-fish/shrimp origin in the relationship between auto-aggregation and biofilm formation. Average CSH levels for fish lactobacilli and <i>E. coli</i> might were lower compared to those of non-fish origin, which may affect the efficiency of non-fish probiotics use in fisheries due to the peculiarities of the hosts' aquatic lifestyles.

AB  - The evolution of pathogenic microorganisms that can resist a wide range of antimicrobial treatments leading to treatment failure and loss of human and animal life represents one of the most thoughtful public health concerns in the world. The marine ecosystem is now increasingly recognized as a potentially significant "hotspot" for the emergence, maintenance, and dispersal of many clinically relevant and potentially novel AMR genes and microbes. The trends on AMR surges in marine life are the reflections of the conditions in humans. AMR in the marine ecosystem is a natural and ancient phenomenon, albeit higher levels are always related to increased human activities. Various marine pollutants and indiscriminate use of chemicals, including antimicrobials, in aquaculture practices contribute to AMR in the marine ecosystem. Antimicrobials used to treat infections in coastal aquaculture practices can get into the marine environment, which could adversely impact the marine biodiversity and terrestrial animal and human health consequent to the selection of AMR bacteria and AMR genes. Persistent pollutants like plastics function as important vectors for the dissemination of AMR bacteria into the marine ecosystem. As there are several ways these AMR bacteria and genes can be conveyed back to terrestrial animals and humans, AMR surges in the marine ecosystem represent a significant zoonotic health risk. The present chapter summarizes the current knowledge on AMR in the marine ecosystem and the major future research perspectives in the area.

AB  - Climate change and increased global population give rise to a special emphasis on how agriculture can expand production under changing conditions. Agriculture has also seen radical changes the last century with a turn towards research-based, industrialized agriculture with large-scale monocultures, mechanization, increased irrigation, use of artificial fertilizers, and pest control systems, combined with a change from local towards export-orientedmaking of products to be used for food, feed, fuel, and fiber. Biotechnology-based interventions such as systematic breeding, as witnessed in the Green Revolution, and genetic modification have led to commercially successful but politically controversial herbicide-tolerant and pest-resilient varieties of major crops, with promises of a wide range of new varieties in the years to come. In recent years nanotechnology methods and products have been added to the techno-scientific possibilities of improvements to agricultural production. As yet, there are few if any commercially available products, but nanotechnology holds promises for increasing efficiency within animal and plant breeding; for increased nutritional value, and production inputs as feed additives, chemicals, and pesticides; for new efficient means for diagnosis and surveillance of diseases; as well as possibilities for precision farming techniques. Moreover, also with importance for agriculture is the possibility for using nanosensors for detecting and removing salt and pollutants from water and soil. Here some of these new developments will be briefly presented, with focus mainly on the agriculture production system and not on food products as such (packaging, detection of contaminants and pathogens, nano barcodes, etc.). New emerging technologies as nanotechnology can be used for solving problems as well as enhancing production and efficiency but do also raise questions with regard to food and environmental safety and socio-economic, ethical, and regulatory issues that will be highlighted.

AB  - The search for effective strategies to prevent and mitigate accidental releases of aqua- culture fishes is on-going. To test a new recapture strategy and evaluate the individual dispersal behaviour of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. at the northern limit of its range, 39 adult salmon (mean ± SD fork length and weight: 85.5 ± 5.0 cm and 7.4 ± 1.4 kg, respectively) were implanted with depth-sensing acoustic tags and released in a north Norwegian fjord during the spring of 2007. The fish were released from 2 aquaculture sites in the Altafjord system and tracked using both mobile and fixed receivers. The coastal marine bag-net fishery, in combination with in- river angling, was tested as a potential recapture strategy. Immediately following the simulated escape event, the fish dove to near-bottom depths, subsequently returning to surface levels within the following days. The fish dispersed rapidly (9.5 ± 19.2 km d -1 ), traveling outward to coastal waters along the edges of the fjord. The bag-net fishers and anglers recaptured 79% of the escaped fish within 1 mo post-release, 90% of which were from bag nets. While most of the fish left the fjord, 7 tagged fish (18%) entered the Alta River estuary (3 of which later migrated up the Alta River), and 1 returned to the Altafjord the following year, presumably to spawn. The results showed that recapture efforts need to be immediate and widespread to mitigate farm-escape events. Coastal bag nets were effective at recapturing escaped farmed salmon, compared to previously tested methods, and would be especially useful in areas where gill-netting is not permitted.

AB  - SummaryWild yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi Valenciennes, 1833) and Samson fish (S. hippos Gunther, 1876) were tagged with nylon-headed, single-barbed dart tags between December 1, 2004 and December 31, 2006 in Spencer Gulf and offshore from the west coast of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. Two-hundred and forty-one S. lalandi and 73 S. hippos were tagged. Twenty-four S. lalandi were recaptured and the maximum distance between capture points was 130 km and the maximum time at liberty was 442 days. Two S. hippos were recaptured, of which one was at liberty for a maximum of 378 days. Both S. hippos were recaptured at the original capture site. Recapture results indicate that large S. lalandi remain in, or return to, northern Spencer Gulf. This region may be important for aggregations of large, reproductively mature S. lalandi. One large S. lalandi tagged at Port Augusta was recaptured near Fitzgerald Bay, indicating that wild fish may move past S. lalandi sea-cage farms in this region. This course of ...

AB  - Abstract The rapid growth of aquaculture and concerns about economic and ecological ‘sustainability’ have focused attention on industry externalities. Developing institutions which ‘sustain’ aquaculture will require skills in the ‘art and science’ of public policy modelling. Analysis of existing approaches demonstrates that no single modelling paradigm is ‘best’ for all aquaculture policy situations. Modelling approaches other than cost‐benefit including multiobjective analysis may be more appropriate if the objective of the modeller is to improve the effectiveness of the policy process itself. A review of the relatively small but growing literature on aquaculture policy models reveals a wide range of issues and approaches. In general, economic models have focused on the single objective of maximizing efficiency; in contrast, models used in actual aquacultural policy and planning focus on controlling environmental pollution. The findings suggest that economic models have not yet played a significant role ...

AB  - Abstract Since the beginnings of the aquaculture industry in Norway, the salmon farming industry has grown from a pioneering niche to a massive industrial adventure. Since 1992, Norwegian salmon production has increased to ten times its 1992 level. By 2015, the Norwegian production constituted 53% of the world's production of Atlantic salmon. Therefore, it could be said that salmon farming is the most important industry in rural Norway today, with a yearly landing value of about 6.1 billion EUR. As the production has grown, along with the income, numerous environmental issues have arisen. The present paper gives an overview of these environmental problems and discusses potential solutions, as well as the need for a better and more holistic regulation of the industry. The experience from Norwegian salmon farming with respect to environmental issues and regulation may give important insights to both other salmon producing countries as well as producers of other fish species.

AB  - Governance and management strategies for aquaculture development were examined for a select number of jurisdictions covering a range of marine aquaculture production to better understand the degree to which concepts of "Ecological Carrying Capacity" (ECC) are incorporated into management tools or permitting requirements for aquaculture development. Policies, regulations, and strategic plans were sought through professional knowledge and, at times, using web-based searches. Aquaculture ECC, defined here as, "the magnitude of aquaculture production that can be supported without leading to unacceptable changes in ecological process, species, populations, or communities in the environment," was not strictly applied in any jurisdiction's aquaculture policy documentation. A broadened search to consider the concept of aquaculture carrying capacity (CC) more generally was conducted. Of the ten nations examined, CC concepts could be found in policy documentation of several nations. The inclusion of CC concepts in policy and strategic planning can be used as part of a suite of management tools to promote sustainable aquaculture within FAO's Ecological Approach to Aquaculture.

AB  - This research estimates the effects of COVID-19 on the U.S. supply and demand for salmon over two distinct periods. The first period reflects the first year (2020) since the COVID-19 outbreak, and the second period covers the outbreak’s second year (2021). The effects of COVID-19 on salmon prices, domestic production, and imports are analysed through graphics, elasticities, and spatial welfare economics derived from the equilibrium displacement model of the U.S. salmon market. In the first year, COVID-19 caused a reduction in domestic demand. As a result, U.S. salmon producers and consumers lost $302 million. Consumer loss accounts for 87% of this value. In 2021, however, domestic consumption recovered, with a positive effect of $447 million on consumers, outweighing the negative impact from 2020. Together, the domestic producers and consumers gained approximately $512 million. The net market gain (a combination of the first- and second-year effects) was $210 million. These results are subject to the magnitudes of change in demand and supply due to COVID-19 and transportation costs.

AB  - World-wide, tetracycline is among the most commonly used and produced antibiotics. The entry of these chemicals into domestic sewage can result in water pollution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new nano-adsorbent for separating tetracycline from aquatic environments. Lab-scale and batch experiments were conducted. Tetracycline removal parameters, such as temperature, adsorbent amount, and initial concentration of antibiotic, as well as contact time, were investigated. Using Response Surface Methodology (Central Composite Design), effective parameters were optimized and the appropriate model was developed for predicting tetracycline removal. We determined the structure and morphological properties of nano absorbents by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Data obtained from practical tests were compared with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Furthermore, the adsorption kinetics of this new adsorbent were studied. Results showed that the best absorption, which was equal to 99.96 %, occurred at 30 °C, with 1000 mg of nano-adsorbent per liter, 20 mg of tetracycline per liter, and 90 min of incubation. According to RSM, the quadratic model is the most appropriate equation to calculate tetracycline separation by this new nano adsorbent with R2 = 0.9931. Furthermore, the results of the studies related to adsorption kinetics and isotherms demonstrate that this process follows pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherms. The high ability of this nanocomposite to absorb tetracycline as well as its ease of separation due to its magnetic properties make this nano adsorbent an ideal choice for removing tetracycline from water.

AB  - The present analytical study, based on regular time series data (for 30 years period from 1980/81 to 2009/10), aims at analyzing sources of o utput growth in the states of Punjab and Haryana vis-a-vis the overall Indian economy. Speci fically, objective of the paper was to examine whether output growth in these economies ha s been driven primarily by inspiration or perspiration or by both. For this purpose, output-o riented DEA-based Malmquist Productivity Index approach was adopted with Net Domestic Produc t as output, and Labour, Capital and Electricity Consumption as three inputs. It was observed that in each of the periods (viz., prereforms, post reforms and the overall span), both o utput growth and TFP growth were the fastest in case of Haryana, followed next by the overall In dian economy. The TFP growth in Punjab continued to remain negative during all the three t ime spans. In a majority sectors of each of the two states’ economies, TFP growth has failed to pic k up its pace during post-reforms vis-a-vis pre-reforms period. Nevertheless, tertiary sector ( as also its sub-sectors) of the aggregated Indian economy registered a significant improvement in TFP growth during the reforms period. Further, as per decomposition analysis of the sourc es of growth, inspiration component has contributed negatively whereas perspiration compone nt has contributed positively to output growth in all the sectors of Punjab. On the other h and, both inspiration and perspiration components have contributed, in general, positively in the Haryana state and the aggregated Indian economy. Nevertheless, growth in factor accu mulation has surpassed that in TFP in all the sectors of these economies. Thus, as per the fi ndings, the three economies, in general, and Punjab economy, in particular, need to strive for a productivity-driven economic growth, so as to achieve sustainability in the growth process. As primary sector has fared quite poorly in all the three economies and during all the periods/ sub -periods; therefore, stringent measures (such as consolidation of rural infrastructure, and promo tion of agro-based rural industrialization) need be adopted for providing resilience to this se ctor of crucial importance (providing employment to a large chunk of the population), so as to achieve inclusiveness in the growth process.

AB  - Growth hormone (GH) transgenic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is one of the first transgenic animals being considered for commercial farming, yet ecological and genetic concerns remain should they enter the wild and interact reproductively with wild fish. Here, we provide the first empirical data reporting on the breeding performance of GH transgenic Atlantic salmon males, including that of an alternative male reproductive phenotype (i.e. small, precocially mature parr), in pair-wise competitive trials within a naturalised stream mesocosm. Wild anadromous (i.e. large, migratory) males outperformed captively reared transgenic counterparts in terms of nest fidelity, quivering frequency and spawn participation. Similarly, despite displaying less aggression, captively reared nontransgenic mature parr were superior competitors to their transgenic counterparts in terms of nest fidelity and spawn participation. Moreover, nontransgenic parr had higher overall fertilisation success than transgenic parr, and their offspring were represented in more spawning trials. Although transgenic males displayed reduced breeding performance relative to nontransgenics, both male reproductive phenotypes demonstrated the ability to participate in natural spawning events and thus have the potential to contribute genes to subsequent generations.

AB  - Marine ingredients are still regarded as a vital constituent of aquaculture and other livestock feeds. Despite numerous publications that have discussed the sustainability issues, there are few sources that provide detailed information that allow for quantification of marine ingredient environmental impact. A Life Cycle Inventory was compiled from many available literature sources that will allow for Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of marine ingredients using standard methodologies. While this inventory is the most complete to date, there are still important data gaps that the industry should endeavour to fill. Demonstration of the inventory using an economically allocated LCA showed that marine ingredients are very variable in their impact between and even within species, mostly depending on the fuel intensity of the fishery from which they are sourced. Marine ingredients were typically lower in environmental footprint compared to terrestrial ingredients, although LCAs do not take into account the stock status of fisheries, which must be considered separately.

AB  - This paper investigates the degree of market integration between several product forms of US wild salmon and Norwegian farmed salmon. While several studies have investigated the link between farmed salmon and fresh and/or frozen wild salmon markets, we expand the literature with the inclusion of the products canned salmon and salmon roe. Understanding how canned salmon and salmon roe are related to the broader salmon market is of importance to US fisheries, as these products are high-price exports for the United States. Our results find evidence of cointegration between the Norwegian farmed salmon market and all US salmon products. Domestic and international economic conditions, such as production technological advances within farmed salmon production, environmental challenges, and changes in trade regulations, which affect the market for farmed salmon, will hence also influence US prices of frozen and canned salmon, as well as salmon roe.

               <jats:p>Mariculture has a profound potential to sustainably meet the escalating demands for food and livelihoods. However, the socioeconomic impacts of small-scale aquaculture (SSA) are poorly understood, particularly for marine SSA in China, a leading global producer of aquaculture products. Using detailed household surveys, we comprehensively evaluated profitability, income inequality, and subjective well-being of marine SSA households in a representative coastal city in Southeastern China. Our results show that mariculture practices increased income but exacerbated income inequality in animal mariculture households (AMHs) and seaweed mariculture households (SMHs). Earnings from AMHs (544 549 yuan) were four times higher than those of SMHs (141 172 yuan) although AMHs were twice as likely to make a loss (27.4% versus 12.5%). Natural capital (11.37%) and the cultured variety (12.40%) were the main contributors to mariculture income inequality for AMHs, while manufactured capital (27.59%) and previous mariculture experience (8.59%) were significant for SMHs. The well-being of AMHs was better than that of SMHs. Our results suggest that secure access to sea areas, provision of financial options to mariculture smallholders, as well as diversification in mariculture type and variety could promote the socioeconomic sustainability of mariculture development.</jats:p>

AB  - Rapid evolution can increase or maintain the provision of ecosystem services, motivating the conservation of wild species and communities. We detail one such contemporary evosystem service by synthesizing theoretical evidence that rapid evolution can sustain parasiticide efficacy in salmon aquaculture, thus creating an added incentive for salmon conservation. Globally, wild and farmed salmon share native parasites: sea lice. In most major salmon farming areas sea lice have evolved resistance to parasiticides, but in the North Pacific, where farmed salmon coexist with large wild salmon populations, resistance has not emerged. We present a model to show that flow of susceptible genes from lice hosted on wild salmon to those hosted on farmed salmon can delay or preclude resistance. This theoretical and observational data suggests that wild salmon (both oceanic populations that function as a refuge and local migratory populations that connect this refuge to domesticated environments) provide an evosystem service by prolonging parasiticide efficacy. To preserve this service, aquaculture managers could avoid production quantities that exceed wild salmon abundances, and sustain wild salmon populations through regional and oceanic scale conservation. The evosystem service of resistance mitigation is one example of how a contemporary evolutionary process that benefits people can strengthen the case for conservation of intrinsically important wild species.

AB  - <jats:p>The mortality of Atlantic salmon is one of the main challenges to achieving its sustainable production. This sector benefits from generating many data, some of which are collated in a standardized way, on a monthly basis at site level, and are accessible to the public. This continuously updated resource might provide opportunities to monitor mortality and prompt producers and inspectors to further investigate when mortality is higher than expected. This study aimed to use the available open-source data to develop production cycle level dynamic linear models (DLMs) for monitoring monthly mortality of maricultured Atlantic salmon in Scotland. To achieve this, several production cycle level DLMs were created: one univariate DLM that includes just mortality; and various multivariate DLMs that include mortality and different combinations of environmental variables. While environmental information is not collated in a standardized way across all sites, open-source remote-sensed satellite resources provide continuous, standardized estimates. By combining environmental and mortality data, we seek to investigate whether adding environmental variables enhanced the estimates of mortality, and if so, which variables were most informative in this respect. The multivariate model performed better than the univariate DLM (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .004), with salinity as the only significant contributor out of 12 environmental variables. Both models exhibited uncertainty related to the mortality estimates. Warnings were generated when any observation fell above the 95% credible interval. Approximately 30% of production cycles and more than 50% of sites experienced at least one warning between 2015 and 2020. Occurrences of these warnings were non-uniformly distributed across space and time, with the majority happening in the summer and autumn months. Recommendations for model improvement include employing shorter time periods for data aggregation, such as weekly instead of on a monthly basis. Furthermore, developing a model that takes hierarchical relationships into account could offer a promising approach.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The deliberate release of captive-bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridisation, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco-genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence soft selection has on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing intrusion from foreign/domesticated individuals. While based on a generalised salmonine lifecycle, the model is applicable to any taxon that experiences incursion from locally maladapted genotypes, in addition to phenotype-dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g., breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, soft selection limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability, and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under- appreciated interactions between soft selection and maladaptive hybridisation, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self-sustaining wild populations.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Here, we review extensive information to estimate environmental risks from escaped non‐native salmonids based on the assessments of <jats:italic>hazard</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>sensitivity</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>exposure</jats:italic> of discrete water bodies in Chile. In 2020, the country harvested about 1 million tons salmonids from net pens located along 1500 km of highly biodiverse coastline. We base our analysis on existing scientific information and authors' expert opinions including an assessment of knowledge gaps and uncertainties. Risks of environmental impacts differed by salmon species, being lowest for Atlantic salmon due to its estimated lower survival, lower ability to feed after escaping and lower reproductive capacity in the wild compared to coho salmon and rainbow trout. Overall risks due to escapes of any of the species were highest in areas of both high farming intensity and low capacity of mitigating escapes (by wild predators and fishers) such as Aysén District. At same time, risk was higher in the most farmed areas that also presented suitable habitats to support reproduction and juvenile salmonid rearing. However, the risk estimation certainty differed among species being lowest for Atlantic salmon due to insufficient monitoring of their fate in the wild. Monitoring the fate and impacts of escaped salmonids, specially in higher risk areas is recommended to improve risk projections and to prevent and mitigate further impacts. Since Atlantic and coho salmon are not yet successful invaders in Chile, research attention is urgently needed to assess the environmental consequences of escapes of these species. The present approach can be applied to any aquaculture system given the availability of information on farmed species and receiving ecosystems.</jats:p>

AB  - The impact of parasites on hosts is invariably negative when considered in isolation, but may be complex and unexpected in nature. For example, if parasites make hosts less desirable to predators then gains from reduced predation may offset direct costs of being parasitized. We explore these ideas in the context of sea louse infestations on salmon. In Pacific Canada, sea lice can spread from farmed salmon to migrating juvenile wild salmon. Low numbers of sea lice can cause mortality of juvenile pink and chum salmon. For pink salmon, this has resulted in reduced productivity of river populations exposed to salmon farming. However, for chum salmon, we did not find an effect of sea louse infestations on productivity, despite high statistical power. Motivated by this unexpected result, we used a mathematical model to show how a parasite-induced shift in predation pressure from chum salmon to pink salmon could offset negative direct impacts of sea lice on chum salmon. This shift in predation is proposed to occur because predators show an innate preference for pink salmon prey. This preference may be more easily expressed when sea lice compromise juvenile salmon hosts, making them easier to catch. Our results indicate how the ecological context of host–parasite interactions may dampen, or even reverse, the expected impact of parasites on host populations.

AB  - <jats:p>The potential of polychaetes for the bioremediation of aquaculture sludge gained more attention in recent years. These organisms can reduce organic matter and nutrients contained in the sludge of several aquaculture species, improving the sustainability of these activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the removal performance of Perinereis gualpensis (Jeldes, 1963) being fed with aquaculture sludge produced by a recirculating system cultivating Atlantic salmon. The experiment involved adding different amounts of sludge (10% and 20% with respect to total substrate) at a density of 300 organisms m−2 during 30 days. A treatment without sludge served as a control, using natural substrate. The highest removal rate of total organic matter (TOM) (23.95 ± 13.19 g m−2 day−1) was achieved by P. gualpensis with 20% sludge addition, a reduction of about 36% compared to the total amount added at the beginning of the trials. The organisms fed with aquaculture sludge presented higher nitrogen (8–9%) and carbon (40–43%) contents, with a maximum organic carbon assimilation of 32% in relation to the total content in the sludge. The high survival (88–95%) and positive growth rates (0.28% day−1) achieved by P. gualpensis indicated that this species can be sustained with salmon sludge as the only source of food. These results indicate that P. gualpensis is a promising candidate for removing nutrients from salmon effluents. Moreover, the protein contents achieved by the organisms (52–58%) meet the dietary protein requirements of several aquaculture species. Further research is needed to determine the maximum bioremediation capacity of this species and to evaluate the lipid content and fatty acid profiles of P. gualpensis to determine its potential application in aquaculture feed.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The growth of the net pen salmon farming industry and the concurrent decline of many wild salmon populations have generated an ongoing call for research into the potential role of infectious agents associated with salmon farming. Here, we describe a method to screen for the presence of viral nucleic acids by sampling biological waste in the vicinity of farms. We collected biological samples adjacent to 56 marine net pens from five different companies, and two farm salmon processing plants ( n = 230), 70% of samples were positive for Piscine orthoreovirus-1 (PRV-1). Viral genome segments S1 ( n = 68) and M2 ( n = 39) were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Sequences were all monophyletic to the clade of PRV-1 routinely found in the region. Consistent with previous studies, samples collected near Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar) farms were related to a lineage of PRV-1a commonly detected in both farmed and wild salmon in British Columbia, while a related lineage of PRV-1a was detected near Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) farms. Similarity in sequence within companies suggests that Atlantic salmon freshwater hatcheries are a probable source of this virus to the marine environment, concordant with recent detections of PRV-1 within those hatcheries.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>We analyzed growth performance and waste emissions of cage aquaculture responding to biophysical conditions that vary along the coastline of Norway. The analysis is based on a published mass balance model predicting waste emissions and open quality-assured data from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries between 2016 and 2020. Results showed significant regional variation in feed conversion rate, with a steady increase from the Northern to Southern region (p &lt; 0.001) and a co-occurring reduction in waste emission. The retention rate of feed carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in tissues of farmed Atlantic salmon <jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic> Linnaeus, 1758 varied from 39 to 43% of consumed nutrients across regions. The estimated defecation rate of C, N and P was 18% of consumption, whereas excretion or respiration varied from 39 to 43% across regions. This variability, along with farming methods and location characteristics, could potentially impact regional differences in benthic ecosystems. The regional differences in feed and environmental cost could potentially attract salmon farming to shift towards the Northern region, and this trend might become strengthened as water temperatures rise due to climate change. Additionally, salmon growth and feed intake rate interacted significantly with temperature (p &lt; 0.001) and showed regular seasonal variation. The regulation of maximum allowed biomass restricts salmon farmers from increasing biomass beyond their maximum allowed level at any time. Nevertheless, the same biomass may cause higher waste in the summer. Therefore, we suggest an awareness of the seasonal increase in waste emissions and consideration of implementing environmental assessment for surface waters, which might be beneficial for decreasing the risk of reduced water quality.</jats:p>

AB  - In 2016, a massive harmful algal bloom (HAB) of Alexandrium catenella around Chiloe island caused one of the major socio-ecological crisis in Chilean history. This red tide occurred in two distinct pulses, the second, most anomalous, bursting with extreme toxicity on the Pacific coast, weeks after the highly controversial dumping off Chiloe of 4,700 t of rotting salmons, killed by a previous HAB of Pseudochattonella verruculosa. We study the transport of this pollution, analyzing the physical oceanographic conditions during and after the dumping. We find that a cyclonic gyre was present between the dumping site and the coast, visible in satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature data. Using Lagrangian simulations, we confirm that near-surface currents could have brought part of the pollution to the coast, and fueled the bloom. This scenario explains also the anomalous later finding of ammonium near Chiloe. Finally we discuss the mismanagement of risk throughout the events.

AB  - Salmon farming industry in Chile currently uses a significant quantity of antimicrobialsto control bacterial pathologies. The main aims of this study were to investigate the presence of transferable sulfonamide- and trimethoprim-resistance genes, sul and dfr, and their association with integrons among resistant Gram-negative strains recovered from Chilean salmon farming. For this purpose, 91 strains recovered from various sources of 7 Chilean salmonid farms were studied for thepresence of these genesusing PCR, with specific primers. 28 strains (30.8%) were found to carry at least one type of sul gene, mainly associated with a class 1 integron (17 strains), and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as mainly belonging to the Pseudomonas genus (21 strains). Of these, 22 strains carried the sul1 gene, 3 strains carried the sul2 gene and 3 strains carried both the sul1 and sul2 genes. Among these, 19 strains also carried the class 1 integron-integrase gene intI1, 1 strain also carried the dfrA1 gene, 6 strains carried the dfrA12 gene, 2 strains carried the dfrA14 gene and 2 strains simultaneously carried the dfrA1 and dfrA12 genes or the dfrA12 and dfrA14 genes. Otherwise, the sul3 and intI2 genes were not found, whereas the intI1 gene was also detected in 2 strains not carrying any sul or dfr genes. In addition, the capacity to transfer these resistance determinants by conjugation was evaluated in 6 selected strains.Sulfonamide resistance was successfully transferred by all assayed strains, mainly mediated by a 10 kb plasmid, with a frequency of transfer of 5.0×10-4 to 8.4×10-3 transconjugant per recipient cell, and exhibiting a co-transference of resistance to florfenicol and oxytetracycline, currently the most used antibiotic in the Chilean salmon industry, suggestingan antibacterial co-selection phenomenon.Donor strains identified as Citrobacter gillenii and Kluyvera intermedia transferred simultaneously sul1 and sul2 genes suggesting that they are located on the same plasmid. This is the first report of the characterization and transferability of integrons as well as sul and dfr genes among bacteria associated with Chilean salmon farms, indicating a relevant role of this environment as a reservoir of these genes.

AB  - Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon is a nutritious type of food in increasing demand and although production has stagnated and is faced by various challenges, it is likely to continue to expand in the future. We present results from a detailed greenhouse gas emission assessment of the most important Norwegian farmed salmon export products along with improvement measures. By scaling up both baseline results and reduction opportunities, based on growth projections, we estimate current and future emissions of the sector as a whole. We show that export of gutted salmon to Europe by truck dominates Norwegian salmon exports, not only in volume and value, but also in emissions, followed by export of fresh gutted salmon and fillets to Asia and fillets to the US by air. The cumulative greenhouse gas emissions are dominated by feed production followed by emissions from the overseas airfreighting of fresh products. The five most important emission reduction measures, based only on existing technology and without particular order were 1) slightly increased feed efficiency, 2) increased utilization of side streams occurring in secondary processing after export, 3) seafreight to market instead of road and air, 4) higher energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, and 5) changed feed composition. Collectively, they have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of current production by 60%, from 5.2 to 2.1 million tonnes of CO2e, assuming the same relative importance of each supply chain. This implies that a medium growth-scenario, representing more than a doubling of the volume of salmon farmed to 3.3 million tonnes, would be possible while reducing total sector emissions by 16% if the improvement measures were fully implemented. For larger reductions, either lower growth or a more ambitious implementation of improvement measures is needed. Although greenhouse gas emissions are often linked to resource efficiency and wider sustainability, this is not always the case, and it is important to avoid shifting burdens from climate to e.g. eutrophication or biodiversity impacts. However, many environmental impacts of salmon farming are centered around feed efficiency, and even problems with welfare, escapees, and in part eutrophication are reflected in lower feed efficiency resulting in higher greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the systematic collection of robust data for more continuous monitoring of greenhouse gas emission performance over time, we therefore recommend identifying additional indicators to monitor to ensure the sector develops not only towards climate neutrality but also towards broader sustainability.

AB  - As a catadromous fish, Asian sea bass (<i>Lates calcarifer</i>) juveniles migrate from seawater (SW) to freshwater (FW) for growth and development. During migration, they undergo physiological changes to acclimate to environmental salinity. Thus, it is crucial to understand how SW-to-FW migration affects the gut microbiota of catadromous fish. To the best of our knowledge, no study has revealed the effects of transfer to hypotonic environments on a catadromous fish microbiota. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of FW transfer on the microbiota and cytokine gene expression in the intestines of juvenile catadromous Asian sea bass. The relationship between the water and the gut microbiota of this euryhaline species was also examined. We found that FW transfer affected both mucosa- and digesta-associated microbiota of Asian sea bass. <i>Plesiomonas</i> and <i>Cetobacterium</i> were dominant in both the mucosa- and digesta-associated microbiota of FW-acclimated sea bass. The pathogenic genera <i>Vibrio</i>, <i>Staphylococcu</i>s, and <i>Acinetobacter</i> were dominant in the SW group. Although dominant fish microbes were present in the water, fish had their own unique microbes. Vitamin B6 metabolism was highly expressed in the FW fish microbiota, whereas arginine, proline, and lipid metabolism were highly expressed in the SW fish microbiota. Additionally, the correlation between cytokine gene expression and microbiota was found to be affected by FW transfer. Taken together, our results demonstrated that FW transfer altered the composition and functions of mucosa- and digesta-associated microbiota of catadromous Asian sea bass intestines, which correlated with cytokine gene expression.

AB  - In this paper we present a suggestion for a sustainability assessment framework using genome editing of salmon as a case study. The salmon farming industry is facing several challenges hindering sustainable production. Genome editing has entered as a tool that can improve selective breeding and feed ingredients in aquaculture, hence providing solutions such as resistance to salmon lice and other pathogens, and sterility reducing interbreeding with wild, threatened stocks. As a goal for aquaculture is that its practices and products contribute to sustainability, the use of genome editing needs to be assessed with regards to sustainability, too. In our work, we draw on three sources of information; strategy and policy documents published by governmental offices and industry organizations; relevant GMO regulations and operationalization reports; and qualitative empirical data from 19 semi-structured interviews with Norwegian key stakeholders, and four semi-structured citizen groups. The findings from our analyses are discussed in relation to a Wedding cake-model for sustainability developed at the Stockholm Resilience Centre based on the UN SDGs and the three pillars of sustainability: biosphere, society, and economy. Analysis of document and interview data shows three main findings, one within each of the sustainability pillars. First, we identified that the biosphere pillar, including protection of the environment and the wild salmon, is the major sustainability issue and therefore important for the assessment of sustainability in the aquaculture industry and for the potential introduction of genome-edited salmon. Second, in the pillar for society the preservation of cultural and natural resources should be included, and in the Norwegian context this includes preserving the Sámi culture reliance on the wild salmon stocks. Third, in the economy pillar animal welfare needs to be included both for efficiency and ethical responsibility in farming. With some adoption to local and national conditions and the fish species in question, the same framework can be used for sustainability assessment of genome edited finfish in general.

AB  - Early marine survival of juvenile salmon is intimately associated with their physiological condition during ocean entry and especially smoltification. Smoltification is a developmental parr-smolt transformation allowing salmon to acquire the trait of seawater tolerance in preparation for marine living. Traditionally, this developmental process has been monitored using gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity or plasma hormones, but gill gene expression can be reliably used. Here, we describe the discovery of candidate genes from gill tissue for staging smoltification using comparisons of microarray studies with particular focus on the commonalities between anadromous Rainbow trout and Sockeye salmon datasets, as well as literature comparison encompassing more species. A subset of 37 candidate genes mainly from the microarray analyses was used for Taq-Man qPCR assay design and their monthly expression patterns were validated using gill samples from four groups, representing three species and two ecotypes: Coho salmon, Sockeye salmon, stream-type Chinook salmon, and ocean-type Chinook salmon. The best smoltification biomarkers, as measured by consistent changes across these four groups, were genes involved in ion regulation, oxygen transport, and immunity. Smoltification gene expression patterns (using the top 10 biomarkers) were confirmed by significant correlations with NKA activity and were associated with changes in body brightness, caudal fin darkness, and caudal peduncle length. We incorporate gene expression patterns of pre-smolt, smolt, and de-smolt trials from acute seawater transfers using a companion study to develop a preliminary seawater tolerance classification model for ocean-type Chinook salmon. This work demonstrates the potential of gene expression biomarkers to stage smoltification and classify juveniles as pre-smolt, smolt, or de-smolt.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the spatial occupancy of marine finfish aquaculture in the European Union (EU), identifies geographical clusters and administrative areas where cage aquaculture development is particularly significant and provides evidence on the interactions between aquaculture and the touristic use of the coastline. Despite the increasing demand for seafood in the EU, its aquaculture is not expanding at the same rate ( FAO, 2014 ), and the low number of new licences issued in recent years is a clear sign of the difficulties of the sector to expand. In this study, Google Earth satellite images and GIS methods were used to map and analyse spatial properties of marine finfish aquaculture sites in the EU. The analysis covers ten member states (Cyprus, Spain, France, Greece, Croatia, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Slovenia, United Kingdom) representing around 95% of EU marine finfish aquaculture production by volume, and Turkey. The results indicate that existing marine aquaculture sites occupy around 230 hectares (ha) in Greece, and 34 ha in UK, which represent respectively 28% and 44% of EU marine finfish production by volume. Considering these very low figures of occupied surface, it is difficult to imagine that the expansion of marine aquaculture in the EU would be constrained by a lack of space in absolute terms. Limitations to growth may be better explained by the competition for space which takes place at the local level with more established coastal economic activities. To examine in particular the interactions with the touristic use of the coastline, the analysis considered the distribution of hotels around the aquaculture sites and found that there is evidence of strong negative spatial interaction up to a distance of 3 km. These quantitative findings corroborate more qualitative considerations on the conflicts affecting the establishment of marine aquaculture in specific coastal regions in USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand described in the literature. Another contribution from this study lies in the identification and mapping of geographical clusters and local administrative units where aquaculture production is particularly significant. Since socio-economic data for the individual aquaculture sites in the EU are not easily accessible, the mapping of EU aquaculture clusters is the prerequisite for further research to understand the local enabling conditions apart from bio-physical conditions which favoured the expansion of aquaculture in specific areas and not in others and identifying examples of best practices for the governance of the sector.

AB  - Aquaculture production is typically located in rural coastal areas where the industry’s economic and environmental impact is highly visible. Aquaculture industry is at times controversial and subject to criticism regarding its externalities. For the industry to continue and expand, it needs support and acceptance from the public. We empirically examine the social support yfor aquaculture production in Norway using survey data, investigating the impact of economic as well as social factors. We find that people living in municipalities with aquaculture activities have a more favorable view of aquaculture production and become more positive with increasing presence of the industry. However, people also report that the economic benefits generated are not fairly shared in the communities where the production occurs. Our results show that proximity to aquaculture activities improve social acceptance, while perceptions of how equitably the economic benefits of aquaculture are distributed within communities also play an important role.

AB  - Surface-based cages are the dominant production technology for the marine finfish aquaculture industry. However, issues such as extreme weather events, poor environmental conditions, interactions with parasites, and conflicts with other coastal users are problematic for surface-based aquaculture. Submerged cages may reduce many of these problems and commercial interest in their use has increased. However, a broad synthesis of research into the effects of submerged culture on fish is lacking. Here, we review the current status of submerged fish farming worldwide, outline the biological challenges that fish with fundamentally different buoyancy control physiologies face in submerged culture, and discuss production benefits and problems that might arise from submerged fish farming. Our findings suggest that fish with closed swim bladders, and fish without swim bladders, may be well-suited to submerged culture. However, for fish with open swim bladders, such as salmonids, submergence is more complex as they require access to surface air to refill their swim bladders and maintain buoyancy. Growth and welfare of open swim bladder fish can be compromised by submergence for long periods due to complications with buoyancy regulation, but the recent addition of underwater air domes to submerged cages can alleviate this issue. Despite this advance, a greater understanding of how to couple advantageous environmental conditions with submerged culture to improve fish growth and welfare over the commercial production cycle is required if submerged cages are to become a viable alternative to surface-based cage aquaculture.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture is one of the world’s fastest growing food producing industries that provides many benefits for producers and society. Its rapid development has raised some concerns related to environmental and economic impacts. Is sustainable development an achievable governance goal for salmon aquaculture? We explore this question by examining key features that may hinder or foster its governability. We base the discussion on a review of the evolution of the industry, current practices and trends, emerging concerns, management challenges, and existing policies and regulations. As a system-to-be-governed, salmon aquaculture is a highly capital-intensive and industrialized commercial activity, with well established technology and markets. The governing system is rather complex, involving multi-layered authorities, international, regional, national, provincial, state and local departments and agencies, and numerous regulations, policies and standards. Environmental issues and concerns related to salmon aquaculture production add to the difficulty in governing this industry to achieve sustainability. All of these have effects on the governability of salmon aquaculture industry, which can be improved through technological improvement, economic-based instruments, and governance solutions.

AB  - <jats:p>One of the key challenges for aquaculture is to reduce “fishing-for-feed”. Alternative fish feeds need to be environmentally assessed to ensure they are sustainable. The present research consisted of an attributional LCA to (i) estimate the impact on salmon farming of a partially algal–insect-based diet vs a conventional fish meal/fish oil-based diet, (ii) identify the contribution of each process to the environmental impacts of the whole fish farming system, and (iii) identify potential improvements in the algal–insect value chain through sensitivity analysis of various algal–insect production pathways. The study shows that use of algal–insect-based feed resulted in a higher impact for most of the environmental impact categories due to fish feed production, particularly for soybean, insect, and algal meal. This points to the need to optimise production chains for new fish feed ingredients. Algal meal production using sugarcane sugar and optimised technology and insect meal using exhaust heat and renewable electricity would improve the environmental performance of salmon farming systems using insect- and algal-based fish feed. Methodological improvements with regard to system C and N cycle, biodiversity, and plastic use should be explored to inform policy making and support the implementation of sustainable future salmon farming innovations.</jats:p>

AB  - Chile is the second largest producer of farmed salmon in the world. After reaching a peak harvest of 631 000 tonnes in 2008, a severe sanitary and production crisis triggered a major legal and operational reorganization, and an imminent expan- sion of the industry into the Aysen Fjords System (AFS). This expansion has caused increasing national and international concern about its potential negative impact upon this pristine area, which holds a mosaic of unique ecosystems and three World Biosphere Reserves. This paper reviews and provides some upper bounds to potential impacts under two feasible production scenarios. It is con- cluded that severe but highly localized mid-term damage to the sea-floor bottom may affect up to 6200 ha. Although this surface area represents only 0.5% of the AFS, the high heterogeneity and limited scientific knowledge of local ecosystems increase the risks of damaging sensitive habitats, communities or populations. While additional inputs of up to 60 000 t of nitrogen and 8000 t of phosphorus can be predicted, the estimation of carrying capacities is a pendant and urgent task to be accomplished in this area. If current escape rates are not reduced, the average number of escaped salmon may exceed 4.4 million individuals each year, able to consume up to 6600 t of pelagic prey from local ecosystems. We recom- mend following a strict precautionary approach, not granting new farming leases until sufficient information about the risk and magnitude of these impacts is obtained and transformed into effective management actions.

AB  - The Cage Aquaculture Particulate Output and Transport (CAPOT) model is an easy to use and flexible farm-scale model that can rapidly estimate particulate waste deposition from fish cage production. This paper describes and tests the model and demonstrates its use for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The spreadsheet-based model gives outputs for waste distribution in a variety of spatial modelling software formats, used for further analysis. The model was tested at a commercial Atlantic cod farm and commercial Atlantic salmon farm under full production conditions. Sediment trap data showed predictions, using actual recorded feed and biomass data, to be 96% (±36%) similar for Atlantic cod beyond 5 m from the cage edge, giving a satisfactory estimate of local benthic impact in the vicinity of the farm. For Atlantic salmon, using estimated production biomass and FCR (Feed Conversion Ratio) to calculate feed input, the model overestimated wastes directly beneath the cages (120% ± 148%) and underestimated beyond 5 m from the cage edge, being 48% (±42%) similar to sediment trap data. CAPOT is a suitable initial, rapid assessment model to give an overview of potential impact of particulate waste from new or expanded fish cage farms, with little operator expertise by a wide range of stakeholders.

AB  - Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is widely applied in the medical, clinical, and nutraceutical fields. However, all commercialized CS is extracted from animal tissues, which is associated with many problems, such as heavy reliance on antibiotics, animal excrement waste and long breeding time. Here, we developed a promising new green route for the de novo biosynthesis of non-animal CS from methanol, a one-carbon compound, using the engineered Pichia pastoris cell factory. Firstly, three exogenous genes, namely kfoC and kfoA from Escherichia coli K4 and tuaD from Bacillus subtilis, were introduced into P. pastoris to construct the chondroitin synthesis pathway, which yielded 5.5 mg L−1 chondroitin. After optimizing the expression of committed enzymes by codon optimization, the production of chondroitin improved by approximately 35-fold to 189.8 mg L−1. Thereafter, 6 kinds of Kozak sequences and 10 different endogenous promoters were compared and applied to achieve the expression of active chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase (41.3 U L−1). After integrating the chondroitin biosynthesis and sulfonation modules, the engineered strain, Pp006, successfully produced 182.0 mg L−1 CSA [GlcA-GalNAc (4S)] with a sulfation degree of 1.1%. We further improved the sulfation degree to 2.8% by strengthening the 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) supply with the overexpression of adenosine-5′-triphosphate sulfurylase and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase. In the fed-batch cultivation, the final titer of CSA reached 2.1 g L−1 and the sulfation degree increased to 4.0%. Moreover, the results suggest that the P. pastoris cell factory could be used as a green route to produce other sulfated glycosaminoglycans.

AB  - Genetic analyses of two unknown but putative Atlantic salmon Salmo salar captured in the Copper River drainage, Alaska, demonstrated the need for validation of morphologically unusual fishes. Mitochondrial DNA sequences (control region and cytochrome b) and data from two nuclear genes [first internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) sequence and growth hormone (GH1) amplification product] indicated that the fish caught in fresh water on the Martin River was a coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, while the other fish caught in the intertidal zone of the Copper River delta near Grass Island was an Atlantic salmon. Determination of unusual or cryptic fish based on limited physical characteristics and expected seasonal spawning run timing will add to the controversy over farmed Atlantic salmon and their potential effects on native Pacific species. It is clear that determination of all putative collections of Atlantic salmon found in Pacific waters requires validation. Due to uncertainty of fish identification in the field using plastic morphometric characters, it is recommended that genetic analyses be part of the validation process.

AB  - The viability of wild Atlantic salmon populations is threatened by genetic introgression from escaped farmed salmon. Farmed Atlantic salmon are genetically improved for important commercial traits and a life in captivity but are poorly adapted to the natural environment. The rate of gene flow from escaped farmed to wild salmon depends on their spawning success and on offspring survival at various life stages. We here investigate relative survival of introgressed juvenile Atlantic salmon (parr) in a river in northern Norway. The studied population has experienced genetic introgression from farmed salmon for about four generations (20 years). We followed two cohorts of parr from the year of hatching (0+) to the age of 2 years (2+). Farmed genetic introgression was quantified at the individual level and on a continuous scale using diagnostic SNPs. Population-level genetic introgression decreased from 0+ to 2+ by 64% (2011 cohort) and 37% (2013 cohort). This change was driven by a 70% (2011 cohort) and 49% (2013 cohort) lower survival from age 0+ to 2+ in introgressed parr compared to parr of wild origin. Our observations show that there is natural selection against genetic introgression with a potential cost of lower productivity.

AB  - The European Union relies on seafood imports to supply growing demand that European production has failed to meet. Politically motivated media reports have denigrated competing imports in favour of local production. While life cycle assessment (LCA) measures global impact of value chains, it often fails to contextualise them. Using LCA, this article takes farmed Scottish Atlantic salmon as a case study of “local” production to identify and map the contributions to global environmental impact. Data on the Scottish salmon value chain were collected by structured survey from a large international feed mill, six farms and a major processor. Secondary data were collected from available literature on feed ingredients and background data from EcoInvent2.2. A mid-point CML2001 approach was adopted focussing on global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential, photo-chemical oxidation potential, consumptive water use and land use. Results were displayed as contribution analyses of materials and processes and mapped geographically using area plots. Far from being a “locally” produced commodity, nearly 50% of the feed ingredients were sourced from South America and less than 25% originated in the UK. It was found that over 90% of the impact to farm-gate was embodied in feed, apart from eutrophication potential which was high at the farm from direct nitrogenous emissions into the marine environment. The majority of impacts do not occur in Scotland, particularly for land and water use, which occur at a more geographically significant level than GWP or AP, which are more global or regional impacts, respectively. High GWP emissions from vegetable-based ingredients were related to soil management and energy intensive processes such as wet milling to produce gluten from wheat and maize, sunflower and rapeseed oil processing. The results show that in an age of globalised commodity trading, concerns around “local” production are often misleading. As consumers try to make more responsible purchase choices, they may be misled over the global impacts their choices are having. There are clearly trade-offs between different feed ingredients, especially regarding substitution of marine ingredients with those of vegetable origin. While marine ingredients perform comparatively well, they are highly limited, and biodiversity impacts of different ingredients are less clear and difficult to compare.

AB  - <jats:p> Antibiotics can be introduced from aquaculture facilities into marine sediments, where they may affect benthic communities and generate antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antibiotics can be used in tandem with antiparasitics, and the effects of their combined usage could affect AMR patterns and transmit antibiotic resistance genes. This study compiles patterns of antibiotic and antiparasitic drug usage from 2016 to 2021 in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia (Canada) and compares them internationally. There is an overall reduction in rates of antibiotic use per fish produced in Canadian aquaculture sites from 2016 to 2021. Compared to other salmon-producing countries, Canadian antibiotic rates per tonne of fish are lower than in Chile, but higher, on average, than in Norway and Scotland. Florfenicol (FLO) and oxytetracycline (OTC) are the prevalent antibiotics used in most salmon-producing countries, including Canada. We also note that &lt;30% of sites used two drugs per year and &lt;18% of sites used three drugs, with most of these sites using one antibiotic and one antiparasitic. There is an increase in FLO and a decrease use in OTC use in Canada, which could be positive environmentally considering FLO's lower dose and environmental persistence. The east and west coasts show comparable antibiotic rates, with an average rate of 78 mg/kg in BC and 76 mg/kg in the Atlantic provinces; however, they have differences in the type of antibiotic (average use of OTC: BC 38 mg/kg vs. Atlantic 214 mg/kg; average use of FLO: BC 40 mg/kg vs. Atlantic 10 mg/kg). Other distinctions between coasts include variation in the timing of treatments, with seasonal use in the Atlantic provinces (May–November) and year-round use in BC. This pattern is likely influenced by differences in water temperature and, subsequently, potential susceptibility to aquatic diseases. Disease prevalence and veterinarian choice/preferred treatments are factors that, we hypothesize, may impact treatment choice; however, additional information is required to adequately comment on this point. This data compilation includes spatial descriptions that could be used for area prioritization in future studies. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Agricultural cultural heritage is crucial in advancing comprehensive rural revitalization. The Yangtze River Basin is rich in biodiversity and abundant in fishery cultural resources. The cultural resources not only reflect the ecological wisdom of harmonious coexistence and the human–land relationship between humans and nature but also provide critical cultural support for rural revitalization and watershed sustainable development. This study investigates the spatial distribution, influencing factors, and historical evolution of fishery cultural resources in the Yangtze River Basin. The highest proportions of significant resources are found in fishery engineering and landscapes, culinary flavors, fishery customs, dances, fishery gear, and poetry. By analyzing 14 categories of fishery cultural resources and 157 national and provincial intangible cultural heritage items, this study reveals a significant geographical clustering of these resources in the mid-lower reaches, particularly around the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake Basin, Wuhan and Dongting Lake, and the lower reaches of the Taihu Lake Basin. This study underscores the role of natural geographical conditions, aquatic biodiversity, socio-economic factors, and historical–cultural backgrounds in the distribution and evolution of fishery cultural resources, with these factors interacting dynamically. By advocating for a comprehensive approach to coordinating fishery culture preservation with rural revitalization, this study outlines a multidimensional strategy for the preservation and sustainable development of fishery cultural resources.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The aims of this review are to describe the role of ‘blue‐food production’ (animals, plants and algae harvested from freshwater and marine environments) within a circular bioeconomy, discuss how such a framework can help the sustainability and resilience of aquaculture and to summarise key examples of novel nutrient sources that are emerging in the field of fed‐aquaculture species. Aquaculture now provides &gt;50% of the global seafood supply, a share that is expected to increase to at least 60% within the next decade. Aquaculture is an important tool for reducing resource consumption in global protein production and increasing resilience to climate change and other global disruptions (i.e. pandemics, geo‐political instability). Importantly, blue foods also provide essential nutrition for a growing human population. Blue foods are helping to help the global goal of ‘zero hunger’ (United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 2) while reducing the dependency on finite natural resources but further refinement and new solutions are needed to make the industry more ‘circular’ and sustainable, particularly with respect to sourcing raw materials for aquafeeds. This review describes the feed resources that are available or may be created within a circular bioeconomy framework, their role within the framework and in aquaculture and ultimately, how these resources contribute to de‐risking and establishing a resilient aquaculture production chain.</jats:p>

AB  - Oysters represent an important portion of the world’s total aquaculture production. In recent years, in Italy, oyster farming has progressively increased its role in the economic growth of the aquaculture sector and still has great potential for growth. As in any other production, oyster farming generates environmental impacts over an oyster’s life cycle, due to material, energy, fuel, and water use. The aim of this work was to carry out a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of fresh oysters of commercial size produced in the Po delta area, northern Italy. Two scenarios were considered. The current scenario provides for oyster seed purchasing from France and transport to Italy, whereas the alternative scenario includes in situ seed production in order to realize a complete local and traceable supply chain. Eco-indicator® 99-H and ReCiPe® midpoint (H) v.1.12 were used to perform the impact assessments. The overall impacts of the two scenarios were very similar and indicated that the main hotspots were the fattening and prefattening phases of farming, which were common in both scenarios. Focusing the analysis on the first stages, transport from France had a greater impact than did local seed production, emphasizing the importance of a short supply chain in aquaculture production.

AB  - <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. are the most commonly found bacteria in food-processing environments due to properties such as a high growth rate at low temperatures, a high tolerance of antimicrobial agents, and biofilm formation. In this study, a set of <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates originating from cleaned and disinfected surfaces in a salmon processing facility were screened for biofilm formation at 12 °C. A high variation in biofilm formation between the isolates was observed. Selected isolates, in both planktonic and biofilm states, were tested for resistance/tolerance to a commonly used disinfectant (peracetic acid-based) and antibiotic florfenicol. Most isolates showed a much higher tolerance in the biofilm state than in the planktonic state. In a multi-species biofilm experiment with five <i>Pseudomonas</i> strains with and without a <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> strain, the <i>Pseudomonas</i> biofilm appeared to aid the survival of <i>L. monocytogenes</i> cells after disinfection, underscoring the importance of controlling the bacterial load in food-processing environments.

AB  - Public health is facing a new challenge due to the increased bacterial resistance to most of the conventional antibacterial agents. Inadequate use of antibiotics in the Chilean aquaculture industry leads to the generation of multidrug resistance bacteria. Many fish pathogenic bacteria produce biofilm upon various sources of stress such as antibiotics, which provides several survival advantages for the bacterial life in community and can constitute a reservoir of pathogens in the marine environment. Being florfenicol a broad-spectrum antibiotic commonly used to treat infections in aquaculture, the aim of this study was to assess whether this antibiotic modulates in vitro the biofilm formation in several isolates of Piscirickettsia salmonis. Standard antibiotic-micro broth 96-flat well plates were used to determinate the minimal inhibitory concentration of florfenicol in eight different P. salmonis isolates. In vitro findings, with P. salmonis growing in the presence and absence of the antibiotic, exhibited a statistically significantly increase (p < .05) in biofilm formation in all the bacterial isolates cultivated with sub-MIC (defined as the half of the minimal inhibitory concentration in the presence of antibiotic) of florfenicol compared with controls (antibiotic-free broth). In conclusion, sub-MIC of florfenicol induced an increased biofilm formation in all P. salmonis isolates tested.

AB  - This article presents empirical evidence on the effect of the opportunity cost of schooling on youths' educational investment in Norway. The findings suggest that increases in the demand for low-skilled labor originating from the Norwegian salmon farming industry's expansion harms upper secondary graduation rates. The salmon farming industry is an important workplace for low-skilled labor in Norway, and the stock of farming concessions issued by the central government increased by 25 percent in the period 1994-2006. Endogeneity concerns are handled using instruments for the industry's size based on geographical characteristics, such as the coastline of islands and variation in ocean temperature and international salmon prices. Using data on wages for low- and high-skilled workers, I find that salmon farming changes mainly affected low-skilled wages. This confirms that the growth in the industry has increased the demand for low-skilled labor. The findings from a structural model on demand for low-skilled labor, the relative wage gap between low- and high-skilled workers, and upper secondary school graduation support human capital theory.

AB  - Equations were developed through multiple regression analysis (MRA) to explain the variability of potential environmental impacts (PEIs) estimated by life cycle assessment (LCA). The case studied refers to the production of seabass in basic offshore fish farms. Contribution analysis showed that the components of the system which most influence the potential environmental impacts are the feed (54% of the overall impact) and the fuel consumed by vessels operating in the farm (23%). Feed and fuel varied widely from one fish farm to another due to different factors, such as the efficiency of the feeding system used in each of them, or the distance from the harbor to the farm. Therefore, a number of scenarios (13) were simulated with different values of both factors and the results of the PEI were fitted by MRA to the model: PEI = a + b × Feed + c × Fuel. For all the PEIs, the regression coefficients were significant (p < 0.05) and R2 was 1. These equations allow us to estimate simply and quickly very different scenarios that reflect the reality of different farms at the present time, but also future scenarios based on the implementation of technologies that will decrease both feed and fuel consumption.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada, negatively impact the salmon aquaculture industry. One disease of interest to salmon aquaculture is Net Pen Liver Disease (NPLD), which induces severe liver damage and is believed to be caused by the exposure to microcystins (MCs). To address the lack of information about algal toxins in BC marine environments and the risk they pose, this study investigated the presence of MCs and other toxins at aquaculture sites. Sampling was carried out using discrete water samples and Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) samplers from 2017-2019. All 283 SPATT samples and all 81 water samples tested positive for MCs. Testing for okadaic acid (OA) and domoic acid (DA) occurred in 66 and 43 samples, respectively, and all samples were positive for the toxin tested. Testing for dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) (20 samples), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) (20 samples), and yessotoxin (YTX) (17 samples) revealed that all samples were positive for the tested toxins. This study revealed the presence of multiple co-occurring toxins in BC's coastal waters and the levels detected in this study were below the regulatory limits for health and recreational use. This study expands our limited knowledge of algal toxins in coastal BC and shows that further studies are needed to understand the risks they pose to marine fisheries and ecosystems.

AB  - The impact of climate change on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems tends to become more progressively pronounced and devastating over the years. The sector of aquaculture is severely affected by natural abiotic factors, on account of climate change, that lead to various undesirable phenomena, including aquatic species mortalities and decreased productivity owing to oxidative and thermal stress of the reared organisms. Novel innovative technologies, such as aquaponics that are based on the co-cultivation of freshwater fish with plants in a sustainable manner under the context of controlled abiotic factors, represent a promising tool for mitigating the effect of climate change on reared fish. The rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) constitutes one of the major freshwater-reared fish species, contributing to the national economies of numerous countries, and more specifically, to regional development, supporting mountainous areas of low productivity. However, it is highly vulnerable to climate change effects, mainly due to the concrete raceways, in which it is reared, that are constructed on the flow-through of rivers and are, therefore, dependent on water's physical properties. The current review study evaluates the suitability, progress, and challenges of developing innovative and sustainable aquaponic systems to rear rainbow trout in combination with the cultivation of plants. Although not commercially developed to a great extent yet, research has shown that the rainbow trout is a valuable experimental model for aquaponics that may be also commercially exploited in the future. In particular, abiotic factors required in rainbow trout farming along, with the high protein proportion required in the ratios due to the strict carnivorous feeding behavior, result in high nitrate production that can be utilized by plants as a source of nitrogen in an aquaponic system. Intensive farming of rainbow trout in aquaponic systems can be controlled using digital monitoring of the system parameters, mitigating the obstacles originating from extreme temperature fluctuations.

AB  - While progress has been made in surveying the oceans to understand microbial and viral communities, the coastal ocean and, specifically, estuarine waters, where the effects of anthropogenic activity are greatest, remain partially understudied. The coastal waters of Northern Patagonia are of interest since this region experiences high-density salmon farming as well as other disturbances such as maritime transport of humans and cargo. Here, we hypothesized that viral and microbial communities from the Comau Fjord would be distinct from those collected in global surveys yet would have the distinctive features of microbes from coastal and temperate regions. We further hypothesized that microbial communities will be functionally enriched in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in general and in those related to salmon farming in particular. Here, the analysis of metagenomes and viromes obtained for three surface water sites showed that the structure of the microbial communities was distinct in comparison to global surveys such as the Tara Ocean, though their composition converges with that of cosmopolitan marine microbes belonging to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. Similarly, viral communities were also divergent in structure and composition but matched known viral members from North America and the southern oceans. Microbial communities were functionally enriched in ARGs dominated by beta-lactams and tetracyclines, bacitracin, and the group macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) but were not different from other communities from the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and Southern Oceans. Similarly, viral communities were characterized by exhibiting protein clusters similar to those described globally (Tara Oceans Virome); however, Comau Fjord viromes displayed up to 50% uniqueness in their protein content. Altogether, our results indicate that microbial and viral communities from the Comau Fjord are a reservoir of untapped diversity and that, given the increasing anthropogenic impacts in the region, they warrant further study, specifically regarding resilience and resistance against antimicrobials and hydrocarbons.

AB  - Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) is a salmonid that is well adapted to cold waters and is commonly farmed in open net cages. A breeding program has enabled a relatively large production in Sweden, providing a continuous supply of fresh fish to the market. Despite expansions and improvements of the Arctic charr farming industry during the last decade, there are still sustainability challenges to overcome. 

This doctoral thesis explores various methods for improving the sustainability of Arctic charr farming, such as alternative protein sources in the feed, a shortened production cycle through selective breeding and an adaptive feeding management model. 

A new feed composition, containing a protein mixture with ingredients that are not attractive for human consumption, was evaluated for Arctic charr. The feed consisted of Baltic Sea decontaminated fishmeal (Sprattus sprattus and Clupea harengus), Baltic Sea blue mussel meal (Mytilus edulis) and baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The new feed resulted in lower growth compared with fish fed a commercial-type control feed, likely due to a reduced digestibility caused by the baker’s yeast. However, a self-selection study revealed a preference for the new feed over the control feed. Additionally, consumers could not distinguish between fish that had been fed the new feed or the control feed. Possible family effects that the new feed may have on growth were also investigated, showing that selection for high growth on a commercial-type feed would also benefit a higher growth capacity on the new feed.
 
Selective breeding of Arctic charr had clear positive effects on growth. After adjusting for changes of environmental factors within the hatchery, the growth improvement from the first generation to the current seventh generation was 11 % per generation and production time has been shortened by ten months. Selective breeding also affected seasonal growth patterns and Arctic charr from the seventh generation grew more during winter than previously, although the largest weight improvement between generations occurred during summer. A new growth capacity, and pattern, demands an adaptive feeding management model so that feed waste and environmental impacts can be minimized. A new model on the digestible energy need of Arctic charr and a seasonal growth capacity factor were developed and can together be used to calculate the daily feed allowance during different periods of the growth season.

AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) feeds have changed drastically in their composition from being predominantly marine-based to plant-based. This has altered the dietary supply and availability of micro-nutrients to Atlantic salmon. The impact of graded inclusion levels of a nutrient package (NP) comprising of 25 different micro-nutrients were studied in Atlantic salmon parr in freshwater (Trial 1) and post-smolts in seawater (Trial 2). In brief, the NP was included from 0 to 400%, where 100% corresponded to the recommendation by the National Research Council, 2011. Micro-nutrients, namely Zn, Mn, Se, Cu, Fe, Co, I and vitamin D3 were included in the NP with the objective of (re)evaluating the dietary need to meet the requirement of Atlantic salmon parr and post-smolt, when fed low fish meal, plant ingredient-based diets. Responses in apparent availability coefficient (AAC), whole body and vertebrae mineral concentrations, and retention were analysed. AAC of Cu, Mn, Se and Zn responded in a quadratic fashion with an increase in NP from 0 to 400% in freshwater parr; AAC could not be measured in post-smolt salmon. The whole-body concentration of Zn, Se, Co and I in Atlantic salmon parr were significantly affected by increasing NP inclusion; the same was observed for Zn, Se and Co in post-smolt Atlantic salmon. Vertebrae mineral concentration as the response criterion was non-responsive in parr; whereas, in post-smolt, Co had a linear increase, while Zn and Se showed a non-linear increase upon 0 to 400 NP inclusion. Zinc concentration and activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in vertebrae indicated increased bone resorption in post-smolt Atlantic salmon; TRAP activity increased linearly with NP inclusion in post-smolt, but not in parr. Significant correlations between Zn and Se were observed in AAC and vertebral concentrations, indicating an interaction in intestinal uptake and vertebral deposition. Overall, Atlantic salmon parr held in freshwater were able to satisfy the requirement for the trace minerals Zn, Mn, Se, Cu, and Fe through supply from 100-150 NP, corresponding to 101-132, 47-63, 0.6-0.8, 12-16 and 150-166 mg kg -1, respectively; for iodine, dietary supply from 150-200 NP, corresponding to 0.7-1.6 mg kg-1, was required. In the seawater, Atlantic salmon post-smolt, in general, required micro-minerals and vitamin D3 levels as supplied through 150-200 NP, corresponding to 140-177, Zn; 61-67, Mn; 0.9-1, Se; 14-16, Cu; and vitamin D3, 0.06-0.09 mg kg -1 to fulfil the requirement, except for Cu which was satisfied at 100-150 NP, equivalent to 13-14 mg kg -1 diet.

AB  - We study forwards and European call options, which are written on a nonstorable renewable resource. Examples of such derivatives in form of futures on fresh catch of wild salmon for the United States and the recently created Fish Pool market in Norway, where futures on a composite of wild catch and farmed salmon are traded, will be discussed. We approach the problem of pricing these contracts from first principles, starting off by modeling the dynamics of the resource reserves, and assuming that in approximation resource extraction is managed as open access. We derive formulas for the forward price of the renewable resource as well as European call options written on it.

AB  - Abstract Aquaculture governance can be challenging as a number of stakeholders have different objectives and visions for the industry. A license is an important tool in ensuring an orderly development of an industry, providing rights as well as obligations. However, the constraints imposed by a license can also prevent desirable activities. In the Norwegian aquaculture industry this has been addressed by creating special purpose license to promote some activities such as education and research, but which are operated in collaboration with commercial farms. While these licenses are not regarded as a part of the industry's regulatory system, the paper shows that that this can be a challenge as 17% of the current production capacity is in the form of special purpose licenses. This raises the questions of how well the special purpose license achieve their objectives or whether they undermine the regulatory system. This challenge is particularly pertinent in an industry with high profitability and strong barriers to further growth.

AB  - Abstract National authorities in many countries advise their populations to eat more seafood, for health and sometimes for environmental purposes, but give little guidance as to what type of seafood should be consumed. The large diversity in species and production methods results in variability both in the nutritional content and in the environmental performance of seafoods. More targeted dietary advice for sustainable seafood consumption requires a better understanding of the relative nutritional benefits against environmental costs of various types of seafood. This study analyzes the combined climate and nutritional performance of seafood commonly consumed in Sweden, originating all over the world. Nutrient density scores, assessed by seven alternative methods, are combined with species- technology- and origin-specific greenhouse gas emission data for 37 types of seafood. An integrated score indicates which seafood products provide the greatest nutritional value at the lowest climate costs and hence should be promoted from this perspective. Results show that seafoods consumed in Sweden differ widely in nutritional value as well as climate impact and that the two measures are not correlated across all species. Dietary changes towards increased consumption of more seafood choices where a correlation exists (e.g. pelagic species like sprat, herring and mackerel) would benefit both health and climate. Seafoods with a higher climate impact in relation to their nutritional value (e.g. shrimp, Pangasius and plaice) should, on the other hand, not be promoted in dietary advice. The effect of individual nutrients and implications of different nutrient density scores is evaluated. This research is a first step towards modelling the joint nutritional and climate benefits of seafood as a concrete baseline for policy-making, e.g. in dietary advice. It should be followed up by modelling other species, including environmental toxins in seafood in the nutrition score, and expanding to cover other environmental aspects.

AB  - Caligus rogercresseyi, commonly known as sea louse, is an ectoparasite copepod that impacts the salmon aquaculture in Chile, causing losses of hundreds of million dollars per year. This pathogen is mainly controlled by immersion baths with delousing drugs, which can lead to resistant traits selection in lice populations. Bioassays are commonly used to assess louse drug sensitivity, but the current procedures may mask relevant molecular responses. This study aimed to discover novel coding genes and non-coding RNAs that could evidence drug sensitivity at the genomic level. Sea lice samples from populations with contrasting sensitivity to delousing drugs were collected. Bioassays using azamethiphos, cypermethrin, and deltamethrin drugs were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity and to collect samples for RNA-sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing was conducted on samples exposed to each drug to evaluate the presence of coding and non-coding RNAs associated with the response of these compounds. The results revealed specific transcriptome patterns in lice exposed to azamethiphos, deltamethrin, and cypermethrin drugs. Enrichment analyses of Gene Ontology terms showed specific biological processes and molecular functions associated with each delousing drug analyzed. Furthermore, novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified in C. rogercresseyi and tightly linked to differentially expressed coding genes. A significant correlation between gene transcription patterns and phenotypic effects was found in lice collected from different salmon farms with contrasting drug treatment efficacies. The significant correlation among gene transcription patterns with the historical background of drug sensitivity suggests novel molecular mechanisms of pharmacological resistance in lice populations.

AB  - The naturally occurring ectoparasite salmon lice (Lepeophtherirus salmonis) poses a great challenge for the salmon farming industry, as well as for wild salmonids in the Northern hemisphere. To better control the infestation pressure and protect the production, there is a need to provide fish farmers with sensitive and efficient tools for rapid early detection and monitoring of the parasitic load. This can be achieved by targeting L. salmonis DNA in environmental samples. Here, we developed and tested a new L. salmonis specific DNA-based assay (qPCR assay) for detection and quantification from seawater samples using an analytical pipeline compatible with the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) for autonomous water sample analysis of gene targets. Specificity of the L. salmonis qPCR assay was demonstrated through in-silico DNA analyses covering sequences of different L. salmonis isolates. Seawater was spiked with known numbers of nauplii and copepodite free-swimming (planktonic) stages of L. salmonis to investigate the relationship with the number of marker gene copies (MGC). Finally, field samples collected at different times of the year in the vicinity of a salmon production farm in Western Norway were analyzed for L. salmonis detection and quantification. The assay specificity was high and a high correlation between MGC and planktonic stages of L. salmonis was established in the laboratory conditions. In the field, L. salmonis DNA was consequently detected, but with MGC number below that expected for one copepodite or nauplii. We concluded that only L. salmonis tissue or eDNA residues were detected. This novel study opens for a fully automatized L. salmonis DNA quantification using ESP robotic to monitor the parasitic load, but the challenge remains the adequate sampling of a volume of seawater sufficiently large to be representative of outbreaks and load around fish farms.

AB  - This study represents the Wrst determination of lipids and fatty acids in Wsh scales. Scales collected from groups of Atlantic salmon reared on Wsh farms and in experimental tanks were analyzed by chromatography. The complete suite of fatty acids normally found in marine organisms was detected in the scales, with the following fatty acids dominating: 16:0, 18:0, 18:1n9, 20:5n3, 22:6n3 and 24:1n9. Scales contained relatively high levels of furan fatty acids, and the level of cholesterol (2.5-5 mg/g tissue) was much higher than the levels found in the edible parts of marine Wshes (0.2-1 mg/g tissue). The fatty acid proWle of scales was distinct between groups of salmon originating from diVerent commercial strains reared on the same farm, between salmon groups originating from the same strains but reared at diVerent farms, and between groups of fed and unfed salmon in experimental tanks. Together, these data indicate that the fatty acid composition of Wsh scales is dependent upon both environmental and genetic factors. The fatty acid composition of Wsh scales may be used in stock/population identiWcation, for example identiWcation of escaped Atlantic salmon to farm of origin.

AB  - This study examined fertilization rates, survival and early life-trait differences of pure farm, wild and first generation (F1) hybrid origin embryos after crossing farm and wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Results show that despite a trend towards higher in vitro fertilization success for wild females, differences in fertilization success in river water are not significantly different among crosses. In a hatchery environment, wild females' progeny (pure wild and hybrids with wild maternal parent) hatched 7-11 days earlier than pure farm crosses and hybrids with farm maternal parents. In addition, pure wild progeny had higher total lengths (LT ) at hatch than pure farm crosses and hybrids. Directions in trait differences need to be tested in a river environment, but results clearly show the maternal influence on early stages beyond egg-size differences. Differences in LT were no longer significant at 70 days post hatch (shortly after the onset of exogenous feeding) showing the need to investigate later developmental stages to better assess somatic growth disparities due to genetic differences. Higher mortality rates of the most likely hybrids (farm female × wild male hybrids) at egg and fry stages and their delayed hatch suggest that these F1 hybrids might be less likely to survive the early larval stages than wild stocks.

AB  - Population genetics has been recognized as a key component of policy development for fisheries and conservation management and aquaculture development. This study aims to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of native cobia (Rachycentron canadum) in the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea, establishing the existing population distributions and contributing information to aid in the development of policy, prior to extensive aquaculture development. Microsatellite analysis of natural cobia populations in these two ocean basins shows similar levels of gene diversity at 0.844 and 0.837, respectively. All populations and almost all microsatellite loci studied show significant heterozygote deficiency. Genetic differentiation between local populations is low and mostly not significant (R
 ST = −0.0109 to 0.0066). The population shows no marked structure over the long geographic barrier of the Thai–Malay peninsula, either when analyzed using pairwise genetic differences or evaluated without predefined populations using STRUCTURE. Additionally, a Mantel test shows no evidence of isolation by distance between the population samples. The significant heterozygote deficiency at most of the loci studied could be explained by the possibility of null alleles. Alternatively, given the behavior of forming small spawning aggregations, seasonal migration, and hitchhiking on large marine animals, the population genetics could be complex. The population of cobia at each location in Thai waters may be inbred, as a result of breeding between relatives, which would reduce heterozygosity relative to Hardy–Weinberg frequencies, while some of these populations could be making long distance migrations followed by admixture between resident and transient groups. This migration would cause population homogeneity in allele frequencies on a larger geographic scale. The results suggest that fisheries management for this species should be considered at both national and international levels, and until the possibility of local adaptation is fully investigated, policy development should apply the precautionary principle to ensure the preservation of genetic diversity and the sustainability of local and regional fisheries.

AB  - Captive breeding and release programs, widely used to supplement populations of declining species, minimize juvenile mortality to achieve rapid population growth. However, raising animals in benign environments may promote traits that are adaptive in captivity but maladaptive in nature. In chinook salmon, hatchery rearing relaxes natural selection favoring large eggs, allowing fecundity selection to drive exceptionally rapid evolution of small eggs. Trends toward small eggs are also evident in natural populations heavily supplemented by hatcheries, but not in minimally supplemented populations. Unintentional selection in captivity can lead to rapid changes in critical life-history traits that may reduce the success of supplementation or reintroduction programs.

AB  - <jats:p>Projections indicate aquaculture will produce 106 million tonnes of fish by 2030, emphasizing the need for efficient and sustainable practices. New technologies can provide a valuable tool for adequate fish farm management. The aim of this paper is to explore the factors affecting fish well-being, the design of control systems for aquaculture, and the proposal of a smart system based on algorithms to improve efficiency and sustainability. First, we identify the domains affecting fish well-being: the production domain, abiotic domain, biotic domain, and control systems domain. Then, we evaluate the interactions between elements present in each domain to evaluate the key aspects to be monitored. This is conducted for two types of fish farming facilities: cages in the sea and recirculating aquaculture systems. A total of 86 factors have been identified, of which 17 and 32 were selected to be included in monitoring systems for sea cages and recirculating aquaculture systems. Then, a series of algorithms are proposed to optimize fish farming management. We have included predefined control algorithms, energy-efficient algorithms, fault tolerance algorithms, data management algorithms, and a smart control algorithm. The smart control algorithms have been proposed considering all the aforementioned factors, and two scenarios are simulated to evaluate the benefits of the smart control algorithm. In the simulated case, the turbidity when the control algorithm is used represents 12.5% of the turbidity when not used. Their use resulted in a 35% reduction in the energy consumption of the aerator system when the smart control was implemented.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract After two decades of research on sustainable intensification (SI), namely securing food production on less environmental cost, heterogeneous understandings and perspectives prevail in a broad and partly fragmented scientific literature. Structuring and consolidating contributions to provide practice-oriented guidelines are lacking. The objectives of this study are to (1) comprehensively explore the academic SI literature, (2) propose an implementation-oriented conceptual framework, and (3) demonstrate its applicability for region-specific problem settings. In a systematic literature review of 349 papers covering the international literature of 20 years of SI research, we identified SI practices and analysed temporal, spatial and disciplinary trends and foci. Based on key SI practices, a conceptual framework was developed differentiating four fields of action from farm to regional and landscape scale and from land use to structural optimisation. Its applicability to derive region-specific SI solutions was successfully tested through stakeholder processes in four European case studies. Disciplinary boundaries and the separation of the temporal and spatial strands in the literature prevent a holistic address of SI. This leads to the dominance of research describing SI practices in isolation, mainly on the farm scale. Coordinated actions on the regional scale and the coupling of multiple practices are comparatively underrepresented. Results from the case studies demonstrate that implementation is extremely context-sensitive and thus crucially depends on the situational knowledge of farmers and stakeholders. Although, there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution, practitioners in all regions identified the need for integrated solutions and common action to implement suitable SI strategies at the regional landscape level and in local ecosystems.

AB  - A scoping project was funded by the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2017 on the health and safety of aquaculture workers. This project developed a template covering basic types of aquaculture production, health and safety hazards and risks, and related data on injuries and occupational ill health, regulations, social welfare conditions, and labour and industry activity in the sector. Profiles using the template were then produced for key aquaculture regions and nations across the globe where information could be obtained. These revealed both the scale and depth of occupational safety and health (OSH) challenges in terms of data gaps, a lack of or poor risk assessment and management, inadequate monitoring and regulation, and limited information generally about aquaculture OSH. Risks are especially high for offshore/marine aquaculture workers. Good practice as well as barriers to improving aquaculture OSH were noted. The findings from the profiles were brought together in an analysis of current knowledge on injury and work-related ill health, standards and regulation, non-work socioeconomic factors affecting aquaculture OSH, and the role of labour and industry in dealing with aquaculture OSH challenges. Some examples of governmental and labour, industry and non-governmental organisation good practice were identified. Some databases on injury and disease in the sector and research initiatives that solved problems were noted. However, there are many challenges especially in rural and remote areas across Asia but also in the northern hemisphere that need to be addressed. Action now is possible based on the knowledge available, with further research an important but secondary objective.

AB  - Notably, 56 worldwide experts gathered for the Antimicrobial Assessment on Global Aquaculture Production (AGAP) series of workshops to (1) evaluate the current state of knowledge on antimicrobial use and identify existing gaps; (2) formulate strategies to identify ecologically relevant impact indicators and establish thresholds for assessment; (3) identify pivotal socioeconomic factors and effective governance mechanisms essential for implementing monitoring practices in aquaculture and extending them across sectors and countries for aquaculture sustainability; (4) develop pathways to enhance our comprehension between antibiotic use in aquaculture and antimicrobial resistance; and (5) explore potential antibiotic monitoring tools that can be universally adapted and implemented across region and sectors. The main outcomes were a roadmap for establishing investigation priorities on the relevant topics regarding antibiotic use in aquaculture, socioeconomic drivers for using antibiotics and behaviors that need more robust and transparent regulatory frameworks to guide farmers, training on antimicrobial use, and access to veterinarians and extension services agents for education. Overall, the workshop evidenced the power of collaboration in addressing complex global challenges to achieve sustainable aquaculture. Despite diligent efforts, some constraints may have inadvertently narrowed the possibility of having more experts and left some pertinent topics unaddressed, but they are needed in the discussion.

AB  - Although seemingly rare, adverse reactions to veterinary products do occur. These may arise from inadvertent exposure during use or as a result of occupational accidents. They are often mild in nature and include adverse effects such as minor skin reactions. However, more serious reactions may occur, and they are not restricted to the effects of the veterinary medicines themselves. For example, high-pressure injection injuries may occur as a result of accidents occurring during animal vaccination operations. This paper reviews some of these events, mentions where appropriate the regulatory actions taken, and describes some of the measures used to minimise such effects in the future, and serves to bring the issues discussed here to the attention of pharmacologists, pharmacoepidemiologists and others who train those who use veterinary medicinal products.

AB  - Piscine Reovirus (PRV), the putative causative agent of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), is widely distributed in both farmed and wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in Norway. While HSMI is a common and commercially important disease in farmed Atlantic salmon, the presence of PRV has so far not been associated with HSMI related lesions in wild salmon. Factors associated with PRV-infection were investigated in returning Atlantic salmon captured in Norwegian rivers. A multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model confirmed clustering within rivers and demonstrated that PRV-infection is associated with life-history, sex, catch-year and body length as a proxy for sea-age. Escaped farmed salmon (odds ratio/OR: 7.32, p<0.001) and hatchery-reared salmon (OR: 1.69 p=0.073) have higher odds of being PRV-infected than wild Atlantic salmon. Male salmon have double odds of being PRV infected compared to female salmon (OR: 2.11, p<0.001). Odds of being PRV-infected increased with body-length measured as decimetres (OR: 1.20, p=0.004). Since body length and sea-age are correlated (r=0.85 p<0.001), body length serves as a proxy for sea-age, meaning that spending more years in sea increases the odds of being PRV-infected.

AB  - Each year, hundreds of thousands of domesticated farmed Atlantic salmon escape into the wild. In Norway, which is the world’s largest commercial producer, many native Atlantic salmon populations have experienced large numbers of escapees on the spawning grounds for the past 15–30 years. In order to study the potential genetic impact, we conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of 3049 fish from 21 populations throughout Norway, sampled in the period 1970–2010. Based upon the analysis of 22 microsatellites, individual admixture, FST and increased allelic richness revealed temporal genetic changes in six of the populations. These changes were highly significant in four of them. For example, 76% and 100% of the fish comprising the contemporary samples for the rivers Vosso and Opo were excluded from their respective historical samples at P = 0.001. Based upon several genetic parameters, including simulations, genetic drift was excluded as the primary cause of the observed genetic changes. In the remaining 15 populations, some of which had also been exposed to high numbers of escapees, clear genetic changes were not detected. Significant population genetic structuring was observed among the 21 populations in the historical (global FST = 0.038) and contemporary data sets (global FST = 0.030), although significantly reduced with time (P = 0.008). This reduction was especially distinct when looking at the six populations displaying temporal changes (global FST dropped from 0.058 to 0.039, P = 0.006). We draw two main conclusions: 1. The majority of the historical population genetic structure throughout Norway still appears to be retained, suggesting a low to modest overall success of farmed escapees in the wild; 2. Genetic introgression of farmed escapees in native salmon populations has been strongly population-dependent, and it appears to be linked with the density of the native population.

AB  - Aquaculture is a globally expanding industry that contributes to feeding an increasing global population. Shellfish cultivation is one of the largest sectors of aquaculture and one of the few food productions that have the potential capacity of acting as carbon sink. In fact, >90 % of bivalve shells are calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), synthetized during biocalcification process, which incorporates a molecule of CO<sub>2</sub>. Manila clam (Venerupis philippinarum, Adams & Reeves, 1850) and Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Lamarck, 1819) are two of the major groups of cultivated shellfish. Our aim was to assess the potential role of those two bivalve species in the overall marine carbon balance using an ecosystem approach, and to evaluate if they can be definitely regarded as carbon sink. The contribution to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (as CO<sub>2</sub> eq./kg of fresh products) due to mollusk farming has been also calculated as carbon-source term by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA is nowadays the most shared and accepted tool for evaluating the environmental impacts of aquaculture productions. As a case study, the Sacca di Goro coastal lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) has been considered, because it is the premier site in Europe for clam farming, and one of the most important for mussels. Our study has shown that for each kilogram of harvested and packaged clams and mussels, shell formation throughout the mollusk growth allows to permanently capture 254 and 146 g of CO<sub>2</sub>, in the face of 22 and 55 g CO<sub>2</sub> eq. emitted for farming, respectively. As a result, clams and mussel aquaculture could be considered as a carbon sink, with a net carbon capture capacity of 233 and 91 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kg of fresh product, respectively. In a wider context, bivalve aquaculture could be included in the carbon trading system and played a role towards the carbon-neutral economy.

AB  - Abstract The marine survival of juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch from the time they enter the Strait of Georgia in mid-May to the time of our trawl survey in mid-September declined from an average of about 15% in 1998 to approximately 1% in 2007. Early marine survival rates for juvenile coho salmon have been consistently low (<5%) since 2002, and the rate of decline in early marine survival was greater for hatchery fish than for wild fish. This suggests that hatchery coho salmon are perhaps less able to survive than wild fish in the current marine ecosystem. The steady decline in total marine survival for coho salmon over the past four decades coincided with a warming of the Strait of Georgia, where both sea surface and sea bottom temperatures have increased by approximately 1°C since 1970. Another factor that appears to have contributed to the decline in early marine survival since the late 1990s is an increase in the number of days with an average sustained wind strength greater than 25 km/h.

AB  - Food availability can influence the nutritional and social dynamics within and among species. Our investigation focused on grizzly and black bears in coastal British Columbia, Canada, where recent and dramatic declines in their primary prey (salmon) raise concerns about potentially negative effects on bear physiology. We examined how salmon availability relates to stress and reproductive hormones in coastal grizzly (n = 69) and black bears (n = 68) using cortisol and testosterone. In hair samples from genotyped individuals, we quantified salmon consumption using stable isotope analysis and hormone levels by enzyme immunoassay. To estimate the salmon biomass available to each bear, we developed a spatially explicit approach based on typical bear home-range sizes. Next, we compared the relative importance of salmon consumption and salmon availability on hormone levels in male bears using an information theoretical approach. Cortisol in grizzly bears was higher in individuals that consumed less salmon, possibly reflecting nutritional stress. In black bears, cortisol was better predicted by salmon availability than salmon consumption; specifically, individuals in areas and years with low salmon availability showed higher cortisol levels. This indicates that cortisol in black bears is more strongly influenced by the socially competitive environment mediated by salmon availability than by nutritional requirements. In both species, testosterone generally decreased with increasing salmon availability, possibly reflecting a less competitive environment when salmon were abundant. Differences between species could relate to different nutritional requirements, social densities and competitive behaviour and/or habitat use. We present a conceptual model to inform further investigations in this and other systems. Our approach, which combines data on multiple hormones with dietary and spatial information corresponding to the year of hair growth, provides a promising tool for evaluating the responses of a broad spectrum of wildlife to changes in food availability or other environmental conditions.

AB  - Abstract Cost management has received limited attention in the aquaculture industry due to historically high profit margins. This trend, however, is not likely to continue. This creates a need for knowledge on optimally managing financial risks. In this study, we address the joint input-output price hedging problem of salmon farmers. Along with salmon, we consider three essential commodities used in fish feed mixtures. We use state-of-the-art copula models to examine multi-commodity hedging strategies. Our results show significant potential in reducing the joint price risk. Our key finding is that multi-commodity hedging improves hedging effectiveness for short horizons and risk-return trade-off for longer horizons. Salmon farmers face a trade-off where longer hedging horizons yield increased effectiveness and lower costs, yet require increased pre-planning of slaughtering volumes.

AB  - Focusing on Marine Harvest ASA, the world's largest salmon producer, this article examines the role of corporations in promoting sustainable aquaculture and regulation, exploring why a leading multinational may choose to adopt and implement a proactive sustainability strategy. It develops a neo-pluralist model for conceptualizing drivers behind proactive strategy formation, and finds that a company-specific combination of simple and mixed motives linking profit-maximization and risk calculations to a longer-term normative sustainability agenda can explain why corporations become entrepreneurs for sustainability. It concludes with some reflections on implications of the findings for understanding business in environmental governance more broadly. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Stocking of hatchery produced fish is common practise to mitigate declines in natural populations and may have unwanted genetic consequences. Here we describe a novel phenomenon arising where broodstock used for stocking may be introgressed with farmed individuals. We test how stocking affects introgression in a wild population of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by quantifying how the number of adult offspring recaptured in a stocked river depend on parental introgression. We found that hatchery conditions favour farmed genotypes such that introgressed broodstock produce up to four times the number of adult offspring compared to non-introgressed broodstock, leading to increased introgression in the recipient spawning population. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that stocking can unintentionally favour introgressed individuals and through selection for domesticated genotypes compromise the fitness of stocked wild populations.

AB  - Catfish is the largest aquaculture sector in the U.S., and there is no peer-reviewed lifecycle analysis characterizing the sector's environmental footprint. This study estimates energy and water demand per kg of catfish, based on analysis of primary data collected from businesses involved in catfish farming, hatcheries, feed mills, and processing. Further, it describes business operator perceptions of potential strategies to reduce usage. We found that direct energy inputs accounted for 49% of energy usage, while feed production, especially crop production to produce feed ingredients, comprised 39% and indirect inputs comprised 12% of usage. The largest direct energy demand came from pond aeration. Among water uses, direct water inputs, particularly for filling ponds after evaporation and harvesting, comprised the largest share (59%). Water for feed production comprised another 40%. Interviewees discussed current and potential strategies to reduce energy and water use, including automatic aerators with sensors, improved equipment, rainwater capture, and alternative harvesting practices. Shifts in crop production could also reduce catfish embodied resources. Incentives to offset costs would increase adoption. In sum, this study provides the most comprehensive exploration to date of the energy and water footprint of the largest U.S. aquaculture sector and identifies multiple opportunities that could improve the industry's resource use.

AB  - <jats:p>Phytoplankton phenology studies require a dataset that is continuous in time and space since missing data have been shown to affect the accuracy of seasonality metrics. The interpolated GlobColour product provided by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) meets these requirements by being ‘gap filled’, thus yielding the highest spatial coverage. Despite being validated on a global scale, a regional comparison to in situ Chl-a concentrations should be conducted to enable product application in optically complex waters. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the GlobColour interpolated product in British Columbia coastal waters via a statistical match-up analysis and a qualitative analysis to determine whether the data reflect the region’s large-scale seasonal trends and latitudinal dynamics. Additionally, the statistical performance of the GlobColour interpolated product was compared to the original GlobColour and Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) merged chlorophyll-a products based on in situ observations. The GlobColour interpolated product performed relatively well and was comparable to the best-performing product for each water type (RMSE = 0.28, r2 = 0.77, MdAD = 1.5, BIAS = 0.90). The statistics for all the products degraded in Case 2 waters, thus highlighting the dilemma of applying algorithms designed for Case 1 waters in Case 2 waters. Our results indicate how the quality of products can vary in different environmental conditions.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Genetic interactions (i.e. hybridization) between wild and escaped Atlantic salmon <jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic> from aquaculture operations have been widely documented, yet the ability to incorporate predictions of risk into aquaculture siting advice has been limited. Here we demonstrate a model-based approach to assessing these potential genetic interactions using a salmon aquaculture expansion scenario in southern Newfoundland as an example. We use an eco-genetic individual-based Atlantic salmon model (IBSEM) parameterized for southern Newfoundland populations, with regional environmental data and field-based estimates of survival, to explore how the proportion of escapees relative to the size of wild populations could potentially influence genetic and demographic changes in wild populations. Our simulations suggest that both demographic decline and genetic change are predicted when the percentage of escapees in a river relative to wild population size is equal to or exceeds 10% annually. The occurrence of escapees in southern Newfoundland rivers under a proposed expansion scenario was predicted using river and site locations and models of dispersal for early and late escapees. Model predictions of escapee dispersal suggest that under the proposed expansion scenario, the number of escapees is expected to increase by 49% and the highest escapee concentrations will shift westward, consistent with the location of proposed expansion (20 rivers total &gt;10% escapees, max 24%). Our results identify susceptible rivers and potential impacts predicted under the proposed aquaculture expansion scenario and illustrate how model-based predictions of both escapee dispersal and genetic impacts can be used to inform both aquaculture management decisions and wild salmon conservation.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Commercial farming of Atlantic salmon in Scotland started in 1969 and has since expanded to produce > 179,000 t year − 1 . A government department has published annual statistics and information on the seawater and freshwater sub-sectors of the Scottish salmon farming industry since 1979, and this review collates and discusses metrics covering aspects of production, farm sites and systems, fish performance, socio-economics and environmental pressures. Trends illustrated in this case study of aquaculture development include: initial increases in numbers of farms and companies, followed by decreases due to industry consolidation; increases in average farm size, and productivity of systems and employees; increases in survival, size at age and productivity of fish (yield per smolt, ova per broodstock); reduced dependence on wild stocks for ova. This case study also illustrates the importance of disease management, control of biological processes to overcome natural seasonality (i.e. production of out-of-season smolt), and the international nature of aquaculture. Improvements in fish survival, growth and productivity are attributed to progress in vaccination and health management (including fallowing), husbandry, system design, feed formulation and provision, and introduction of technology and mechanisation. Salmon farming is discussed in relation to the challenging strategy of “sustainable intensification”. Improved growth and survival over a period of increasing rearing unit size, farm size and output and decreasing relative staff input counters the common assumption that intensification compromises animal welfare. The value of capturing time series data on industry wide metrics is illustrated as it enables identification of trends, underperformance and bench-marking, as well as assessment of resource use efficiency, environmental pressures, and ultimately sustainability. Statement of relevance This review is an original collation of a comprehensive set of time series of official statistics on an entire, discrete and regionally important sector of commercial aquaculture.

AB  - Aquaculture is increasingly considered a major contributor to the growing demand for worldwide seafood production. Sustainability is becoming a key issue for aquaculture systems, with the objective to produce seafood with lower environmental impacts and that is economically viable and socially fair. In the context of the SIMTAP project, a multi-attribute model called DEXiAqua was developed. DEXiAqua uses the DEX method to assess the sustainability of aquaculture systems via indicators from technical domains and reference methods (i.e., life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, social life cycle assessment, and emergy accounting) selected and organized by the partners in the SIMTAP project. The DEX method consists of building an attribute tree that is organized to characterize a complex problem. Qualitative or quantitative indicators are measured at the end of each branch of the tree. The value of each indicator is translated into a qualitative scale for the associated attribute via threshold values. Weighted utility functions are used to build attributes from sub-attributes until the attribute of overall sustainability is reached. DEXiAqua was applied to a case study of salmon farming in France, which illustrated its ability to assess overall sustainability and help identify ways to improve the production system by identifying environmental, social, and economic hotspots. More case studies are required to apply DEXiAqua to a variety of systems with technical and contextual differences, which could result in changing attribute weights to adapt it better to different contexts.

AB  - The fermented broth of lactic acid bacteria (LFB)was the side product while lactic acid bacteria produced; however, it was abundant of antimicrobial activity. That might be a good candidate for feed additive in aquaculture. In this study, the fermented broth of Lactobacillus paracasei GL-156, the most antibacterial activity, was further evaluated the safety, growth performance gut microbiota. Common carp consumed the feed in dose of 1000 ppm LFB, the survival was no significant different with control group, but the growth performance was significant increased. In the intestine microbiota analysis, the treatment fish shown the decrease of vibrio, but no different of total bacterial count. These results demonstrate the LFB from GL-156 in enhancing the growth performance, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and promoting the growth of probiotic organisms. Compare with live probiotics currently used in aquaculture, using LFB will achieved beneficial effects equally, while providing superior tolerance to manufacturing processes, and in the lower cost.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The growth of Chilean salmon production has not been free of important sanitary and environmental shortcomings. To ensure sustainability, it is necessary to understand the environmental impacts of salmon production on the Patagonian ecosystems. Currently, there is limited regulation or monitoring of impacts in the freshwater phase compared to the marine fattening stage, and there is some evidence of local eutrophication impact and diversity changes downstream the farms. Eutrophication of Patagonian channels and fjords from marine farms has been recognized as crucial environmental risk, although most scientific evidence comes from local effects below and around farms. So far, there are no regulations based on carrying capacity estimates to limit maximum fish biomass per area or water body. There is controversy regarding the potential role of nutrients derived from farming in triggering harmful algal blooms, yet current environmental monitoring and available information does not allow establishing or rejecting a cause–effect relationship. Pesticides used to control sea lice infestation have been shown to be deleterious to some non‐target species. There is evidence that the use of high quantities of antibiotics has allowed the development of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria in sediments and there is concern that salmon aquaculture has the potential to increase the proportion of antimicrobial‐resistant bacteria to antibiotics that are used in human medicine. There is an urgent need for more comprehensive ecosystem (beyond farm) studies on the impacts of antibiotics. Escapes of salmon (exotic species) from farms are a relevant environmental risk, although the most farmed species, <jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>, has shown little success in establishing wild populations. The review identifies critical knowledge gaps whose fulfilment is essential to advance towards an ecosystem approach to aquaculture and to protect Patagonian ecosystems.</jats:p>

AB  - [Cu(NN<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]ClO<sub>4</sub> is a copper (I) complex, where NN<sub>1</sub> is an imine ligand 6-((quinolin-2-ylmethylene) amino)-2H-chromen-2-one obtained by derivatization of natural compound coumarin, developed for the treatment of infectious diseases that affect salmonids. In previous research, we showed that the Cu(I) coordination complex possesses antibacterial activity against <i>Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i>, providing protection against this pathogen in rainbow trout during challenge assays (with an RPS of 50%). In the present study, the effects of administering [Cu(NN<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]ClO<sub>4</sub> to <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i> over a 60-days period were evaluated with regard to systemic immune response and its potential to alter intestinal microbiota composition. In <i>O. mykiss</i>, an immunostimulatory effect was evident at days 30 and 45 after administration, resulting in an increment of transcript levels of IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α, lysozyme and perforin. To determine whether these immunomodulatory effects correlated with changes in the intestinal microbiota, we analyzed the metagenome diversity by V4 16S rRNA sequencing. In <i>O. mykiss</i>, both [Cu(NN<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]ClO<sub>4</sub> and commercial antibiotic florfenicol had comparable effects at the phylum level, resulting in a predominance of proteobacteria and firmicutes. Nonetheless, at the genus level, florfenicol and [Cu(NN<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]ClO<sub>4</sub> complex exhibited distinct effects on the intestinal microbiota of <i>O. mykiss</i>. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that [Cu(NN<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]ClO<sub>4</sub> is capable of stimulating the immune system at a systemic level, while inducing alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in <i>O. mykiss</i>.

AB  - <jats:p>Understanding farm-level efficiencies of resource use is critical in comparisons of the sustainability of aquaculture production systems. We developed a set of practical resource-use efficiency metrics to calculate and compare resource-use efficiency with resource-cost efficiency across major species and production systems in US aquaculture. Results showed that no one production system used all resources most efficiently. Intensive pond production of channel catfish <jats:italic>Ictalurus punctatus</jats:italic> demonstrated the greatest efficiency in the use of water, energy, labor, management, and capital resources, while RAS production was most efficient in terms of land and feed use. Among the wide array of pond scenarios examined, more intensive scenarios generally were more efficient in terms of several metrics, but economic sustainability also depends upon business models that effectively meet differing demand requirements of customers. Thus, less intensive production systems were economically sustainable in areas with relatively abundant land and water resources available at lower cost. Labor efficiencies varied widely across scenarios analyzed. Given increasing concerns related to the availability of labor for aquaculture farming in the USA, greater attention to the efficiency of labor on farms is warranted. The metrics used were aligned with common farm management tools (e.g. enterprise budgets) that allow for ease of use by farms and researchers to assess effects on comparative resource-use efficiencies of new farming practices and technologies under development.</jats:p>

AB  - ABSTRACTThis study examines the Fish Pool salmon futures contract with respect to how well the market performs in terms of the futures price being an unbiased estimator of the spot price and whether the market provides a price discovery function. Using data for 2006–2014 and with futures prices with maturities up to 6 months we find that spot and lagged futures prices are cointegrated and that the futures price provides an unbiased estimate of the spot price. We also find that, with the exception of the front month, that the causality is one-directional. The spot prices lead futures prices between 1–6 months maturity. Hence, while the spot and lagged futures prices are unbiased estimates, we do not find support for the hypothesis that futures prices provide a price discovery function. Rather, it seems that innovations in the spot price influence futures prices. This finding is not uncommon in new and immature futures contracts markets. Hence, the salmon futures market is still immature and has not yet rea...

AB  - The term ‘sustainability’ is vague and open to interpretation. In this paper we analyze how firms use the term in an effort to make the concept their own, and how it becomes a premise for further decisions, by applying a bottom-up approach focusing on the interpretation of ‘sustainability’ in the Norwegian salmon-farming industry. The study is based on a strategic selection of informants from the industry and the study design rests on: 1) identification of the main drivers of sustainability, and 2) the application of five different discursive strategies to analyze how the firms maneuver to legitimize ‘sustainability’ in their conduct. We employ the Critical Discourse Analysis framework, which emphasizes how discourses provide different concepts of meaning. The sustainability concept is assessed based on how sustainability is brought into action by social actors in a legitimate way, and how this action results in sustainable practices. The empirical case of the study is the verbal justification of sustainability practices among representatives of the Norwegian salmon-farming industry. We aim to find out how these representatives translate the rather vague directives of the sustainability concept into legitimate choices that resonate with the firms’ contextual environment, hence, how the salmon farmers perceive, explore, interpret, explain, enact, and defend the diverse landscape of sustainability when implementing professional decisions. We found a trend of passive adaptation to external requirements, such as public regulations and regulative requirements from certification bodies. At the same time, there are progressive forces that attempt to improve the sustainability of the farming practices by involvement in research and innovation projects or cooperation with other firms, e.g. the contribution from offshore engineers in developing high seas farms. The strategies outlined and discussed cannot be seen as a typology to categorize the firms. More than one discursive strategy may be involved in one firm’s choice, and the strategies may work on different levels.

AB  - The culture of red cusk eel Genypterus chilensis is currently considered a priority for Chilean aquaculture but low larval survival rates have prompted the need for the continuous use of antibacterials. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the role of live feed as a source of antibacterial-resistant bacteria in a commercial culture of G. chilensis. Samples of rotifer and Artemia cultures used as live feed were collected during the larval growth period and culturable bacterial counts were performed using a spread plate method. Rotifer and Artemia cultures exhibited high levels of resistant bacteria (8.03 × 104 to 1.79 × 107 CFU/g and 1.47 × 106 to 3.50 × 108 CFU/g, respectively). Sixty-five florfenicol-resistant isolates were identified as Vibrio (81.5%) and Pseudoalteromonas (15.4%) using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A high incidence of resistance to streptomycin (93.8%), oxytetracycline (89.2%), co-trimoxazole (84.6%), and kanamycin (73.8%) was exhibited by resistant isolates. A high proportion of isolates (76.9%) carried the florfenicol-resistance encoding genes floR and fexA, as well as plasmid DNA (75.0%). The high prevalence of multiresistant bacteria in live feed increases the incidence of the resistant microbiota in reared fish larvae, thus proper monitoring and management strategies for live feed cultures appear to be a priority for preventing future therapy failures in fish larval cultures.

AB  - This chapter describes the current knowledge about the entry routes of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance in the environment. It starts with an overview of the most important entry routes being wastewater and sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants, and natural fertilizers like pig slurry and cow manure and fertilizer from poultry farming. These sites are referred to as hotspots for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB), including bacteria pathogenic for humans and animals, also those mentioned on the WHO priority list of global priority pathogens and of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. All these entry routes, manure, wastewater, and aquacultures, are characterized in terms of general sources of antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs. We also analyze the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption report on the sale of antibacterials for veterinary. Furthermore, the EU guidelines to reduce the sales of veterinary antimicrobials across Europe under the umbrella of the EU One-Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance are mentioned. In the last section we point the need to develop and standardize the guidelines and method protocols for surveillance of AMR which need to be practicable, comparable, simple, and cost-effective so that they can be applied globally.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is a leading foodborne illness causing bacteria, and poultry is a major reservoir of this pathogen. With the recent increase in broiler production under the "no antibiotics ever" (NAE) system, this study aimed to assess the prevalence, antibiotic resistance, and virulence characteristics of C. jejuni isolated from NAE raised broilers. A total of 270 cloacal swabs were collected from the live-hang areas of 3 commercial processing plants over 9 wk. Each processing plant was visited 3 times at a 1-wk interval, and 30 samples were collected per visit. Among the total 270 cloacal swab samples, C. jejuni was isolated from 44 (16.3%) samples . Of these isolates, 65.9% possessed toxin-producing genes cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC, and invasion gene ciaB. The prevalence of antibioitc resistance genes aph (3')-IIIa, erm(B) were 59.1%, and 50%, respectively. Nine (20.45%) C. jejuni isolates were identified as multidrug resistant (MDR), and 18 (40.9%) isolates showed resistance to at least 1 tested antibiotic. The highest resistance was observed against tetracycline (29.5%), followed by nalidixic acid (25%), whereas 22.7% of isolates were resistant to 2 clinically important antibiotics, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. These results suggest that there ishigh prevalence level of multi-drug resistant C. jejuni with toxin producing virulence genes in the NAE-raised broilers sampled in this study, indicating the potential for serious human illnesses if transmitted through the food chain.

AB  - Florfenicol is used worldwide for its low side effects and strong bactericidal effect. Florfenicol is physicochemically stable and can persist in natural water bodies and affect water denitrification. Indoor aquatic microcosm models were constructed and water samples were collected at different florfenicol concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mg/L) on days 0, 7, 30, and 60 to extract the microbial genome DNA and determine the water properties. qPCR and amplicon sequencing were used to study the dynamic changes of <i>nirS</i> gene and <i>nirS</i>-type denitrifying communities structure, diversity and abundance, respectively. The results showed that higher florfenicol concentrations caused accumulation of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen in water. Florfenicol stress caused orders of magnitude changes in <i>nirS</i> gene abundance, showing a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. 100 mg/L florfenicol addition led to a sustained increase of <i>nirS</i> gene abundance in water bodies. The florfenicol addition altered denitrifying community structure and suppressed the richness and diversity index of denitrifying bacteria in water body. Over time, the richness and diversity index gradually recovered. <i>Proteobacteria</i> was always the dominant denitrifying phylum in water. The relative abundance of <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>beta proteobacterium</i> showed obvious positive correlation with <i>nirS</i> gene abundance and were the dominant genera under florfenicol stress. Our study provided a scientific basis for the rational use of florfenicol in aquaculture to maintain a healthy and stable microecological environment, and also provided a preliminary understanding of the response characteristics of water denitrifying microorganisms to florfenicol exposure.

AB  - There is now little doubt that the world’s fisheries are in crisis. Mounting scientific evidence points to dramatic declines in global catches. Increasingly, many are making the case that farming fish offers a solution to meeting the growing demand for seafood that catching fish cannot provide. Aquaculture now accounts for roughly one-third of the world’s total supply of food fish and undoubtedly the contribution of aquaculture to seafood supplies will increase in the future. Aquaculture has the potential to become a sustainable practice that can supplement capture fisheries and significantly contribute to feeding the world’s growing population. However, instead of helping to ease the crisis in wild fisheries, unsustainable aquaculture development could exacerbate the problems and create new ones, damaging our important and already-stressed coastal areas. The vast majority of aquaculture takes place in Asia. In 2002, over 70% of worldwide aquaculture production was in China alone. Most farmed fish and shellfish are grown in traditional small-scale systems that benefit local communities and minimize the environmental impact. Utilizing simple culture technologies and minimal inputs, these systems have been used for centuries. The net contribution of these traditional aquaculture systems can be great as they offer many benefits, including food security in developing nations. However, as happened with the “green revolution” of agriculture in the last century, the current “blue revolution” of aquaculture is becoming an industrial mode of food production. An emerging trend is toward the increased development of farming high-value carnivorous fish species using environmentally and socially damaging systems. Farming fish on an industrial scale, especially carnivorous fish is rapidly expanding; the number of different species farmed and geographic regions where they are farmed increases continually. Largely controlled by multinational corporations, industrialized farming of carnivorous fish such as salmon requires the intensive use of resources and exports problems to the surrounding environment, often resulting in environmental impacts and social conflicts. Some segments of the aquaculture industry are long overdue for reform. What is required is a paradigm shift in how we think about aquaculture, particularly its interaction with natural and social systems. This new paradigm should be based on sustainable development — “the management and conservation of the natural resource base, and the orientation of technological and institutional change in such a manner to ensure the attainment and continued satisfaction of human needs for present and future generations. Such development conserves land, water, plant and genetic resources, is environmentally non-degrading, technologically appropriate, economically viable and socially acceptable.” Sustainable aquaculture must consider the ecological, social, and economic aspects of development.

AB  - Anthropogenic pollution has a huge impact on the water quality of marine ecosystems. Heavy metals and antibiotics are anthropogenic stressors that have a major effect on the health of the marine organisms. Although heavy metals are also associate with volcanic eruptions, wind erosion or evaporation, most of them come from industrial and urban waste. Such contamination, coupled to the use and subsequent misuse of antimicrobials in aquatic environments, is an important stress factor capable of affecting the marine communities in the ecosystem. Bivalves are important ecological components of the oceanic environments and can bioaccumulate pollutants during their feeding through water filtration, acting as environmental sentinels. However, heavy metals and antibiotics pollution can affect several of their physiologic and immunological processes, including their microbiome. In fact, heavy metals and antibiotics have the potential to select resistance genes in bacteria, including those that are part of the microbiota of bivalves, such as <i>Vibrio</i> spp. Worryingly, antibiotic-resistant phenotypes have been shown to be more tolerant to heavy metals, and <i>vice versa</i>, which probably occurs through co- and cross-resistance pathways. In this regard, a crucial role of heavy metal resistance genes in the spread of mobile element-mediated antibiotic resistance has been suggested. Thus, it might be expected that antibiotic resistance of <i>Vibrio</i> spp. associated with bivalves would be higher in contaminated environments. In this review, we focused on co-occurrence of heavy metal and antibiotic resistance in <i>Vibrio</i> spp. In addition, we explore the Chilean situation with respect to the contaminants described above, focusing on the main bivalves-producing region for human consumption, considering bivalves as potential vehicles of antibiotic resistance genes to humans through the ingestion of contaminated seafood.

AB  - Adaptations at the gamete level (a) evolve quickly, (b) appear sensitive to inbreeding and outbreeding and (c) have important influences on potential to reproduce. We apply this understanding to problems posed by escaped farm salmon and measure their potential to reproduce in the wild. Farm Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are a threat to biodiversity, because they escape in large numbers and can introgress, dilute or disrupt locally adapted wild gene pools. Experiments at the whole fish level have found farm reproductive potential to be significant, but inferior compared to wild adults, especially for males. Here, we assess reproductive performance at the gamete level through detailed in vitro comparisons of the form, function, fertility, compatibility and competitiveness of farm versus wild Atlantic salmon sperm and eggs, in conditions mimicking the natural gametic microenvironment, using fish raised under similar environmental conditions. Despite selective domestication and reduced genetic diversity, we find functional equivalence in all farm fish gamete traits compared with their wild ancestral strain. Our results identify a clear threat of farm salmon reproduction with wild fish and therefore encourage further consideration of using triploid farm strains with optimized traits for aquaculture and fish welfare, as triploid fish remain reproductively sterile following escape.

AB  - Abstract It is well understood that measurements of ecological footprint and many other ecological indicators are associated with varying degrees of uncertainty, yet imprecision in ecological footprint results is rarely assessed or communicated. We calculated the marine portion of the ecological footprint of products derived from five reduction fisheries: Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Monte Carlo analysis was used to measure the imprecision in marine footprint measurements resulting from multiple sources of uncertainty and natural variability in input parameters, and to determine the degree to which imprecision affects our ability to draw meaningful conclusions when comparing products sourced from different fisheries on the basis of ecological footprint. Gulf menhaden and Antarctic krill were found to have the smallest marine footprints, while blue whiting was found to have the largest. Results show that there is much uncertainty associated with marine footprint calculations and that the most significant drivers of this imprecision are uncertainty and natural variability regarding measurements of trophic level and trophic interactions. Marine footprint is highly correlated with trophic level, and clear differences can be seen when comparing species of very different trophic levels. However, comparisons of products derived from species’ with similar trophic levels are less likely to provide conclusive results. The choice of mass, protein or energy content as the basis of comparison was also considered and was found to influence the results, particularly when comparing species with similar trophic levels. While it is likely that imprecision of marine footprint measurements of fishery-derived products will remain high, technological improvements and a better understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics may make future studies more precise.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Salmonids are the third major farmed finfish species after carps and tilapines, and thus contribute to global food fish production. However, as the aquaculture industry continues to grow, several challenges have emerged. Left unchecked, current problems will hinder aquaculture development. Metabolomics is one of the powerful biotechnological tools that will contribute to solving some of the pressing problems. This review aims to summarise findings and identify gaps from studies that used metabolomics in farmed salmon research. We extracted methodological information for comparison, highlighted analytical platform usages and identified most studied salmonids and sample types. We reviewed key articles to highlight the latest research themes. From the identified research gaps, future perspectives regarding potential use of metabolomics to solve issues in ecotoxicology, thermotolerance, nutrition, post‐harvest quality, health and disease, and husbandry practices are provided. The survey also highlighted improvements in execution of metabolomics protocols in aquaculture.</jats:p>

AB  - Macroparasites, such as ticks, lice, and helminths, are a concern in livestock and aquaculture production, and can be controlled by genetic improvement of the host population. Genetic improvement should aim at reducing the rate at which parasites spread across the farmed population. This rate is determined by the basic reproduction ratio, i.e. $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 , which is the appropriate breeding goal trait. This study aims at providing a method to derive the economic value of $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 . Costs of a disease are the sum of production losses and expenditures on disease control. Genetic improvement of $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 lowers the loss-expenditure frontier. Its economic effect depends on whether the management strategy is optimized or not. The economic value may be derived either from the reduction in losses with constant expenditures or from the reduction in expenditures with constant losses. When $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
  ≤ 1, the economic value of a further reduction is zero because there is no risk of a major epidemic. When $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
  > 1 and management is optimized, the economic value increases with decreasing values of $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 , because both the mean number of parasites per host and frequency of treatments decrease at an increasing rate when $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 decreases. When $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
  > 1 and management is not optimized, the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reducing expenditures or losses. For sea lice in salmon, the economic value depends on a reduction in expenditures with constant losses, and is estimated to be 0.065€/unit $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 /kg production. Response to selection for measures of disease prevalence cannot be predicted from quantitative genetic theory alone. Moreover, many studies fail to address the issue of whether genetic improvement results in reduced losses or expenditures. Using $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 as the breeding goal trait, weighed by its appropriate economic value, avoids these issues. When management is optimized, the economic value increases with decreasing values of $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 (until the threshold of $${\text{R}}_{0} = 1$$
 , where it drops to zero). When management is not optimized, the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reduced expenditures or production losses. For sea lice in salmon, the economic value is estimated to be 0.065 €/unit $${\text{R}}_{0}$$
 /kg production.

AB  - The generation of polluted and/or toxic effluents from pharmaceutical companies has emerged as one of today's most pressing environmental challenges. Traditional wastewater treatment methods which have been employed to address such challenges over the years have numerous significant drawbacks. Adsorption is gaining popularity in the scientific community due to its high performance, low cost, ease of handling, and diverse range of adsorbents. This review paper focuses on the application of green, environmentally friendly, cheap or readily available biodegradable biopolymer composite adsorbents as a developed technique in an attempt to completely degrade toxic recalcitrant organic compounds from various environmental matrices. This paper will discuss traditional methods, advanced methods, combination techniques including benefits and drawbacks, as well as by products or any side effects that limit their use.

AB  - <jats:p>A nutritional bottleneck in salmonid aquaculture is the procurement of marine‐derived compounds, such as essential amino and fatty acids, including omega‐3 fatty acids, lysine, and methionine. Therefore, insects containing these compounds are highly promising as feed ingredients. The present study evaluates larvae of a “marine” insect (<jats:italic>Coelopa frigida</jats:italic>, the bristly‐legged seaweed fly larvae, SWFL) reared on brown algae side streams as a feed ingredient for rainbow trout (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</jats:italic>). SWFL contained, on a dry matter basis, 60% crude protein (CP), 3.5% lysine, and 1.5% methionine, as well as 17% lipids, including 4% eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Four isoenergetic (<jats:italic>ca</jats:italic>. 23 MJ kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> gross energy) and isoproteic (<jats:italic>ca</jats:italic>. 45% CP) feeds were evaluated in a 10‐week feeding trial. The diets included a control containing 25% fish meal, a commercial reference, and two diets substituting 40% fish meal with either SWFL or partially defatted black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) meal (<jats:italic>Hermetia illucens</jats:italic>). SWFL‐fed fish displayed higher specific growth rates (SGR) compared to BSFL‐fed fish and similar SGR compared to control and reference diet‐fed fish. Feed intake in SWFL‐fed fish was higher than for the control and BSFL diets and similar to the reference diet. The feed conversion ratio of fish fed the BSFL and SWFL diets was higher compared to the control, suggesting lower bioavailability of both insect meals compared to fish meals. No difference in intestinal health parameters was noted between the insect diets and the control diet, indicating good intestinal health across all treatments. However, changes in electrogenic intestinal transport were observed between the SWFL and BSFL diets, illustrating the heterogeneous effect of different insect products. Overall, SWFL meal is a promising alternative marine feed ingredient, compatible with circular production systems, as it can be efficiently cultivated using marine side streams.</jats:p>

AB  - Carbonaceous adsorbents (CAs) are becoming increasingly popular owing to their low-cost, ease of preparation, and versatility. Meanwhile, aquaculture is becoming a fundamental food industry, globally, due to a wide range of advantages such as economic and nutritional benefits, whilst protecting the depletion of natural resources. However, as with any farming, the technique is known to introduce a plethora of chemicals into the surrounding environment, including antibiotics, nutrients, fertilisers and more. Therefore, the treatment of aquaculture effluent is gaining traction to ensure the sustainable growth of the industry. Although the existing mitigation techniques are somewhat effective, they suffer from degradation of the water quality or harm to local environments/organisms. This article aims to identify the sources and impacts of various aquaculture pollutants. After which the authors will provide an environmentally friendly and novel approach to the treatment of aquaculture effluent using carbonaceous adsorbents. The article will detail discussions about the product life span, including, synthesis, activation, modification, applications in aqueous media, regeneration and End-of-Life (EoL) approaches, with a particular focus on the impacts of competitive adsorption between pollutants and environmental matrices. Some research gaps were also highlighted, such as the lack of literature applying real-world samples, the effects of competitive adsorption and the EoL applications and management for CAs.

AB  - Strategic environmental assessments (SEAs) are used in coastal zone planning in Norway to assess how changed area-use can impact a variety of uses and interests and make recommendations for trade-off decisions between them. The transparency and consistency of the SEAs are important for their throughput legitimacy. This paper analyses how the set up and practices of SEA processes affect their transparency and consistency, how they can be improved, and what trade-offs there may be between the two. This is based on cases studies of SEAs in two intermunicipal planning processes involving 143 proposed aquaculture areas in 18 municipalities in Northern Norway. Marine aquaculture in the form of salmon farming has grown into a major industry on the Norwegian coast, and there are ambitions for further growth. Salmon farming is a major driver for coastal zone planning in Norway as many municipalities hope it will provide jobs and income and fish farms must be placed in accordance with municipal coastal zone plans. The paper specifically analyses how proposed aquaculture areas were handled in the SEAs, including their knowledge base, assessment methods used and actual trade-offs, and how this impact transparency and consistency. Consistency is considered both across geographies and SEA processes and through the individual SEA processes.

AB  - Conservation management of wild fish may include fish health management in sympatric populations of domesticated fish in aquaculture. We developed a mathematical model for the population dynamics of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) on domesticated populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Broughton Archipelago region of British Columbia. The model was fit to a seven-year dataset of monthly sea louse counts on farms in the area to estimate population growth rates in relation to abiotic factors (temperature and salinity), local host density (measured as cohort surface area), and the use of a parasiticide, emamectin benzoate, on farms. We then used the model to evaluate management scenarios in relation to policy guidelines that seek to keep motile louse abundance below an average three per farmed salmon during the March–June juvenile wild Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) migration. Abiotic factors mediated the duration of effectiveness of parasiticide treatments, and results suggest treatment of farmed salmon conducted in January or early February minimized average louse abundance per farmed salmon during the juvenile wild salmon migration. Adapting the management of parasites on farmed salmon according to migrations of wild salmon may therefore provide a precautionary approach to conserving wild salmon populations in salmon farming regions.

AB  - <jats:p>Snakeskin gourami (Trichogaster pectoralis) is a freshwater fish species that is being increasingly cultivated in Southeast Asia. The expansion of farms and intensive farming practices has led to the unexplained mortality of snakeskin gourami and tremendous economic losses in many farms. We investigated the unusual mortality of snakeskin gourami at 22 farms in Central Thailand. The moribund fish showed darkened skin, erratic swimming, exophthalmos, and haemorrhaging around the eyeballs, with cumulative mortality between 20% and 45%. Our necropsy findings revealed an enlarged liver and anterior kidney, splenomegaly, haemorrhage in most internal organs, pericarditis, and brain congestion. Histopathology revealed haemorrhaging and congestion of the blood vessels in the liver with infiltration of lymphocytes, enlarged blood vessels with mononuclear and lymphocyte infiltration in the meninges, and cerebral parenchyma were observed. Severe necrotising and suppurative pericarditis with myocardial infarction were found. Epidemiological studies and laboratory diagnosis revealed that Streptococcus agalactiae was predominantly isolated from the moribund fish. Laboratory investigations of the representative 33 isolates of S. agalactiae using mass spectrometry, multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay, pulse-gel electrophoresis, and serotyping suggested that all the isolates were S. agalactiae serotype VII, which is different from the serotype III isolated from diseased tilapia in Thailand. An experimental challenge using three representative isolates of S. agalactiae on snakeskin gourami caused clinical signs, gross lesions, and pathological changes, with high mortality exceeding 60%, which is similar to the mortality in most natural infections. Moreover, S. agalactiae was recovered from the spleen, kidneys, and liver of all the challenged fish. Taken together, this study provides important information that S. agalactiae serotype VII is virulent in snakeskin gourami and can potentially spread among these fish in fish farms. Appropriate preventive measures and the control of animal movements should thus be implemented.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Cleaner fish used as a biological control agent against salmon lice is rapidly increasing in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. However, concerns have been raised about the welfare and mortality of cleaner fish in salmon cage systems, which could in turn affect their performance in controlling salmon lice. In a 4-month autumn-winter study, we monitored growth, welfare, mortality and daytime depth distribution of the most commonly used cleaner fish, farmed ballan wrasse and lumpfish, in six salmon production sea cages where thermo- and haloclines were present. Ballan wrasse did not grow (SGR: small: −0.01% day−1, large: −0.06% day−1), while lumpfish significantly doubled in size (SGR: 0.87% day−1) during the study. High losses (registered mortality + unregistered loss) were observed in both species (57 and 27% of ballan wrasse and lumpfish, respectively). The welfare status of remaining individuals generally improved over the study period, regardless of species. Brief daytime camera observations at hides found ballan wrasse were typically deeper at warmer (median 12.4 °C) more saline (median 31.7 ppt) depths, where salmon were expected to reside during day periods, compared to lumpfish generally occupying colder (median 7.3 °C), brackish (median 18.9 ppt) water in surface layers. Considerable mortalities, minimal feeding (inferred from ceased growth) by ballan wrasse and a possible mismatch in lumpfish and salmon depths (inferred from limited daytime camera observations) suggest that cleaner fish may have low long-term effectiveness against salmon lice in stratified salmon sea cages over autumn-winter. Similar studies across seasons, locations and cage types (e.g. depth-based cage technologies) are vital to understand the extent of these issues in salmon aquaculture more broadly.

AB  - Theory predicts that hybrid fitness should decrease as population divergence increases. This suggests that the effects of human-induced hybridization might be adequately predicted from the known divergence among parental populations. We tested this prediction by quantifying trait differentiation between multigenerational crosses of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and divergent wild populations from the Northwest Atlantic; the former escape repeatedly into the wild, while the latter are severely depleted. Under common environmental conditions and at the spatiotemporal scale considered (340 km, 12 000 years of divergence), substantial cross differentiation had a largely additive genetic basis at behavioral, life history, and morphological traits. Wild backcrossing did not completely restore hybrid trait distributions to presumably more optimal wild states. Consistent with theory, the degree to which hybrids deviated in absolute terms from their parental populations increased with increasing parental di...

AB  - Fish as the primary source for the essential n − 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) cannot cover the global demand for these important nutrients resulting in a supply gap of currently 1.1 million tons of EPA + DHA annually. A further exploitation of natural fish stocks is linked to great damage to ecosystems. Oleaginous microalgae are a natural source for EPA and DHA and could possibly contribute to closing this gap. The cultivation in photobioreactors (PBR) in a ‘cold-weather’ climate showed that microalgae compare favorably to aquaculture fish. The present study assesses the economic potential of microalgae for food in such system model. Techno-economic assessment was conducted on the basis of a dynamic system model for the cultivation of Nannochloropsis sp. in industrial scale in Central Germany over a time span of 30 years. The net present value (NPV) and return-on-investment (ROI) were obtained for a number of scenarios in which technic and economic parameters were altered. Taking the size of the PBR considered into account, the cultivation of Nannochloropsis sp. yielded a positive NPV of EUR 4.5 million after 30 years which translates to an annualized ROI of 1.87%. The sensitivity analysis overall resulted in annualized ROIs between 1.12 and 2.47%. Major expenditures comprised the PBR infrastructure, maintenance and labor cost. An extended cultivation season by four weeks was responsible for an NPV surplus of almost one third (32%). An increase in the selling price by 15% was responsible for a 47% higher NPV. In comparison with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) raised in aquaculture, EPA from Nannochloropsis sp. resulted in about halved cultivation costs (− 44 to − 60%). In this study we could show that microalgae from photoautotrophic cultivation not only have the potential to supply humans with essential nutrients, but they are also a lucrative investment, even in a ‘cold-weather’ climate where cultivation cannot take place year round.

AB  - During the production of salmonids in aquaculture, it is common to observe growth-stunted individuals. The cause for the so-called "loser fish syndrome" is unclear, which needs further investigation. Here, we present and compare computer vision systems for the automatic detection and classification of loser fish in Atlantic salmon images taken in sea cages. We evaluated two end-to-end approaches (combined detection and classification) based on YoloV5 and YoloV7, and a two-stage approach based on transfer learning for detection and an ensemble of classifiers (e.g., linear perception, Adaline, C-support vector, K-nearest neighbours, and multi-layer perceptron) for classification. To our knowledge, the use of an ensemble of classifiers, considering consolidated classifiers proposed in the literature, has not been applied to this problem before. Classification entailed the assigning of every fish to a healthy and a loser class. The results of the automatic classification were compared to the reliability of human classification. The best-performing computer vision approach was based on YoloV7, which reached a precision score of 86.30 %, a recall score of 71.75 %, and an F1 score of 78.35 %. YoloV5 presented a precision of 79.7 %, while the two-stage approach reached a precision of 66.05 %. Human classification had a substantial agreement strength (Fleiss' Kappa score of 0.68), highlighting that evaluation by a human is subjective. Our proposed automatic detection and classification system will enable farmers and researchers to follow the abundance of losers throughout the production period. We provide our dataset of annotated salmon images for further research.

AB  - Genetic interaction between domesticated escapees and wild conspecifics represents a persistent challenge to an environmentally sustainable Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry. We used a recently developed eco-genetic model (IBSEM) to investigate potential changes in a wild salmon population subject to spawning intrusion from domesticated escapees. At low intrusion levels (5%-10% escapees), phenotypic and demographic characteristics of the recipient wild population only displayed weak changes over 50 years and only at high intrusion levels (30%-50% escapees) were clear changes visible in this period. Our modeling also revealed that genetic changes in phenotypic and demographic characteristics were greater in situations where strayers originating from a neighboring wild population were domestication-admixed and changed in parallel with the focal wild population, as opposed to nonadmixed. While recovery in the phenotypic and demographic characteristics was observed in many instances after domesticated salmon intrusion was halted, in the most extreme intrusion scenario, the population went extinct. Based upon results from these simulations, together with existing knowledge, we suggest that a combination of reduced spawning success of domesticated escapees, natural selection purging maladapted phenotypes/genotypes from the wild population, and phenotypic plasticity, buffer the rate and magnitude of change in phenotypic and demographic characteristics of wild populations subject to spawning intrusion of domesticated escapees. The results of our simulations also suggest that under specific conditions, natural straying among wild populations may buffer genetic changes in phenotypic and demographic characteristics resulting from introgression of domesticated escapees and that variation in straying in time and space may contribute to observed differences in domestication-driven introgression among native populations.

               <jats:p>India remains as a top supplier of value-added seafoods to the global markets. Cochin is one of the leading fishing ports in India contributing to country’s major seafood export. As part of risk assessment, we analyzed the prevalence of multi-drug resistant <jats:italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</jats:italic>; seafood borne gastroenteritis-causing pathogen, in shellfishes collected from major fish markets in Cochin. This bacterial species was initially isolated on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar and HiCrome™ Vibrio agar, further confirmed by detection of <jats:italic>V. parahaemolyticus</jats:italic> species-specific <jats:italic>toxR</jats:italic> gene and by 16S r RNA sequencing. A total of 113 confirmed <jats:italic>V. parahaemolyticus</jats:italic> were recovered. Almost all the strains exhibited resistance towards three or more antibiotics (multiple-drug resistant) and harbored virulence related exoenzymes especially hemolysin (Kanagawa phenomenon); which is indeed a matter of concern. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of the isolates ranged from 0.21 to 0.57. Furthermore, our results also indicate a substantial increase in the incidence of the pathogen in seafood from the area compared to previous years. This may pose a risk to the local and international consumers of the seafood. Practicing complete hygiene and adequate cooking is strongly recommended. Regular monitoring of aquaculture areas and fish markets is urged to reduce dissemination of pathogenic <jats:italic>V. parahaemolyticus</jats:italic> in seafood and to prevent fatal cases of human infection induced by this species in the country.</jats:p>

AB  - Piscirickettsiosis, the main infectious disease affecting salmon farming in Chile, still has no efficient control measures. <i>Piscirickettsia salmonis</i> is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can survive and replicate within the host macrophages, evading the immune response. Triterpenic saponins obtained from the <i>Quillaja saponaria</i> tree have been widely studied, and have been shown to be immunomodulatory agents, suitable for feed and vaccine applications for veterinary and human uses. The impact of the oral administration of two extracts of Quillaja saponins on the infection of <i>P. salmonis</i> in <i>Salmo salar</i> and the corresponding gene expressions of immunomarkers were studied under three in vivo models. In the intraperitoneal challenge model, the group fed with Quillaja extracts showed lower mortality (29.1% treated vs. 37.5% control). Similar results were obtained in the cohabitation model trial (36.3% vs. 60.0%). In the commercial pilot trial, the results showed a significant reduction of 71.3% in mortality caused by <i>P. salmonis</i> (0.51% vs. 1.78%) and antibiotic use (reduction of 66.6% compared to untreated control). Also, Quillaja extracts significantly modulated the expression of IFN-II and CD8. These results represent evidence supporting the future use of purified Quillaja extracts as a natural non-pharmacological strategy for the prevention and control of <i>P. salmonis</i> infections in salmon.

AB  - The Chilean Patagonia is a complex puzzle of numerous fjords, channels, bays, estuaries, and islands. The largest part of it is very remote, hampering the generation of scientific knowledge and effective management planning that could balance conservation of the marine resources with the increasing development of aquaculture activities. The present study focuses on the deep-water emergent cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus, dwelling in Chilean Patagonia, with the aim to illustrate its population genetic structure, demography and adaptation of the species along this coast. Microsatellite loci analysis included D. dianthus individuals from twelve sampling localities along bathymetric and oceanographic gradients from the latitude 40°S to 48°S. The results showed a lack of genetic structure with an asymmetric dispersion of individuals, and relevant heterozygosity deficiency in some populations. This study also analyses the natural and human impacts affecting the region (e.g., climate change, increasing salmon farming activities), and stresses the importance of including genetic information in the process of management and conservation of marine resources. In particular, the relevance of using interdisciplinary approaches to fill the gaps in scientific knowledge especially in remote and pristine areas of western Patagonia. Therefore, information on genetic spatial distribution of marine fauna could become pivotal to develop a holistic ecosystem-based approach for marine spatial planning.

               <jats:p>Aquaculture now produces more seafood than wild capture fisheries and this production is expected to at least double by 2050. Representing almost half of global production, marine aquaculture will contribute to sustainably feeding the growing humanity. However, climate change will undoubtedly challenge the future growth of marine aquaculture. Temperature and sea-level rise, shifts in precipitation, freshening from glacier melt, changing ocean productivity, and circulation patterns, increasing occurrence of extreme climatic events, eutrophication, and ocean acidification are all stressors that will influence marine aquaculture. The objective of this themed article set was to bring together contributions on the broad theme of the potential impacts, adaptation, and mitigation strategies of marine aquaculture to climate change. Here we present 14 papers covering a diverse set of approaches including experimentation, modelling, meta-analysis and review, and disciplines like biology, ecology, economics, and engineering. These articles focus on the impacts of climate change-related stressors on the aquaculture potential itself and on the resulting ecological interactions (e.g. parasitism and predation), on phenotypic plasticity and adaptation potential of species, and on measures to mitigate the effects of climate change on aquaculture and vice versa. Considering this, adaptation of the aquaculture sector relies on anticipating the biogeographical changes in the distribution of species, determining their potential for adaptation and selective breeding for resistance or tolerance to climate-induced stressors, and fostering ecosystem resilience by means of conservation, restoration, or remediation. By will or by force, aquaculture will contribute to the low carbon economy of tomorrow. Aquaculture must move towards a new paradigm where the carbon footprint and the analysis of the life cycle of products are at least as important as economic profitability.</jats:p>

AB  - Norway produces more than one million tonnes of salmonids every year, almost exclusively in open-water net pens. In 2014, the Norwegian government announced plans to increase salmonid production. However, increasing the number of farmed salmonids can have negative effects on the marine environment that threaten the industry's sustainability. In particular, production growth can lead to an increase in density-dependent diseases, including parasitic sea lice. The aim of this study was to simulate the effects of increased salmonid production on sea lice abundance using different scenarios for increasing the number of fish and for the management of sea lice. We used a previously developed, partly stage-structured model based on Norwegian production and environmental data to simulate the different scenarios. Our results show that increasing the marine farmed salmonid population at a national level by two or five times the current production leads to an increase in the sea lice abundance by 3.5% and 7.1%, respectively. We also found that by lowering the maximum allowable level of sea lice to an average of 0.049 adult females per fish, weekly treatments can be used to control sea lice population growth with a five times increase in production. However, this increases the number of farms treating per week by as much as 281.3%, which can lead to high costs and increased mortality among farmed salmonids. Overall, the results from our study shed light on the effects of increasing salmonid production in Norway with respect to the ongoing threat of sea lice infestations.

AB  - Piscirickettsiosis is the most severe, persistent, and damaging disease that has affected the Chilean salmon industry since its origins in the 1980s. As a preventive strategy for this disease, different vaccines have been developed and used over the last 30 years. However, vaccinated salmon and trout frequently die in the sea cages and the use of antibiotics is still high demonstrating the low efficiency of the available vaccines. The reasons why the vaccines fail so often are still debated, but it could involve different extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Among the extrinsic factors, mainly associated with chronic stress, we can distinguish: 1) biotic including coinfection with sea lice, sealions attacks or harmful algal blooms; 2) abiotic including low oxygen or high temperature; and 3) farm-management factors including overcrowding or chemical delousing treatments. Among the intrinsic factors, we can distinguish: 1) fish-related factors including host's genetic variability (species, population and individual), sex or age; 2) pathogen-related factors including their variability and ability to evade host immune responses; and 3) vaccine-related factors including low immunogenicity and poor matches with the circulating pathogen strain. Based on the available evidence, in order to improve the development and the efficacy of vaccines against <i>P. salmonis</i> we recommend: a) Do not perform efficacy evaluations by intraperitoneal injection of pathogens because they generate an artificial protective immune response, instead cohabitation or immersion challenges must be used; b) Evaluate the diversity of pathogen strains in the field and ensure a good antigenic match with the vaccines; c) Investigate whether host genetic diversity could be improved, e.g. through selection, in favor of better and longer responses to vaccination; d) To reduce the stressful effects at the cage level, controlling the co-infection of pathogens and avoiding fish overcrowding. To date, we do not know the immunological mechanisms by which the vaccines against <i>P. salmonis</i> may or may not generate protection. More studies are required to identify what type of response, cellular or molecular, is required to develop effective vaccines.

AB  - Cultured and wild Atlantic salmon around the world are affected by sea lice. Salmon culturing countries have policies in place to minimize sea lice abundance on cultured salmon in open net pens in the marine environment. To adhere to these policies, salmon producers deploy a range of management measures against sea lice throughout the production cycle. The cost effectiveness of these sea lice management measures is not well quantified. This study provides estimates for cost effectiveness in Scotland of (1) individual sea lice management measures and (2) integrated management strategies that span an entire production cycle. Estimates were based on the cost-effectiveness ratio, in which costs consist of those associated with equipment, implementation, environment and side effects (mortality). Effectiveness was based on interviews and expert opinions. For single measures, skirts and the use of in-feed medicines had the best cost-effectiveness. Cleaner fish, fresh or brackish water baths, the physical removal measures (thermolicer and hydrolicer) and medicinal baths were among the next most cost-effective measures, followed by hydrogen peroxide baths. Tarpaulins were more cost-effective than well boats due to lower costs under the assumption of equal effectiveness. Direct comparison of cost effectiveness among measures may not always be constructive as they are deployed at different times in the production cycle and their functionality is different. A holistic approach to sea lice management, a common practice in industry as shown by the integrated management strategies, may reduce risk of developing resistance. For the single measures, carbon costs were insignificant compared to other costs. If measures would have a lasting effect on production through to harvest, such as ongoing increased mortality as a result of a management measure, carbon costs may become significant. Better quantification of effectiveness is important because the scarcity of data led to uncertainty that had a large impact on cost-effectiveness estimates. Generally, this study demonstrated a lack of reliable publicly available data and lack of standardization of data, which constrains research. Highlighted gaps in knowledge can serve as a guide to improve further understanding.

AB  - The fast rise of aquaculture practices during the last decades has increased the need of adopting culture strategies to optimize production and guarantee the sustainability of the sector. This study aimed to provide a management tool to help mussel farmers identify optimal culture strategies and use production inputs efficiently. For this purpose, we evaluated the productivity and efficiency of different stocking densities and culture durations by the joint application of parametric and nonparametric frontier analysis at the farm scale. The translog production function outperformed the Cobb–Douglas model currently applied in most farm-scale frontier analyses. This model estimates that the optimal culture density is ca. 700 ind m−1, given that at lower densities, efficiency decreases (under-usage of available space) and mussel quality did not improve, and at higher densities, mortality and dislodgements from the ropes led to economic losses. This work also showed that marginal analysis does not provide an accurate estimation of the economic efficiency when unitary costs and prices are not constant. According to the Malmquist indices, mussel farmers should shorten the culture period to improve their productivity. All these results support the joint use of parametric and nonparametric frontier analysis as management tool for optimizing input use and scheduling aquaculture production.

AB  - The environmental impacts of biomass harvesting can be quantified through the amount of net primary production required to produce one unit of harvested biomass (SPPR-specific primary production required). This paper presents a new calculation framework that explicitly takes into account full food web complexity and shows that the resulting SPPR for toothed whales in the Icelandic marine ecosystem is 2.8 times higher than the existing approach based on food web simplification. In addition, we show that our new framework can be coupled to food web modeling to examine how uncertainty on ecological data and processes can be accounted for while estimating SPPR. This approach reveals that an increase in the degree of heterotrophy by flagellates from 0% to 100% results in a two-fold increase in SPPR estimates in the Barents Sea. It also shows that the estimated SPPR is between 3.9 (herring) and 5.0 (capelin) times higher than that estimated when adopting food chain theory. SPPR resulting from our new approach is only valid for the given time period for which the food web is modeled and cannot be used to infer changes in SPPR when the food web is altered by changes in human exploitation or environmental changes.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>With ever-expanding marine aquaculture, calls for sustainable development become louder. The concept of aquaculture carrying capacity (CC) emerged 30 years ago to frame development, though so far, most studies have focused on the production and ecological components, leaving aside the social perspective. Often, estimations are carried out a posteriori, once aquaculture is already in place, hence ignoring relevant voices potentially opposing the onset of aquaculture implementation. We argue that CC should be multidimensional, iterative, inclusive, and just. Hence, the evaluative scope of CC needs to be broadened by moving from industry-driven, Western-based approaches towards an inclusive vision taking into consideration historical, cultural, and socio-economic concerns of all stakeholders of a given area. To this end, we suggest guidelines to frame a safe operating space for aquaculture based on a multi-criteria, multi-stakeholder approach, while embracing the social-ecological dynamics of aquaculture settings by applying an adaptive approach and acknowledging the critical role of place-based constraints. Rather than producing a box-checking exercise, CC approaches should proactively engage with aquaculture-produced outcomes at multiple scales, embracing complexity, and uncertainty. Scoping CC with the voices of all relevant societal groups, ideally before aquaculture implementation, provides the unique opportunity to jointly develop truly sustainable aquaculture.</jats:p>

AB  - Gill is a key respiratory and excretory organ in fish as it provides oxygen need for survival and excretes waste products. However, gills can be infected with pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria leading to increasing fish morbidity and mortality. This study was carried out to isolate, estimate and identify bacteria on the gills of Clarias gariepinus reared in different holding facilities. The susceptibility patterns of the bacteria were also studied using 10 antibiotics commonly used in pisciculture in Nigeria. A total of 84 bacteria belonging to 12 genera were isolated from the gills of 75 Clarias gariepinus. Gram-negative bacteria isolated included Salmonella species (3.6%), Pseudomonas species (7.1%), Aeromonas species (2.4%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Proteus species (11.9%) Klebsiella species (3.6%), Citrobacter species (4.8%), and Shigella species (3.6%). Gram-positive Corynebacterium species (3.6 %), Staphylococcus species (20.3%), Bacillus species (19.0%) and Streptococcus species (7.1%) were also isolated. The result showed varying bacteria species when considering the different holding facilities. Greater than 50 % of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated were resistant to 5 and 6 different antibiotics respectively while greater than 80 % of all the bacteria were resistant to ≥ 3 antibiotics. The presence of these bacteria in fish predict subsequent impediment in pisciculture and may lead to socioeconomic losses, environmental contaminations and high public health risk. This study calls for concern and an urgent intervention on antibiotic stewardship among fish farmers.

AB  - Three groups of Atlantic salmon were kept at a constant temperature of 4, 10 and 14 °C. The adipose fins were removed; six fish/group were sampled at 11 subsequent time points post-clipping. Samples were prepared for histopathological examination to study the course of re-epithelization. A score sheet was developed to assess the regeneration of epidermal and dermal cell types. Wounds were covered by a thin epidermal layer between 4 and 6 h post-clipping at 10 and 14 °C. In contrast, wound closure was completed between 6 and 12 h in fish held at a constant temperature of 4 °C. By 18 h post-clipping, superficial cells, cuboidal cells, prismatic basal cells and mucous cells were discernible in all temperature groups, rapidly progressing towards normal epidermal structure and thickness. Within the observation period, only minor regeneration was found in the dermal layers. A positive correlation between water temperature and healing rates was established for the epidermis. The rapid wound closure rate, epidermal normalization and the absence of inflammatory reaction signs suggest that adipose fin clipping under anaesthesia constitutes a minimally invasive method that may be used to mark large numbers of salmon presmolts without compromising fish welfare.

AB  - Abstract Biotransport is often associated with migration patterns of species, including large, anadromous salmonids. Several studies have reported biotransport of persistent organic pollutants in the Northern Hemisphere, but there is no published information on biotransport ocurring south of the equator. Chile’s Patagonia is one of the last largely intact natural areas in the world. The objective of this study was to determine whether persistent organic pollutants are transported by the invasive Pacific Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) from the Pacific Ocean to Chilean Patagonia. Samples of juvenile and adult Chinook salmon were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The results revealed that concentrations of POPs in adults migrating into Patagonian rivers were significantly higher than those found in juveniles migrating seaward. A mass balance analysis indicates that Chinook salmon are a source of persistent organic pollutants to Chilean Patagonia inland waters. Capsule: Biotransport of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) by Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) from the Pacific Ocean to Chilean Patagonia has been confirmed by mass balance of POPs.

AB  - Abstract Sustainable intensification (SI) is defined and interpreted in terms of a framework to support production of farmed aquatic animals in Asia and their trade with Europe. A novel holistic perspective to value chain analysis, informed by a range of sustainability tools, is used to explain the dynamic in the trade that is having significant impacts on livelihoods in both regions. The origins of SI in agriculture are first described and their congruence with aquaculture clarified. Asian aquaculture systems, based on their emergent properties, are then located within a SI framework considering possible boundaries (enterprise, zone or whole value chain). The implications of conventional intensification, and alternatives are explored with reference to specific examples and impacts on the local and global environment, human and aquatic animal health and welfare. The challenges to sustainability of such value chains and implications for their governance, food culture and consumer habits are considered. Local consumption of seafood in Asia is found to be a major driver of growth and alternative markets for exports regionally and in Low and Medium income countries (LMIC) are likely to impact on employment and power in the value chain between Europe and Asia. The benefits of viewing farmed seafood as part of broader food landscapes are identified in the analysis, as is a shift in the focus from volume to value in terms of goal setting. More holistic perspectives of sustainability also emerge as necessary to describe and interpret global value chains rather than limited reductionist, production- orientated views. A diversity of trends in the development of farmed seafood is identified in contrast to any simplistic move to intensification, likely informed by economic, environmental and social factors in producer and consumer countries. Statement of relevance Global imbalances in production and consumption of farmed seafood are stimulating trade between Asia and Europe. The dynamic of global value chains around this emergent trade and their alignment with broader sustainability criteria, as applied to sustainable intensification of food production, are highly relevant to global food security.

AB  - Domesticated individuals are likely to be maladaptive in the wild due to adaptation to captivity. Escaped aquaculture fish can cause unintended fitness and demographic consequences for their wild conspecifics through interbreeding and competition. Escape events from different sources exhibit great heterogeneity in their frequencies and magnitudes, ranging from rare but large spillover during a storm, to continuous low-level leakage caused by operational errors. The timescale of escape events determines the distribution of gene flow from aquaculture to the wild. The evolutionary consequences of this variation in timescale will depend on the degree of generation overlap and the focal species' life history attributes, especially those under selection in aquaculture (e.g., growth rate, which can influence additional demographically important traits such as age at maturity). To evaluate the effects of variable escape both within and across generations, we construct an age-structured model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics and parameterize it for species with contrasting life history characteristics (Salmo salar and Gadus morhua). Our results are consistent with earlier discrete-generation models that constant, low-level spillover can have a greater impact than rare, large pulses of leakage, even after accounting for the averaging effects of overlapping generations. The age-structured model also allows detailed evaluation of the role of different life history traits, which reveals that species with longer generation times might experience greater fitness consequences of aquaculture spillover but are less sensitive to variability in spillover. Additionally, environment-induced earlier maturity of escapees can increase the fitness effects on wild fish, especially those with shorter generation times. Our results suggest that effective management to minimize the unintended fitness consequences of aquaculture releases might require extensive monitoring efforts on constant, low-level spillover and assessment of the focal species' life history characteristics.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study investigated the effects of water and feed‐derived boron on the growth performance and blood parameters of Nile tilapia fingerlings. Two different experiments were designed for this purpose. The first phase of the study determined the LC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> (96‐h) value of boron for Nile tilapia. Fish were then fed in water containing boron at a ratio of 1:20 of the LC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> value. In the second experiment, feed containing boron at different rates (0.00%, 0.01%, 0.05%, and 0.10%) was fed for 40 days. At the end of the feeding period, growth performance, hematology, and blood biochemistry parameters were determined. The study concluded with a calculated LC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> value of 161.053 mg/L boron for Nile tilapia. The initial weight was 12.51 ± 0.79 g; at the end of feeding, the final weights were determined as 26.36 ± 0.15 g for the control and 28.07 ± 0.23, 32.28 ± 0.25 and 24.81 ± 0.48 g for 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.10% of boron feed treatments, respectively. At the end of feeding in water containing boron, the final weight of Nile tilapia was determined as 24.26 ± 0.26 g (LC<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>/20%). The results showed that feeding Nile tilapia with 0.05% boron‐supplemented feed stimulated growth and positively affected blood parameters, whereas waterborne boron inhibited Nile tilapia growth and negatively affected blood parameters.</jats:p>

AB  - Farmed fish welfare has become an important factor in consumers' purchasing decisions. The objective of this study is twofold: (1) to investigate consumers' preference and willingness to pay for farmed fish welfare and (2) to measure the effect of social desirability on consumers' responses. A self-administered online survey was developed and distributed to an Internet panel in Denmark. Discrete choice experiment was used to elicit consumers' preference and willingness to pay for fish welfare. Direct and indirect questioning were used when an individual was asked to make a decision in the discrete choice experiment. Respondents were asked to make their own purchase decision in direct questioning (i.e., the fish product s/he would like to buy), while in indirect questioning, they were asked to make decisions for others (i.e., the most sold product in the market). The results revealed that attributes such as the form of fish, labeling, price, and premium had an influence on consumers' choice of fish. Specifically, consumers were generally willing to pay more in premium for fish that had a “fish welfare guaranteed” label. Consumer heterogeneity was disclosed in consumer preference and willingness to pay. Results also showed that consumers believe other consumers would be likely to pay less for fish welfare than themselves. Thus, the results revealed that social desirability could create bias when valuing fish welfare.

AB  - Escapes of farmed fish from coastal farms around the world are believed to have genetic and ecological consequences for wild fish populations. Each year there are numerous escapes of adult farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. However, survival until maturity appears to be low. One possible explanation is that many of these salmon have difficulties switching to live prey. To address this possibility, growth rate and dietary preference were recorded in recaptured salmon released in 3 groups from August to October 2008 within a small fjord in south-western Norway (Masfjord). The fish were primed with a commercial diet containing 11% of the 'vegetable oil marker' 18:2n-6 before release. In the 14.5 to 35.1% of fish recaptured, growth rates were generally good (0.21-1.23% d -1 of fish recaptured in main fjord >2 mo after release), with body weight doubled or more for fish recap- tured after 19 wk and thereafter. However, fish recaptured in a small arm of Masfjord (Hopsvag) had a growth rate close to zero and were in poor condition. While stomachs of recaptured fish were gen- erally empty in the first weeks after release, pellets from fish farms were found in more than 80% of the stomachs after 12 wk and thereafter. Additionally, the level of 18:2n-6 in depot lipids (11% of fatty acids) of the muscle indicated that none of the fish recaptured the following autumn and winter in the vicinity of the release site had switched to wild prey diets. Salmon that escape during autumn are unlikely to compete for prey with wild fish in the vicinity of the release site.

	    <jats:p>Decision making frequently entails the selection and application of assessment tools. For sustainability decisions there are a plethora of tools available for environmental assessment, yet no established and clear approach to determine which tools are appropriate and resource efficient for application. Here we present an extensive inventory of tools and a novel taxonomic method which enables efficient, effective tool selection to improve decision making for policymakers and managers. The tool selection methodology follows four main phases based on the divergence-convergence logic; a scoping phase, cataloging phase, selection phase and validation phase. This approach combines elements of data-driven analysis with participatory techniques for stakeholder engagement to achieve buy-in and to ensure efficient management of progress and agile course correction when needed. It builds on the current limited range and scope of approaches to tool selection, and is flexible and Artificial Intelligence-ready in order to facilitate more rapid integration and uptake. Using the food system as a case study, we demonstrate how practitioners can use available input variables and desired output metrics to select the most appropriate tools to manage sustainability risks, with the approach having wide applicability to other sectors.</jats:p>

AB  - Sea cages used for fish farming are typically open to the environment, making the grow-out phase a race against the accumulation of infections. In Norway, farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) suffer outbreaks of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which by law must be managed, and comorbid infections that weaken salmon and increase the risk of mortality following delousing treatments. To understand the role of louse management on size-at-harvest, we analysed monthly data from 1054 salmon farms over a 10-year period. Mean weight at harvest declined 6.6% (−310 g) from 2012 to 2021, with the smallest size-at-harvest occurring in months when delousing treatments were reported. In 2021, size-at-harvest was 3.4% smaller during treatment vs. non-treatment months. There is a pattern of increasing responsiveness to louse outbreaks over time, with delousing treatments preferred for small fish and harvesting preferred for large fish. There are also several lines of evidence suggesting that potential post-treatment mortalities are sometimes diverted to harvest statistics. Treatments tend to lead to higher relative mortality in the following month, except when a harvest was also reported during the treatment month. Stunboats are harvesting vessels equipped with stunning, bleeding and chilling systems, and anecdotally, are preferred for ‘emergency’ harvests. We found that stunboat visits were disproportionately associated with harvests of small fish during 2018–2021. Moreover, stunboats often visited during treatment months without any harvest being reported, consistent with accounts of stunboats standing by during risky operations to salvage moribund fish if necessary. Because harvests and mortalities are reported monthly, it is not clear how often harvests during treatment months reflect (i) harvesting of vulnerable fish as an alternative to treating, or (ii) risky treatments that produce moribund fish. However, if the latter is common, mortality statistics will underestimate the health and welfare risks of delousing treatments.

AB  - Global losses of biodiversity are occurring at an unprecedented rate, but causes are often unidentified. Genomic data provide an opportunity to isolate drivers of change and even predict future vulnerabilities. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations have declined range-wide, but factors responsible are poorly understood. Here, we reconstruct changes in effective population size (Ne) in recent decades for 172 range-wide populations using a linkage-based method. Across the North Atlantic, Ne has significantly declined in >60% of populations and declines are consistently temperature-associated. We identify significant polygenic associations with decline, involving genomic regions related to metabolic, developmental, and physiological processes. These regions exhibit changes in presumably adaptive diversity in declining populations consistent with contemporary shifts in body size and phenology. Genomic signatures of widespread population decline and associated risk scores allow direct and potentially predictive links between population fitness and genotype, highlighting the power of genomic resources to assess population vulnerability.

AB  - Purpose




The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of biotechnological inventions and innovations on the organization of the burgeoning Atlantic salmon farming industry.




Design/methodology/approach




The authors study how novel biotechnological inventions are utilized within Atlantic salmon aquaculture. The authors compare the findings with the historical development path of invention and innovation in the plant sector, and explore parallels and dissimilarities between the plant breeding sector and Atlantic salmon aquaculture.




Findings




The innovation capacity within Atlantic salmon aquaculture is distinct from the plant sector, but nonetheless likely to become equifinal. Similar to plants, the female fecundity of salmon is high. Hybridization, which is an effective mechanism for protection of investments in high fecundity organisms, is less effective in salmon farming because the genetic variability is higher in salmon. Hybridization provides plant breeders with significant power over grow-out farmers. The development path in Atlantic salmon sector is distinctively dissimilar from plants, but salmon farmers nonetheless appear to move toward the structural configurations that are parallel to the plant sector. The significance of new breeding technologies in Atlantic salmon farming ascends, and will play an increasingly important role in the further development of this industry.




Research limitations/implications




The study contributes to the prevailing knowledge of how inventions and innovations influence the future development of the Atlantic salmon industry.




Originality/value




Biotechnological inventions are evolving within aquaculture. So far, the implications of novel biotechnological possibilities for the Atlantic salmon sector have been underanalyzed. The paper explores these implications from the perspective of political economy.

AB  - Many native Atlantic salmon populations have been invaded by domesticated escapees for three decades or longer. However, thus far, the cumulative level of gene-flow that has occurred from farmed to wild salmon has not been reported for any native Atlantic salmon population. The aim of the present study was to investigate temporal genetic stability in native populations, and, quantify gene-flow from farmed salmon that caused genetic changes where they were observed. This was achieved by genotyping historical and contemporary samples from 20 populations covering all of Norway with recently identified single nucleotide polymorphism markers that are collectively diagnostic for farmed and wild salmon. These analyses were combined with analysis of farmed salmon and implementation of Approximate Bayesian computation based simulations. Five of the populations displayed statistically significant temporal genetic changes. All five of these populations became more similar to a pool of farmed fish with time, strongly suggesting introgression of farmed fish as the primary cause. The remaining 15 populations displayed weak or non-significant temporal genetic changes. Estimated introgression of farmed fish ranged from 2-47% per population using approximate Bayesian computation. Thus, some populations exhibited high degrees of farmed salmon introgression while others were more or less unaffected. The observed frequency of escapees in each population was moderately correlated with estimated introgression per population R2 = 0.47 P < 0.001. Genetic isolation by distance existed within the historical and contemporary data sets, however, the among-population level of divergence decreased with time. This is the first study to quantify cumulative introgression of farmed salmon in any native Atlantic salmon population. The estimations demonstrate that the level of introgression has been population-specific, and that the level of introgression is not solely predicted by the frequency of escapees observed in the population. However, some populations have been strongly admixed with farmed salmon, and these data provide policy makers with unique information to address this situation.

AB  - Summary In this study we discuss impact categories and indicators to incorporate local ecological impacts into life cycle assessment (LCA) for aquaculture. We focus on the production stages of salmon farming—freshwater hatcheries used to produce smolts and marine growout sites using open netpens. Specifically, we propose two impact categories: impacts of nutrient release and impacts on biodiversity. Proposed indicators for impacts of nutrient release are (1) the area altered by farm waste, (2) changes in nutrient concentration in the water column, (3) the percent of carrying capacity reached, (4) the percent of total anthropogenic nutrient release, and (5) release of wastes into freshwater. Proposed indicators for impacts on biodiversity are (1) the number of escaped salmon, (2) the number of reported disease outbreaks, (3) parasite abundance on farms, and (4) the percent reduction in wild salmon survival. For each proposed indicator, an example of how the indicator could be estimated is given and the strengths and weaknesses of that indicator are discussed. We propose that including local environmental impacts as well as global-scale ones in LCA allows us to better identify potential trade-offs, where actions that are beneficial at one scale are harmful at another, and synchronicities, where actions have desirable or undesirable effects at both spatial scales. We also discuss the potential applicability of meta-analytic statistical techniques to LCA.

AB  - The Gulf of Oman, an ecologically and economically rich ecosystem, is frequently impacted by occurrences of harmful algal blooms. Recent studies indicate an increase in the number of causative species and harmful impacts. Many red tide incidents in Oman have been found leading to hypoxia. The frequent bloom forming species here are Karenia selliformis , Nitzschia pungens , Prorocentrum arabianum and Trichodesmium erythraeum . We review work carried out in this area, and we propose here a Management Action Plan for not only an effective monitoring system for harmful algal blooms (HABs), but also mitigation of their adverse impacts and rapid response system.

AB  - Migration can reduce parasite burdens in migratory hosts, but it connects populations and can drive disease dynamics in domestic species. Farmed salmon are infested by sea louse parasites, often carried by migratory wild salmonids, resulting in a costly problem for industry and risk to wild populations when farms amplify louse numbers. Chemical treatment can control lice, but resistance has evolved in many salmon-farming regions. Resistance has, however, been slow to evolve in the north-east Pacific Ocean, where large wild-salmon populations harbour large sea louse populations. Using a mathematical model of host-macroparasite dynamics, we explored the roles of domestic, wild oceanic and connective migratory host populations in maintaining treatment susceptibility in associated sea lice. Our results show that a large wild salmon population, unexposed to direct infestation by lice from farms; high levels of on-farm treatment; and a healthy migratory host population are all critical to slowing or stopping the evolution of treatment resistance. Our results reproduce the "high-dose/refuge effect," from the agricultural literature, with the added requirement of a migratory host population to maintain treatment susceptibility. This work highlights the role that migratory hosts may play in shared wildlife/livestock disease, where evolution can occur in ecological time.

AB  - Sea lice are the most significant parasitic problem affecting wild and farmed salmon. Larval lice released from infected fish in salmon farms and their transport by water masses results in inter-farm networks of lice dispersal. Understanding this parasite connectivity is key to its control and effective management. Quantify the spatial and seasonal patterns in sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) dispersal in an area with intensive salmon farming. Identify emergent clusters in the network, where associated salmon farms could be used for coordinated management and spatial planning of the industry. We used a biophysical model to simulate lice dispersal from 537 salmon farms along the Norwegian coastline for two seasons (spring and winter) from 2009 to 2014. We used network analysis to characterize dispersal pathways and quantify the spatial and temporal patterns in connectivity. Lice dispersal patterns and network metrics varied greatly between seasons, but differences were consistent amongst years. Winter networks presented more connections, and links were on average two times longer (average winter median = 36.5 ± 7.6 km, mean ± SE; average spring median = 17.8 ± 1.7 km). We identified 12 emergent farm clusters, which were similar across seasons and with the production areas for salmon aquaculture proposed by the Norwegian government. Seasonal variations in lice development times, oceanographic processes and the topological arrangement of salmon farms affect lice dispersal patterns. We have identified a biologically meaningful and politically tractable alliance structure for sea lice management consisting of closely-associated clusters of farms.

AB  - Exposure to community reservoirs of gram-negative antibiotic-resistant bacteria (GN-ARB) genes poses substantial health risks to individuals, complicating potential infections. Transmission networks and population dynamics remain unclear, particularly in resource-poor communities. We use a dynamic compartment model to assess GN-ARB transmission quantitatively, including the susceptible, colonised, infected, and removed populations at the community-hospital interface. We used two side streams to distinguish between individuals at high- and low-risk exposure to community ARB reservoirs. The model was calibrated using data from a cross-sectional cohort study (N = 357) in Chile and supplemented by existing literature. Most individuals acquired ARB from the community reservoirs (98%) rather than the hospital. High exposure to GN-ARB reservoirs was associated with 17% and 16% greater prevalence for GN-ARB carriage in the hospital and community settings, respectively. The higher exposure has led to 16% more infections and attributed mortality. Our results highlight the need for early-stage identification and testing capability of bloodstream infections caused by GN-ARB through a faster response at the community level, where most GN-ARB are likely to be acquired. Increasing treatment rates for individuals colonised or infected by GN-ARB and controlling the exposure to antibiotic consumption and GN-ARB reservoirs, is crucial to curve GN-ABR transmission.

        <p>Background
 Salmon aquaculture involves freshwater and seawater phases. Recently there has been an increase in multifactorial gill health challenges during the seawater phase which has led to an urgent need to understand the gill microbiome. There is a lack of understanding on what drives the composition of the gill microbiome, and the influence the freshwater stage has on its long-term composition. We characterise the gill microbiome from seven cohorts of Atlantic salmon raised in six different freshwater operational systems - recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), flowthrough (FT) and loch-based system, prior to and after transfer to seven seawater farms, over two different input seasons, S0 (2018) and S1 (2019).
Results
 Using the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene, we produced amplicon libraries absent of host contamination. We show that hatchery system influenced the gill microbiome (PERMAOVA R2 = 0.226, P &lt; 0.001). Loch and FT systems were more similar to each other than the three RAS systems, which clustered together. On transfer to sea, the gill microbiomes of all fish changed and became more similar irrespective of initial hatchery system, seawater farm location or season of input. Even though the gill microbiome among seawater farm locations was different between locations (PERMAOVA R2 = 0.528, P &lt; 0.001), a clustering of the gill microbiomes by hatchery system of origin was still observed soon after transfer (PERMAOVA R = 0.164, P &lt; 0.001). Core microbiomes were found between all salmon, hatcheries and seawater groups at a genus level, and at ASV level among FT and loch systems; and again among all seawater farms. The gill microbiome and surrounding water at each hatchery had more shared ASVs than seawater farms.
Conclusion
 We show that hatchery system, loch, FT or RAS, significantly impacts the gill microbiome. On transfer to sea, the microbiomes change and become more similar. After transfer, the individual sites to which the fish are transferred become a significant driver, while a signature from the hatchery operation system remains. Future gill disease mitigation methods that target enhancing the gill microbiome may be most effective in the freshwater stage, as there were more shared ASVs between water and gill at hatchery, compared to at sea.</p>

AB  - Global population growth and changing diets increase the importance, and challenges, of reducing the environmental impacts of food production. Farmed seafood is a relatively efficient way to produce protein and has already overtaken wild fisheries. The use of protein-rich food crops, such as soy, instead of fishmeal in aquaculture feed diverts these important protein sources away from direct human consumption and creates new environmental challenges. Single cell proteins (SCPs), including bacteria and yeast, have recently emerged as replacements for plant-based proteins in salmon feeds. Attributional life cycle assessment is used to compare salmon feeds based on protein from soy, methanotrophic bacteria, and yeast ingredients. All ingredients are modeled at the industrial production scale and compared based on seven resource use and emissions indicators. Yeast protein concentrate showed drastically lower impacts in all categories compared to soy protein concentrate. Bacteria meal also had lower impacts than soy protein concentrate for five of the seven indicators. When these target meals were incorporated into complete feeds the relative trends remain fairly constant, but benefits of the novel ingredients are dampened by high impacts from the nontarget ingredients. Particularly, primary production requirements (PPR) are about equal and constant across all feeds for both analyses since PPR was driven by fishmeal and oil. The bacteria-based feed has the highest climate change impacts due to the use of methane to feed the bacteria who then release carbon dioxide. Overall, the results of this study suggest that incorporating SCP ingredients into salmon feeds can help reduce the environmental impacts of salmon production. Continued improvements in SCP production would further increase the sustainability of salmon farming.

AB  - The goal of this research was to shed light on the trade-offs that salmon consumers make between five types of production and health attributes of farmed salmon. In Canada, the major southern Ontario market cleaved into five distinct consumer segments that varied according to age and income, ‘tastes’, and threat perceptions. There was strong consumer aversion to increased levels of PCBs, even when increased contamination levels were well within Health Canada guidelines. Both contaminant avoidance and polyunsaturated fatty acid health benefits were generally more important to consumers than improved environmental performance in salmon farming production practices. The strong consumer preferences for reduced levels of PCBs in salmon flesh suggest that there could be a substantial market premium for farmed salmon produced using reduced levels of fish meal and fish oils in salmon feed. This could, by association, increase the environmental sustainability of salmon farming.

AB  - Chattonella marina algal blooms have been associated with major farmed and wild fish mortalities in tropical (Mexico), subtropical (South Australia) and temperate regions (Japan). However, the precise toxic mechanisms involved remain incompletely known and disputed. A novel sensitive in vitro assay using the rainbow trout cell line RTgill-W1 was developed to assess toxicity of lipid extracts, ruptured cells and intact cultures of 6 strains of C. marina. Chattonella was found to be less toxic than the haptophyte Prymnesium parvum, but more toxic than the raphidophytes Heterosigma akashiwo, Fibrocapsa japonica and dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi. Ruptured cells from Australian CMPL01 and Japanese N-118 C. marina strains were the most toxic, decreasing gill cell viability by 71 and 65%, respectively. The Mexican CMCV-1 strain was the least toxic (35%), possibly because it is larger and less fragile than other strains. Chattonella marina is unique among ichthyotoxic microalgae in its high production of superoxide anion (19 pmol cell\(^{-1}\) hr\(^{-1}\)). Sonicated cultures showed higher levels of superoxide than intact cultures (19.0 vs 9.5 pmol cell\(^{-1}\) hr\(^{-1}\), respectively). However, O\(^2\) - on its own did not appear to be the main cause of toxicity (only 14% loss of cell viability). Superoxide production was highest when grown in medium enriched with 1 μM Fe(III) compared to the 5 μM standard medium (25 vs 9.5 pmol cell\(^{-1}\) hr\(^{-1}\)), especially after a sudden change from dark adaptation to light conditions (200 μmol photons m\(^{-2}\) s-1) (up to 37.6), but lowest (4.1) at 100 nM Fe(III). The three major fatty acids in C. marina were palmitic (PA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and octadecatetraenoic (OTA) acids. Higher levels of EPA were found in ruptured cells (21.4 – 29.4% of total fatty acids) compared to intact cells (8.5 – 25.3%). Gill damaging effects from free fatty acid (FFA) fractions were conclusively demonstrated (LC\(_{50}\) at 1 hr of 0.44 μg mL\(^{-1}\)), and remain candidates of ichthyotoxicity when well-defined toxins such as brevetoxin or karlotoxin can be ruled out as causative factors. The aldehydes 2E,4E-decadienal and 2E,4E-heptadienal, which may be generated by FFA oxidation, also showed high impacts on gill cell viability, with LC\(_{50}\) (at 1 hr) of 0.34 and 0.36 μg mL\(^{-1}\), respectively. In conclusion, C. marina was more toxic after cell disruption and when switching from dark to light conditions, associated with higher EPA levels and a higher production of superoxide anion. Implications of this work for finfish aquaculture management and mitigation are discussed.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="AIM" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">Dermaseptins are one of the main families of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from the skin secretions of Hylidae frogs. Among them, dermaseptin S4 (DS4) is characterized by its broad-spectrum of activity against bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. In this study, the physicochemical properties of the native peptide DS4 (1-28) and two derivatives [DS4 (1-28)a and DS4 (1-26)a] isolated from the skin of the frog Phyllomedusa sauvagii were investigated and their antimicrobial properties against two marine pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio anguillarum) were examined.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS AND RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The results indicate that the peptide DS4 (1-26)a has high-antibacterial activity against the tested strains and low-hemolytic activity (&lt;30% lysis at the highest tested concentration of 100 µg/mL) compared to the other two peptides tested. In addition, all three peptides affect the membrane and cell wall integrity of both pathogenic bacteria, causing leakage of cell contents, with DS4 (1-26)a having the most severe impact. These skills were corroborated by transmission electron microscopy and by the variation of cations in their binding sites due to the effects caused by the AMPs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">These results suggest that DS4 and its derivatives, in particular the truncated and amidated peptide DS4 (1-26)a could be effective in the treatment of infections caused by these marine pathogenic bacteria. Future studies are required to validate the use of DS4  in vivo for the prevention of bacterial diseases in fish.</AbstractText>

AB  - Abstract Cardiovascular disease may pose a major threat to the health and welfare of farmed fish. By investigating a range of established cardiovascular disease indicators, we aimed to determine the prevalence, severity and consequences of this affliction in farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from an open cage farm in the Baltic Sea, an open cage farm in a freshwater lake, and a land-based recirculating aquaculture system. We also aimed to identify environmental, anthropogenic and physiological factors contributing towards the development of the disease. The majority of trout possessed enlarged hearts with rounded ventricles (mean height:width ratios of 1.0–1.1 c.f. ~1.3 in wild fish) and a high degree of vessel misalignment (mean angles between the longitudinal ventricular axis and the axis of the bulbus arteriosus of 28–31 °c.f. ~23° in wild fish). The prevalence and severity of coronary arteriosclerosis was also high, as 92–100% of fish from the different aquaculture facilities exhibited coronary lesions. Mean lesion incidence and severity indices were 67–95% and 3.1–3.9, respectively, which resulted in mean coronary arterial blockages of 19–32%. To evaluate the functional significance of these findings, we modelled the effects of arterial blockages on coronary blood flow and experimentally tested the effects of coronary occlusion in a sub-sample of fish. The observed coronary blockages were estimated to reduce coronary blood flow by 34–54% while experimental coronary occlusion adversely affected the electrocardiogram of trout. Across a range of environmental (water current, predation), anthropogenic (boat traffic intensity, hatchery of origin, brand of feed pellets) and physiological factors (condition factor, haematological and plasma indices), the hatchery of origin was the main factor contributing towards the observed variation in the development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, further research on the effects of selective breeding programs and rearing strategies on the development of cardiovascular disease is needed to improve the welfare and health of farmed fish.

AB  - This chapter focuses on open floating sea cages, which are those most used for intensive aquaculture. The description and calculation of waves and wave forces are quite difficult, and the chapter gives only a brief survey. Waves, current and wind all transfer energy to the sea cage farm; a part of this energy will only pass through the farm, but a part will be taken up in the sea cages. The difference between the incoming energy and the energy on the other side of the farm determines the energy that the farm construction and mooring system have to take up. There is a lot to consider when calculating the current forces on sea cages, and usually specially designed computer programs are used for this purpose. A simple set of equations and diagrams have been developed for calculation of the current forces on rigid sea cages.

AB  - <jats:p>The sustainability of mariculture depends on adopting green technologies, which can mitigate the negative impacts on the environment and ensure long-term viability. However, existing studies do not comprehensively understand the characteristics and regional differences of green technology progress (GTP) in mariculture. According to data from ten coastal regions from 2008 to 2020, this study adopts the Epsilon-Based Measure (EBM)-Malmquist model to measure the GTP of mariculture, uses the Dagum Gini coefficient to analyze the spatial differences of GTP, and uses convergence models to explore the convergence of GTP. The results showed that: (1) the GTP of China’s mariculture showed a fluctuating upward trend temporally and significant spatial differences. The overall differences showed a dispersion trend over time. The contributions of inter-regional super variable net value difference (Gnb), inter-regional transvariation intensity (Gt), and intra-regional difference (Gw) were 38.813%, 31.256%, and 29.931%, respectively. (2) The degree of dispersion of GTP among different regions has not decreased with time, which means there is no apparent σ convergence. Absolute β convergence and conditional β convergence existed in GTP, and the absolute value of the latter was greater than that of the former. That is, the growth rate of GTP will first reach their respective steady-state levels and then approach a unified steady-state equilibrium level.</jats:p>

AB  - Study Goals and Objectives:
 
1) Improve existing nutrient-related eutrophication assessment methods, updating (from early 1990s to early 2000s) the eutrophication assessment for systems included in the study with the improved method.

2) Develop a human-use/socioeconomic indicator to complement the assessment indicator. The human-use indicator was developed to evaluate costs of nutrient-related degradation in coastal waters and to put the issue into a broader context relevant to the interested public and legislators as well as to scientists.

3) Project objectives included collecting existing water quality data, developing an accessible database appropriate for application to a national study, and applying the assessment methods to 14 coastal systems – nine systems north of Cape Cod and five systems south. The geographical distribution of systems was used to examine potential regional differences in condition.

4) The intent is to use the lessons learned in this pilot study on a national scale to guide completion of an update of the 1999 National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment.

AB  - Hybridization between wild and escaped cultured Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can threaten the stability and persistence of locally adapted wild populations. Here we describe the development and validation of a genomic-based approach to quantify recent hybridization between escapee and wild salmon in the western Atlantic. Based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scans of wild and cultured salmon, collectively diagnostic panels were created for Newfoundland and the Canadian Maritimes. These panels were capable of both discriminating hybrids from nonhybrids and of correctly assigning individuals to hybrid class (i.e., pure wild, pure farm, F1, F2, and backcrosses) with a high degree of accuracy (Newfoundland 96 SNPs > 90%, Maritimes 720 SNPs > 80%). These genomic panels permit the assessment of the impacts of past and future farmed salmon escape events on wild populations and can inform the protection and conservation of wild Atlantic salmon genetic integrity in the western Atlantic.

AB  - <jats:p>It has long been clear that interbreeding between domesticated and wild Atlantic salmon can lead to negative fitness consequences for native populations. Few studies, however, have examined these consequences at critical early life stages, particularly in the context of distinct geographical and ancestral relationships among populations as well domestication selection. In Newfoundland (NF), Canada, while the majority of aquaculture sites use the North American (NA) Saint John River strain, site-specific permission has been granted to farm a strain of European origin (EO). We designed a common-garden experiment to compare fitness-related traits (e.g. development time, survival, size and growth) at different early-life stages (eye development, hatch and yolk absorption) among EO and NA farmed, 2 NF wild and F<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>hybrid groups. Significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) were observed in development time, survival, growth and energy conversion among farmed, F<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>hybrid and wild populations. While pure populations (farmed and wild) differed amongst one another, we found few differences in fitness-related traits between F<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>hybrids and their maternal wild/farmed strains. This suggests that the early-life fitness consequences of F<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>hybridization will be largely manifested through the action of maternal effects. Additionally, significant associations between the maternal effects of egg size and alevin development time, size, survival, growth, condition and energy conversion efficiency were found. These findings suggest that early-life fitness-related trait differences among farmed, wild and their related F<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>hybrids are generated by the geographic and ancestral relationship and maternal effects of egg size and less so by domestication selection.</jats:p>

AB  - The rapid development of intensive fed aquaculture (e.g. finfish and shrimp) throughout the world is associated with concerns about the environmental impacts of such often monospecific practices, especially where activities are highly geographically concentrated or located in suboptimal sites whose assimilative capacity is poorly understood and, consequently, prone to being exceeded. One of the main environmental issues is the direct discharge of significant nutrient loads into coastal waters from open-water systems and with the effluents from land-based systems. In its search for best management practices, the aquaculture industry should develop innovative and responsible practices that optimize its efficiency and create diversification, while ensuring the remediation of the consequences of its activities to maintain the health of coastal waters. To avoid pronounced shifts in coastal processes, conversion, not dilution, is a common-sense solution, used for centuries in Asian countries. By integrating fed aquaculture (finfish, shrimp) with inorganic and organic extractive aquaculture (seaweed and shellfish), the wastes of one resource user become a resource (fertilizer or food) for the others. Such a balanced ecosystem approach provides nutrient bioremediation capability, mutual benefits to the cocultured organisms, economic diversification by producing other value-added marine crops, and increased profitability per cultivation unit for the aquaculture industry. Moreover, as guidelines and regulations on aquaculture effluents are forthcoming in several countries, using appropriately selected seaweeds as renewable biological nutrient scrubbers represents a cost-effective means for reaching compliance by reducing the internalization of the total environmental costs. By adopting integrated polytrophic practices, the aquaculture industry should find increasing environmental, economic, and social acceptability and become a full and sustainable partner within the development of integrated coastal management frameworks.

AB  - <i>Artemisia ordosica</i> has been applied as a traditional Chinese/Mongolian medicine for treating csertain inflammatory ailments. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of <i>Artemisia ordosica</i> alcohol extract (AOAE) supplemented in diets on growth performance, immune, and inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged broilers. A total of 240 one-day-old Arbor Acre male broilers were randomly allotted into 5 groups with 6 replicates (<i>n</i> = 8), which were basal diet group (CON), LPS-challenge and basal diet group (LPS), LPS-challenge and the basal diet added with low (500 mg/kg), middle (750 mg/kg), and high (1,000 mg/kg) dose of AOAE groups (AOAE-L, AOAE-M, and AOAE-H), respectively. On d 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28, all broilers were injected intra-abdominally either with LPS or an equivalent amount of saline. Results showed that dietary AOAE alleviated the LPS-induced decrease in average daily gain and average daily feed intake in the broilers (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Dietary AOAE supplementation reversed the increased spleen index and the decreased bursa index in LPS-challenged broilers (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Moreover, feeding AOAE could mitigate the elevation of IL-1β in serum, liver, and spleen, IL-2 in serum and liver, IL-6 in serum and spleen, and the decrease of IgG in spleen, IgM in serum, liver, and spleen, and IL-4 in serum of the LPS-challenged broilers (<i>P</i> < 0.05). This study also showed that AOAE supplementation alleviated the increase of mRNA expression of <i>TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, NF-</i>κ<i>B p65, NF-</i>κ<i>B p50, IL-1</i>β, and <i>IL-6</i>, and the decrease of gene expression of <i>I</i>κ<i>B</i>α and <i>PPAR</i>γ in liver and/or spleen of broilers challenged by LPS (<i>P</i> < 0.05). We speculated that AOAE administration could effectively alleviate LPS-induced inflammation via decreasing over-production of proinflammatory cytokines, ultimately relieving the growth inhibition of broilers caused by LPS. In conclusion, 1,000 mg/kg AOAE has a strong capacity to enhance immunity and inhibit inflammation, and can be used as a potential novel feed additive with applications in treating inflammation-related diseases and bacterial infection in broilers.

AB  - Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) is an economically important fish species that is widely cultivated in Thailand. However, aquaculture of Asian seabass is limited by infectious diseases. One of the most serious diseases is photobacteriosis, caused by Photobacterium damselae. Vaccination is recognized as an efficient disease prevention and pathogen control method for strengthening the aquaculture industry. To promote vaccine development, the characterization of pathogenic bacteria and their pathogenesis is required. In this study, isolates of P. damselae were obtained from commercial aquaculture farms in Thailand during 2019-2021. Analyses of 16S rRNA and the urease subunit alpha genes identified the isolates as P. damselae subsp. damselae (Phdd). Antibiotic susceptibility analyses showed that all Phdd isolates were resistant to amoxicillin (10 μg). Haemolysis and phospholipase activities were used to categorize P. damselae into three groups based on their biological activities. The pathogenicity of four candidates (SK136, PD001, PD002 and T11L) was tested in Asian seabass. Isolate SK136 showed the highest virulence, with a lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of 1.47 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/fish, whereas isolate PD001 did not show any virulence. Genotypic characterization, based on multi-locus sequence typing analysis, demonstrated that all candidates were novel strains with new sequence types (64, 65, 66 and 67). Preliminary vaccination using formalin-killed cells (FKCs) protected Asian seabass from artificial challenges. Taken together, these results provide fundamental knowledge for vaccine development against Phdd infection in Asian seabass.

AB  - Walleye dermal sarcoma virus (WDSV) is a type of retrovirus, which affects most of the adult walleye fishes during the spawning time. The virus causes multiple epithelial tumors on the fish's skin and fins that are liable for more than 50% of the mortality rate of fish around the world. Till now, no effective antiviral drug or vaccine candidates have been developed that can block the progression of the disease caused by the pathogen. It was found that the 582-amino-acid (aa) residues long internal structural gag polyprotein of the virus plays an important role in virus budding and virion maturation outside of the cell. Inhibition of the protein can block the budding and virion maturation process and can be developed as an antiviral drug candidate against the virus. Therefore, the study aimed to identify potential natural antiviral drug candidates from the tropical mangrove marine plant Avicennia alba, which will be able to block the budding and virion maturation process by inhibiting the activity of the gag protein of the virus. Initially, a homology modeling approach was applied to identify the 3D structure, followed by refinement and validation of the protein. The refined protein structures were then utilized for molecular docking simulation. Eleven phytochemical compounds have been isolated from the marine plant and docked against the virus gag polyprotein. Three compounds, namely Friedlein (CID244297), Phytosterols (CID12303662), and 1-Triacontanol (CID68972) have been selected based on their docking score -8.5 kcal/mol, -8.0 kcal/mol and -7.9 kcal/mol, respectively, and were evaluated through ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion), and toxicity properties. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was applied to confirm the binding stability of the protein-ligands complex structure. The ADME and toxicity analysis reveal the efficacy and non-toxic properties of the compounds, where MD simulation confirmed the binding stability of the selected three compounds with the targeted protein. This computational study revealed the virtuous value of the selected three compounds against the targeted gag polyprotein and will be effective and promising antiviral candidates against the pathogen in a significant and worthwhile manner. Although in vitro and in vivo study is required for further evaluation of the compounds against the targeted protein.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In integrated multi‐trophic aquaculture (IMTA), species from different trophic levels are raised in proximity to one another and the co‐products (organic and inorganic wastes) of one cultured species are recycled to serve as nutritional inputs for others. IMTA can reduce the ecological impacts near aquaculture operations, improve social perceptions of aquaculture and provide financial benefits for aquaculture producers via product diversification, faster production cycles and price premiums on IMTA products. We review aspects of IMTA’s economic potential and market acceptance and consider ways to address the current gaps in our understanding. We find that adopting IMTA raises the assimilative capacity of the farm and that IMTA substantively reduces the environmental cost of aquaculture. Moreover, integrating extractive species (e.g. invertebrates and/or seaweeds), with existing fed‐monoculture operations, can increase farm profits. The presence of positive public attitudes towards IMTA, as expressed by a willingness to pay a premium for its products, can further increase the profitability of adopting IMTA. Areas requiring more economic research include the development of comparative bioeconomic models of IMTA and the evaluation of competing production systems and their ability to internalize externalities to demonstrate the true value of IMTA to society. Further exploration of economic incentives, such as instruments needed to foster adoption of IMTA, and investigation of marketing opportunities, such as promoting the eco‐certification of IMTA products, are also needed. Our paper aimed to inform economists and non‐economists alike about the latest developments in IMTA economics, and spur further research on critical topics concerning this important subject.</jats:p>

AB  - Seafood consumers are vastly heterogeneous in terms of their knowledge, confidence, and perceptions about seafood. This article examines the relationship between consumer perceptions (healthiness, value for money, and convenience) and salmon consumption frequencies while modeling unobserved consumer heterogeneity by segmenting consumers based on their food-related lifestyle. We employ latent class analysis (LCA) that embeds the structural equation modeling (SEM) to ensure the latent nature of both the consumer segment and the food lifestyle measures are properly accounted for. The analysis is applied to five European countries (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and Sweden). We contribute to the literature by providing new insights into how food lifestyle may influence the salmon consumption behavior by highlighting the differences among food lifestyle segments in different countries.

AB  - Global population growth will increase pressures on current food systems in order to supply adequate protein and produce to the increasingly urban world population. The environmental impact of food production is a critical area of study as it influences water and air quality, ecosystem functions, and energy consumption. Aquaponics (in which seafood and vegetables are grown in a closed-loop system) has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of food production. A review of the current environmental and economic considerations is provided in order to identify current research gaps. Research gaps exist with respect to 1) diversity of aquatic and plant species studied; 2) inconsistent bounds, scope, and lifetime across studies; 3) diverse allocation of the environmental and economic impacts to the coproducts; 4) scale of systems considered; 5) transportation of produced food; and 6) presence of heavy metals, pests, and pathogens with human health implications. These aspects require increased attention to close the existing gaps prior to widescale deployment of these systems for increased sustainable food production toward satisficing human needs.

This article examines a range of competition and collective action‐related interests that can motivate firms to promote and adopt certification schemes. We pay particular attention to the hitherto underexplored collective action interest to safeguard common‐pool resources, upon which an industry may depend to sustain yields. Based on a case study of salmon aquaculture certification, the article argues that while the corporate motives repertoire includes strengthening competitiveness and industry reputation, safeguarding shared waters for culturing salmon is key to explaining industry commitment to and adoption of private regulation in this sector.</jats:p>

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to examine the influence of consumers' perceived knowledge, knowledge discrepancy and confusion on the intention to purchase farmed fish (FF) via a survey design regarding perceptions, buying and consumption practices of urban households in Chittagong, Bangladesh.,The samples of 498 households were selected from a stratified cluster from the Chittagong city and were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The data have been analysed using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling.,The results show that consumers' subjective knowledge (SK) is significant for purchase intention whereas objective knowledge (OK) is not. Again, consumers' SK, OK, knowledge discrepancy and confusion have no influence in forming consumers' attitude towards FF. However, consumers who overestimate their actual level of knowledge hold negative attitude towards FF and vice versa. Furthermore, consumers' OK affects their confusion inversely although it does not influence the purchase intention significantly.,If the marketers can frame a more engaging means of communication and knowledge enhancement plan, consumers' attitude and purchase intention regarding FF will be signified.,This is the first study that fundamentally contributes to the scientific research in that it measures the knowledge discrepancy of consumers regarding FF. In addition, this study substantiates that low objective knowledge leads to confusing consumers at the time of purchasing. The effect of overestimating the level of knowledge as well as underestimating the level of knowledge in explaining the purchase intention of FF would be a supplementary addition.

AB  - Summary.
1. By any measure, fishes are among the world's most important natural resources. Annual exploitation from wild populations exceeds 90 million tonnes, and fish supply over 15% of global protein needs as part of total annual trade exceeding $US 55 billion. Additionally, with over 25 000 known species, the biodiversity and ecological roles of fishes are being increasingly recognised in aquatic conservation, ecosystem management, restoration and aquatic environmental regulation.
2. At the same time, substantial management problems now affect the production, exploitable stocks, global diversity, trophic structure, habitat quality and local composition of fish communities.
3. In marine systems, key issues include the direct effects of exploitation on fish, habitats and other organisms, while habitat or water quality problems arise also from the atmospheric, terrestrial and coastal environments to which marine systems are linked. In freshwaters, flow regulation and obstruction by dams, fragmentation, catchment management, pollution, habitat alterations, exotic fish introductions and nursery-reared fish are widespread issues.
4. Management responses to the problems of fish and fisheries include aquatic reserves in both marine and freshwater habitats, and their effectiveness is now being evaluated. Policies on marine exploitation increasingly emphasise fishes as integral components of aquatic ecosystems rather than individually exploitable stocks, but the rationalisation of fishing pressures presents many challenges. In Europe, North America and elsewhere, policies on freshwaters encourage habitat protection, integrated watershed management and restoration, but pressures on water resources will cause continued change. All these management approaches require development and evaluation, and will benefit from a perspective of ecological understanding with ecologists fully involved.
5. Synthesis and applications. Although making a small contribution to the Journal of Applied Ecology in the past, leading work on aquatic problems and fish-related themes appear increasingly in this and other mainstream ecology journals. As this special profile of five papers shows, significant contributions arise on diverse issues that here include the benefit of aquatic reserves, river restoration for fish, the accumulation of contaminants, interactions with predators, and the fitness of salmonids from nurseries. This overview outlines the current context in which papers on the applied ecology of fish and fisheries are emerging, and it identifies scope for further contributions.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cell‐based seafood is an emerging novel food, with many start‐up companies aspiring for ocean conservation benefits through expanded market share that displaces wild‐caught seafood. However, the ability for cell‐based seafood to achieve this conservation outcome is often oversimplified and will rely on an extensive, and we find somewhat tenuous, chain of events. Here, we outline the technological, behavioural, market and ecological changes that must occur along this pathway, and conclude that fisheries recoveries and collateral ocean benefits are unlikely to result from cell‐based seafood technology. In particular, we detail nine necessary steps and argue that failure at any one step could hinder or even eliminate cell‐based seafood's conservation effects. We additionally draw comparisons to aquaculture and share broader lessons for other demand‐driven product interventions.</jats:p>

AB  - Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. mykiss and Gracilaria chilensis cultivation in intensive tank systems is feasible. The environmental benefits associated with the development of integrated tank cultivation were established by analyzing previously published and unpublished data on fish production and food conversion efficiency, particle discharges in fish effluents, as well as biomass production, nutrient uptake effiency data ofGracilaria, with special emphasis on ammonium. The results indicate that fish production can reach 30 kg m-3 during a production cycle, and food conversion can be maintained stably at 1.4 g food g fish-1 production during the entire cultivation period. The solid particle discharges can be as high as 2.1 g (dry) kg fish-1 day-1 during the spring and summer, when salmon cultivation reaches its highest densities. The nutrient that increases most in fish effluents is ammonium, reaching concentrations as high as 500 µg 1-1 also in spring and summer.Gracilaria production can reach production rates as high as 48.9 kg m-2 year-1 and is able to remove 50% of the dissolved ammonium in winter, increasing to 90–95% in spring. These results are integrated into an income-analysis model, adding the extra income for Gracilaria harvesting and internalizing the environmental benefits for a 100-ton salmon production unit, which indicates that an additional total revenue of over US$ 60000, representing around 10% of the total income, is possible.

AB  - Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) have caused damage to the marine environment in Isla San Pedro in the Gulf of Corcovado, Chile. While rising water temperature and artificial eutrophication are the most discussed topics as a cause, marine bacteria is a recent attractive parameter as an algal bloom driver. This study monitored algal and bacterial compositions in the water of Isla San Pedro for one year using microscopy and 16S rRNA metabarcoding analysis, along with physicochemical parameters. The collected data were analyzed with various statistical tools to understand how the particle-associated bacteria (PA) and the free-living (FL) bacteria were possibly involved in algal blooms. Both FL and PA fractions maintained a stable bacterial composition: the FL fraction was dominated by Proteobacteria (α-Proteobacteria and γ-Proteobacteria), and Cyanobacteria dominated the PA fraction. The two fractions contained equivalent bacterial taxonomic richness (c.a. 8,000 Operational Taxonomic Units) and shared more than 50% of OTU; however, roughly 20% was exclusive to each fraction. The four most abundant algal genera in the Isla San Pedro water were <i>Thalassiosira, Skeletonema, Chaetoceros</i>, and <i>Pseudo-nitzchia</i>. Statistical analysis identified that the bacterial species <i>Polycyclovorans algicola</i> was correlated with <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp., and our monitoring data recorded a sudden increase of particle-associated <i>Polycyclovorans algicola</i> shortly after the increase of <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i>, suggesting that <i>P. algicola</i> may have regression effect on <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp. The study also investigated the physicochemical parameter effect on algal-bacterial interactions. Oxygen concentration and chlorophyll-<i>a</i> showed a strong correlation with both FL and PA bacteria despite their assemblage differences, suggesting that the two groups had different mechanisms for interacting with algal species.

AB  - Parasitic salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) are a constraint to the sustainable growth of salmonids in open net pens, and this issue has caused production to level off in recent years in the most aquaculture-intensive areas of Norway. The maximum allowed biomass at a regional level is regulated by using the so-called "traffic light" system, where salmon louse-induced mortality of migrating wild salmon post-smolts is evaluated against set targets. As a case study, we have investigated how a specific aquaculture-intensive area can reduce its louse levels sufficiently to achieve a low impact on wild salmon. Analyses of the output from a virtual post-smolt model that uses data on the reported number of salmon lice in fish farms as key input data and estimates the salmon louse-induced mortality of wild out-migrating Atlantic salmon post-smolts, suggested that female louse abundance on the local farms must be halved in spring to reach the goal implied by the traffic light system. The outcome of a modelling scenario simulating a proposed new plan for coordinated production and fallowing proved beneficial, with an overall reduction in louse infestations and treatment efforts. The interannual variability in louse abundance in spring, however, increased for this scenario, implying unacceptably high louse abundance when many farms were in their second production year. We then combined the scenario with coordinated production with other louse control measures. Only measures that reduced the density of farmed salmonids in open cages in the study area resulted in reductions in salmon louse infestations to acceptable levels. This could be achieved either by stocking with larger fish to reduce exposure time or by reducing fish numbers, e.g. by producing in closed units.

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Marine aquaculture is a very important economic and food production activity in Patagonian channels. The biophysical mechanisms through which farms interact with surrounding areas is poorly understood. A better understanding of the relationship between zooplankton distribution, hydrodynamics and aquaculture farms in Patagonian channels can contribute to the environmental sustainability of this activity.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                <jats:p>The study was conducted in winter in the Caucahué Channel (Chiloé Island, southern Chile), which is composed of two asymmetric northern and southern sections separated by a geomorphological constriction (a narrows) and hosts 55 aquaculture farms. Intensive zooplankton and water column sampling (time scale: 12 h) was carried out, together with current measurements as a background of the channel hydrodynamics (time scale: 30 days).</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Spatial dissimilarities in composition and abundances of zooplankton communities and in water column variables were identified between the two sections of the channel in this short-term time scale. In the southern section we found higher abundances of holo- and meroplankton and higher species richness. No differences in zooplankton community were found between sampling sites near and far from aquaculture farms. Southward asymmetrical residual flow and semidiurnal tidal excursion were verified in the central part of the channel during two tidal fortnightly time periods.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                <jats:p>(i) Clear dissimilarity in zooplankton composition were found between the two sections of Caucahué Channel in the time scale studied; and (ii) Quemchi geomorphological constriction and the asymmetrical southward residual flow could act as a physical barrier favoring the spatial dissimilarities found in biotic and abiotic variables between the two sections of the channel.

AB  - This paper evaluates the operational practices of three lobster fishing zones in Long Island using a finite mixture model that allows controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. More precisely, a stochastic frontier latent class model is adopted in this research to estimate the production frontiers for each of the different technologies embedded within this heterogeneity. Therefore, this model not only enables the identification of different groups within the fishing zones, but it also permits the analysis of their productive efficiency. Results indicate the existence of five different technology groups within the sample, suggesting that production technologies in lobster fishery are themselves quite heterogeneous despite the environmental conditions. Policy implications are also derived.

AB  - The circular economy has become the latest proposal to reduce the effects of prevailing modes of production in the environment. Its premise—that by breaking a linear understanding of production and creating new economic niches the environmental impacts of an economy can be reduced to zero—has attracted numerous industries under the loop for their negative environmental effects. The scalar implications of such policies remain to be fully understood, particularly in what may imply for changing relationships between resource peripheries and consumption centers. This chapter explores the case of the salmon industry to examine these implications critically. The salmon industry is a global production network connecting production sites in the global south and north with markets in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The ecological impacts of salmon farming are significant, and global environmental networks have pushed for increasing certifications schemes, which include circular economy actions. Thus, it becomes an interesting case to put in dialogue arguments from resource peripheries literature on disarticulations and ecological contradictions, with circular economy arguments on sustainability.

AB  - Synthetic pyrethroids such as cypermethrin and deltamethrin have been widely used in Chile to treat sea lice on salmon since 2007. The environmental risks of aquaculture practices are evaluated through the use of several tools such as fugacity-based models for predicting environmental dynamics and the fate of pyrethroids after their release into the marine environment and the determination of pyrethroid occurrence in environmental samples (i.e., water and sediment). For seawater, passive sampling devices (PSDs) are proposed as a good alternative for field monitoring. Finally, by means of ecotoxicological bioassays, the effects of pyrethroids on native biota were assessed. The results show that the application of pyrethroids may trigger some unintended risks to nontarget organisms, particularly copepods, since modeled and observed concentrations in water (dissolved phase) are in the range of fractions of ng L−1, but higher cypermethrin and deltamethrin concentrations in sediment in the range of 1,323 and 1,020 ng g−1, respectively, have been observed. These measured concentrations were in the range of concentrations toxic to native invertebrate species in Chile. We conclude that a stricter process should be followed when pyrethroids, particularly cypermethrin, are recommended for use in combating sea lice in the Chilean salmon farming industry. Risk assessment procedures and the establishment of stricter regulations on matters such as the maximum allowable concentrations around the cages when these pesticides are applied and recommended.

AB  - Freshwater inputs strongly influence oceanographic conditions in coastal systems of northwestern Patagonia (41–45°S). Nevertheless, the influence of freshwater on these systems has weakened in recent decades due to a marked decrease in precipitation. Here we evaluate potential influences of climate and land cover trends on the Puelo River (640 m3s-1), the main source of freshwater input of the Reloncavi Fjord (41.5oS). Water quality was analyzed along the Puelo River basin (six sampling points) and at the discharge site in the Reloncavi Fjord (1, 8, and 25 m depth), through six field campaigns carried out under contrasting streamflow scenarios. We also used several indicators of hydrological alteration, and cross-wavelet transform and coherence analyses to evaluate the association between the Puelo River streamflow and precipitation (1950-2019). Lastly, using the WEAP hydrological model, land cover maps (2001-2016) and burned area reconstructions (1985-2019), we simulated future land cover impacts (2030) on the hydrological processes of the Puelo River. Total Nitrogen and total phosphorus, dissolved carbon, and dissolved iron concentrations measured in the river were 3-15 times lower than those in the fjord. Multivariate analyses showed that streamflow drives the carbon composition in the river. High streamflow conditions contribute with humic and colored materials, while low streamflow conditions corresponded to higher arrival of protein-like materials from the basin. The Puelo River streamflow showed significant trends in magnitude (lower streamflow in summer and autumn), duration (minimum annual streamflow), timing (more floods in spring), and frequency. The land cover change (LCC) analysis indicated that more than 90% of the basin area maintained its land cover, and that the main changes were attributed to recent large wildfires. Considering these land cover trends, the hydrological simulations project a slight increase in the Puelo River streamflow mainly due to a decrease in evapotranspiration. According to previous simulations, these projections present a direction opposite to the trends forced by climate change. The combined effect of reduction in freshwater input to fiords and potential decline in water quality highlights the need for more robust data and robust analysis of the influence of climate and LCC on this river-fjord complex of northwestern Patagonia.

AB  - Abstract Globally, aquaculture is expanding rapidly, with salmon becoming one of the most dynamic and fast-growing production systems in the world. Despite its commercial success, Chilean salmon production has navigated through severe economic and sanitary crises; followed by consecutive policy changes. Between 2007 and 2009, the rapid spread and the multiple effects of the Infectious Salmon Anemia virus (ISAV) marked a tipping point in the trajectory of the salmon aquaculture in southern Chile. This paper examines the discursive mechanisms through which the Chilean salmon aquaculture industry is currently being re-framed in the aftermath of the ISAV crisis, with a focus on searching for the emergence of ecosystem-related elements post crisis. The analysis shows that Chilean salmon aquaculture is being re-framed by the reproduction of three main discourses: biosecurity, sustainable protein and The Promise of Patagonia. The paper concludes that despite the staggering effects of the ISAV crisis on the national salmon production and on coastal communities more than a decade ago, new discourses are focused on the legitimization to growth, in the absence of integrated marine ecosystem-related elements, indicating a crucial gap toward environmental sustainability in salmon aquaculture.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As marine aquaculture expands around the world, there is increased concern for impacts to protected species. Documented cases of marine mammal, sea turtle, seabird, and shark interactions with aquaculture installations do exist but are challenging to find. This extensive review summarises the state of knowledge of protected species interactions with marine fish and shellfish aquaculture installations. Although seaweed aquaculture was beyond the scope of this review, some of the findings for shellfish and finfish aquaculture may be relevant. The potential impacts of farms including habitat exclusion, entanglement, entrapment, collisions, and behavioural modifications are the primary risks posed to protected species by marine aquaculture facilities and operations. In addition, indirect effects from habitat impacts of farm operations may be of concern in some areas as well as the cumulative impacts of multiple small or large farms in the same general vicinity. Decades of farm innovations and best management practices have been driven by industry, natural resource managers, conservation organisations, and international conservation agreements. This review is useful for informing industry planning and permitting to develop aquaculture in the open ocean. This work will help advance the science of conservation by synthesising the state of knowledge and provide managers and industry with more insight to protect the most vulnerable species.</jats:p>

AB  - Understanding how salinity affects marine parasites is vital to understanding their ecology and treatment, particularly for host-parasite systems that traverse marine and freshwater realms such as the globally important Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) system. Growing concerns for wild fish populations, and decreased efficiencies and burgeoning costs of lice treatments for farmed fish has necessitated more environmentally and socially acceptable delousing procedures, such as hyposaline treatments. The effect of brackish water on L. salmonis following primary attachment is largely unknown, with experimental evidence derived mostly from unattached or newly attached copepodids, or adult stages. We aimed to understand how attached lice respond to hyposaline environments to assess effectiveness as a parasite management strategy and to help better define delousing areas used by wild fish. Louse development at 4, 12, 19 and 26 ppt, and survival at 4 ppt, decreased as exposure times increased, but survival was otherwise unaffected. Subjecting salmon to fluctuating, repeat exposures did not influence efficacy. We confirm that free-swimming stages are susceptible, and show that attached copepodids were more tolerant than previously predicted based on experiments on alternate development stages. These results improve our understanding of the utility of hyposaline treatments in aquaculture and self-treating in wild fish, and could apply to other fish-lice parasite systems. Further, these data are important for models predicting host-parasite interactions and can contribute to predictive models on the transmission dynamics of sea lice from farm to wild fish.

AB  - Within an increased global focus on the Blue Economy, seaweed has the potential to play a much larger role in the future of the UK food systems contributing to multiple environmental, economic, social and health benefits. Seaweed is currently used along the UK food chain as fertiliser, animal feed, in food processing, and as a low-carbon, nutrient dense food source. Mapping conducted using publicly available online sources identified 60 seaweed producers operating in the UK in 2021. These are predominantly small-scale harvesters and producers operating under a range of business models. However, with new enterprises entering the market involving larger scale industrial production and mechanised harvesting methods, the UK seaweed industry appears to be at the precipice of major changes. Scaling up the industry is seen as a priority for UK and devolved governments and an attractive sustainable investment option for venture capital. However, the potential impacts on the marine ecosystem and coastal livelihoods from an expected rapid expansion are currently unknown. In addition, regulation of the industry and the complex land and sea policy landscape is yet to be fully explored within the context of an expanded seaweed industry. Efforts have been expressed by government and industry bodies to ensure industry growth protects coastal communities and does not come at an environmental cost, but questions remain with regards to rapidly shifting power dynamics and industry pressures to deliver returns on investment in a global market. This paper will draw on examples from historical attempts to scale up seaweed production as well as other food-related industries to identify potential pitfalls for the industry to avoid if it is to find a path towards sustainable and responsible growth. More attention needs to be paid to the political economy of the seaweed industry, in particular the influence of powerful market actors and how this may impact the trajectory of the industry.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the impact of firm size and price variability on firm profitability in the Norwegian salmon farming industry using a panel data set of all companies from the period 2000 to 2014. Several proxies for firm size are included in the analysis. We find that firm’s share of total sales has a positive impact on profitability, while an alternative proxy, total assets, is negatively linked to profitability. Financial leverage (gearing) has a negative impact, but liquidity (current assets/current liabilities) is not found to significantly affect profitability. Operating efficiency indicators like working capital management (net working capital/total assets) and operating leverage (fixed assets/total assets) are positively associated with profitability. Finally, we find that salmon price variability increases profitability, and that smaller companies are more able to take advantage of the profit opportunities that price variability offer, compared to larger companies.

        <jats:p>This study introduces the Salmon Farming Potential Impact Index (SFPII) as a comprehensive framework for evaluating the magnitude and spatial extent of these impacts. SFPII integrates four social-ecological sensitivity factors and a pressure factor.
Our analysis, focusing on Southern Patagonia in Chile, reveals distinct spatial patterns within the SFPII values: i) a gradient from east to west, predominantly in the northern region, reflecting ecosystem sensitivity influenced by abiotic attributes, and ii) two areas of significantly higher SFPII scores, primarily attributed to the distribution of farming pressure. These high-score areas are interconnected by regions with low SFPII values, primarily influenced by maritime traffic linked to salmon farming operations.
The SFPII integration into sustainability frameworks ensures ongoing monitoring, allowing for adaptive management strategies to maintain aquaculture practices within acceptable ecological limits. Moreover, SFPII fosters transparency and stakeholder engagement, facilitating collaborative efforts towards sustainable salmon farming practices and the conservation of marine ecosystems.</jats:p>

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine early marine survival and movements of simulated escaped Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. pre-smolt and smolt from a commercial smolt farm during autumn. One-third of the pre-smolt most likely died in the immediate vicinity of the release location, whereas the corresponding mortality for smolts was lower (8.5%) during the 5-week study period. The surviving pre-smolt left the farm area after 2–3 days, predominantly along the shore. In contrast, most of the surviving smolts left the farm area during the first day and 54% seemed to move away from the shore and adopt a more pelagic movement pattern than pre-smolt. The number of surviving fish recorded in the fjord decreased throughout the study period, possibly due to a combination of fish migrating out of the fjord or undetected mortality. Compared with existing knowledge on migration of released farmed smolts during spring, our results indicate less directional and slower movement rates during autumn. Only two of the tagged fish were detected upstream in the rivers following release. A rapid dispersion of escapees indicates that the potential for recapturing escapees is limited unless recapture efforts are initiated immediately after escape. Hence, there is a need for development of technology that detects and prevents escapees to enter the sea.

AB  - Sea lice are a threat to the health of both wild and farmed salmon and an economic burden for salmon farms. With a free-living larval stage, sea lice can disperse tens of kilometres in the ocean between salmon farms, leading to connected sea louse populations that are difficult to control in isolation. In this paper, we develop a simple analytical model for the dispersal of sea lice (<i>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</i>) between two salmon farms. From the model, we calculate the arrival time distribution of sea lice dispersing between farms, as well as the level of cross-infection of sea lice. We also use numerical flows from a hydrodynamic model, coupled with a particle tracking model, to directly calculate the arrival time of sea lice dispersing between two farms in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, in order to fit our analytical model and find realistic parameter estimates. Using the parametrized analytical model, we show that there is often an intermediate interfarm spacing that maximizes the level of cross-infection between farms, and that increased temperatures will lead to increased levels of cross-infection.

AB  - Background and aims Fish by-products are generally used to produce fishmeal or fertilizers, with fish oil as a by-product. Despite their importance, fish wastes are still poorly explored and characterized and more studies are needed to reveal their potentiality. The goal of the present study was to qualitatively characterize and investigate the antimicrobial effects of the fish oil extracted from Salmo salar waste samples and to evaluate the potential use of these compounds for treating pathogen infections. Methods Salmo salar waste samples were divided in two groups: heads and soft tissues. Fatty acids composition, and in particular the content in saturated (SAFAs), mono-unsaturated (MUFAs) and Polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids, was characterized through GC/MS Thermo Focus GC-DSQ II equipped with a ZB-5 fused silica capillary tubes column. The antimicrobial activity of the salmon waste oils was evaluated through the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration assay and the antibiotics contamination was determined by Liquid Chromatography with tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. All experiments were done at least in triplicate. Results GC/MS analysis has shown the specific fatty acid composition of the salmon waste oils and their enrichment in MUFAs and PUFAs, with special reference to omega-3, -6, -7, -9 fatty acids. Furthermore, our study has highlighted the antimicrobial activity of the fish waste oil samples against two Gram+ and Gram- bacterial strains. Conclusions These data confirm that the fish waste is still quantitatively and qualitatively an important source of available biological properties that could be extracted and utilized representing an important strategy to counteract infective diseases in the context of the circular economy.

AB  - Today, fish farming creates significant impacts on water resources and food chain from a global perspective, as compared to those of the other agricultural activities. Some methods and chemicals heavily using production and consumption periods in fish farming are related to the environmental damages. Chemicals have a common usage in both the world and our country to protect the products from the negative effects of diseases. They are also imposed to increase the production. As Turkey has significant potential in fish farming in comparison to many other countries in the world, there is a wide use of antibiotics in production. This research examines the use of antibiotics in fish farming to shed light on the effects of chemicals on the production and human health.

AB  - Seven samples, each consisting of approximately 50 Atlantic salmon, were collected from five marine farms in Norway. These farms reported to rear fish originating from the same commercial breed; however, all samples followed a unique route of production from breeder to marine farm via egg, fry and smolt producers. A group of farmed escapees (n=50) were also captured. Following genotyping with 18 microsatellite loci, the global FST was 0.083, and pair-wise values were as high as 0.158. Four clusters, with varying degrees of genetic differentiation, were identified among samples from the farms, and the source of the escapees was identified successfully. It is suggested that the genetic differences observed among samples from the farms were created through the process of genetic drift, facilitated by parallel sub-strains, extensive within-strain selection and low to moderate numbers of adults contributing to batches of eggs. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that genetic identification of escaped Atlantic salmon, back to the farm of origin, may be possible even when farms rear fish reported to originate from a single breeder.

AB  - The sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi has become one of the main constraints for the sustainable development of salmon aquaculture in Chile. Although this parasite's negative impacts are well recognized by the industry, some novel potential threats remain unnoticed. The recent sequencing of the C. rogercresseyi genome revealed a large bacterial community associated with the sea louse, however, it is unknown if these microorganisms should become a new focus of sanitary concern. Herein, chromosome proximity ligation (Hi-C) coupled with long-read sequencing were used for the genomic reconstruction of the C. rogercresseyi microbiota. Through deconvolution analysis, we were able to assemble and characterize 413 bacterial genome clusters, including six bacterial genomes with more than 80% of completeness. The most represented bacterial genome belonged to the fish pathogen Tenacibacullum ovolyticum (97.87% completeness), followed by Dokdonia sp. (96.71% completeness). This completeness allowed identifying 21 virulence factors (VF) within the T. ovolyticum genome and four antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). Notably, genomic pathway reconstruction analysis suggests putative metabolic complementation mechanisms between C. rogercresseyi and its associated microbiota. Taken together, our data highlight the relevance of Hi-C techniques to discover pathogenic bacteria, VF, and ARGs and also suggest novel host-microbiota mutualism in sea lice biology.

AB  - The aquaculture sector is the fastest growing food production industry. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) can be a useful tool to assess its environmental impacts and ensure environmentally sustainable development. Years ago, critical reviews of LCA methodology have been conducted in that field to evaluate methodological practice. However, how effective were these reviews in improving LCA application? Are there any remaining issues that LCA practitioners should address in their practice? We tackle the above questions by critically reviewing all LCA cases applied to aquaculture and aquafeed production systems from a methodological point of view. A total of 65 studies were retrieved, thus tripling the scope of previous reviews. The studies were analysed following the main phases of the LCA methodology as described in the ISO standards, and the authors’ choices were extracted to identify potential trends in the LCA practice. We identified five main methodological issues, which still pose challenges to LCA practitioners: (i) the functional unit not always reflecting the actual function of the system, (ii) the system boundary often being too restricted, (iii) the multi-functionality of processes too often being handled with economic allocation while more recommendable ways exist, (iv) the impact coverage not covering all environmental impacts relevant to aquaculture and (v) the interpretation phase usually lacking critical discussion of the methodological limitations. We analysed these aspects in depth, highlighting trends and tendencies. For each of the five remaining issues, we provided recommendations to be integrated by practitioners in their future LCA practice. We also developed a brief research agenda to address the future needs of LCA in the aquaculture sector. The first need is that emphasis should be put on the construction of aquaculture life-cycle inventory databases with a special need for developing countries and for post-farming processes. Additionally, method developers should develop and/or refine characterisation models for missing impact pathways to better cover all relevant impacts of seafood farming.

AB  - Populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar can be restored and enhanced through planting of green or eyed eggs (embryos) in rivers and by releasing fry, parr, smolts, or postsmolts. The success of the releases varies with time and site of release, broodstock origin, size and age of the fish, and rearing and release techniques applied. However, egg, fry or parr releases cannot be used for augmenting populations above the carrying capacity of the water course. To surpass the carrying capacity, the fish should be released as smolts or postsmolts. Smolts released in rivers during spring migrate to sea for feeding but return to the river of release for spawning. Atlantic salmon released at the postsmolt stage may return to the release site when adult, but thereafter, they may stray to any of a number of rivers for spawning. As a result of ecological interactions, released juvenile hatchery fish may partly displace, increase the mortality, and decrease the growth rate, adult size, reproductive output, biomass, and production of wild conspecifics through density-dependent mechanisms work- ing in freshwater. Hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon are usually competitively inferior to wild conspecifics both during feeding and spawning in rivers, due to environmental impacts and genetic changes that occur during the juvenile rearing. Habitat restoration is preferred when restoring endangered, threatened, or weak populations. Degraded spawning habitats can be reconstructed, and poor freshwater quality can be mitigated. In regulated rivers, rapid fluc- tuations in water level should be avoided, and the migratory activity of the fish can be stimu- lated by increased water flow. Populations can also be enhanced by expanding the accessible nursery habitat by use of artificial fishways through human induced or natural migration hindrances. Adaptive management practice is useful when restoring and rehabilitating popu- lations and habitats. More knowledge is needed about environmental and genetic influences on the phenotype of hatchery fish and how habitats constrain salmon production in rivers.

AB  - Salmon farms are spatially concentrated reservoirs of fish host populations that can disrupt natural salmonid host-parasite dynamics. Sea lice frequently infect farm salmon and parasitize sympatric wild juvenile salmonids, with neg- ative impacts on survival in Europe and Pacific Canada. We examined louse parasitism of wild juvenile chum salmon (On- corhynchus keta) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from three salmon farming regions in British Columbia (Finlayson, Broughton Archipelago, and Georgia Strait). We compared sites of low and high exposure to farms and in- cluded an area without farms (Bella Bella) to assess baseline infection levels. Louse prevalence and abundance were low- est and most similar to natural baseline levels at low-exposure sites and highest at high-exposure sites in all farm regions. A significantly greater proportion of the lice were Lepeophtheirus salmonis at high-exposure sites. Exposure to salmon farms was the only consistently significant factor to explain the variation in prevalence data, with a secondary role played by salinity. Our results support the hypothesis that salmon farms are a major source of sea lice on juvenile wild salmon in salmon farming regions and underscore the importance of using management techniques that mitigate threats to wild stocks. Resume´ : Les elevages de saumons sont des reservoirs concentres dans l'espace de populations de poissons hotes qui peu- vent perturber la dynamique naturelle des saumons hotes et de leurs parasites. Les puces de mer infectent frequemment les saumons d'elevage et parasitent les jeunes salmonides sauvages sympatriques, ce qui a des impacts negatifs sur la survie en Europe et la region pacifique du Canada. Nous avons etudiele parasitisme par les puces de mer chez les saumons keta (Oncorhynchus keta) et roses (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) dans trois regions d'elevage de saumons en Colombie- Britannique (Finlayson, archipel de Broughton et detroit de Georgie). Nous avons compareles sites fortement et faiblement exposes aux elevages, ainsi qu'une region sans elevages (Bella Bella), afin d'evaluer les niveaux d'infection de base. La prevalence et l'abondance des puces de mer sont minimales et le plus semblables aux niveaux de base naturels aux sites de faible exposition, et maximales aux sites de forte exposition dans toutes les regions d'elevage. Aux sites de forte expo- sition, une proportion significativement plus elevee des puces de mer appartient al'espece Lepeophtheirus salmonis. L'ex- position aux elevages de saumons est le seul facteur explicatif constamment significatif dans les donnees de prevalence avec la salinitequi joue un role secondaire. Nos resultats appuient l'hypothese selon laquelle les elevages de saumons sont une source importante de puces de mer pour les jeunes saumons sauvages dans les regions d'elevage de saumons et ils soulignent l'importance d'utiliser des techniques de gestion qui reduisent les menaces aux stocks sauvages.

AB  - Abstract The short-term relationships between the supply of farmed salmon and its market and biological determinants are not fully understood. In this article an econometric model of salmon supply is estimated exploiting monthly data on Norwegian salmon aquaculture. Our estimates indicate that supply has shifted over time due to innovations in several areas. We find that the price of farmed salmon has a limited effect on supplied quantity, giving a highly inelastic short-run supply elasticity. The biomass and seasonal factors are the main determinants of shifts in salmon supply in the short term. JEL Classification Codes: D22, Q11, Q22

AB  - O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da utilizacao de diferentes manejos alimentares: alimento natural, racao peletizada, extrusada ou farelada, sobre a qualidade da agua dos efluentes gerados em uma criacao de tilapia do Nilo (Oreochromis niloticus). O experimento foi desenvolvido durante 19 semanas em doze viveiros de 300 m2, com renovacao continua de agua, povoados com juvenis machos de tilapia do Nilo na densidade de 1,7 peixes m-2. As racoes isoproteicas (30% de proteina bruta) e isoenergeticas (3.000kcal de energia digestivel) foram fornecidas duas vezes ao dia. Quanto ao tratamento alimento natural, foi utilizado esterco de galinha poedeira. Semanalmente, foram aferidos na agua de abastecimento e nos efluentes, temperatura, oxigenio dissolvido, pH, fosforo total, nitrogenio total, clorofila a e material em suspensao. De maneira geral, houve piora na qualidade da agua dos efluentes de todos os tratamentos estudados, em comparacao a agua de abastecimento, evidenciando o impacto ambiental desta atividade produtiva, podendo levar a eutrofizacao dos corpos d'agua receptores.

AB  - Since the 1980s, fish farming (aquaculture) has been an important contributor to Scotland's economy, but there are concerns that nutrient-rich food waste and excreta from these farms are causing eutrophication. Water quality monitoring preceding the arrival and subsequent expansion of the industry is limited. Therefore, to better understand the impacts of in-lake fish farms on the quality of freshwater ecosystems, we examined the diatom records in sediment cores from seven freshwater lochs in Scotland over a timescale of c.100-200 years, spanning the period before and after installation of the fish cages at these sites. At three lochs (A, C, E) we observed marked diatom assemblage shifts indicative of eutrophication, coincident with arrival of the fish farms, at two lochs (B, G) there was evidence of enrichment over a longer timescale although with some further enrichment occurring with the advent of the fish farms, and at the other two lochs (D, F), diatom shifts were subtle and showed no sign of eutrophication. Thus, while marked ecological shifts are shown to occur with the arrival of fish farms in some sites, this is not always the case. The natural background conditions, the scale of operations, the siting of the fish cages in relation to location of inflows and outflows, the role of flushing rate and additional sources of nutrients are discussed as potential factors for the variable impacts observed across the seven lochs. Such factors should be considered when planning future installation and expansion of fish farms to ensure sustainable development of these resources. Our study provides an understanding of baseline conditions and long-term water quality trajectories in freshwater lakes with fish farms and demonstrates the value of paleolimnology in supporting management decisions with respect to fisheries.

AB  - Reduction of Lepeophtheirus salmonis infection in Atlantic salmon achieved by glucosinolates (GLs) from Brassica plants was recently reported. However, wider application of functional feeds based on GLs requires better knowledge of their positive and adverse effects. Liver, distal kidney and muscle transcriptomes of salmon exposed to the extreme dose of GLs were profiled by microarray, while qPCR analysis followed up selected hepatic and renal responses under the extreme and moderate GLs dose during the L. salmonis challenge. Transcriptional analysis were complemented with measurements of organ indices, liver steatosis and plasma profiling, including indicators of cytolysis and bilirubin. Finally, the third trial was performed to quantify the effect of lower GLs doses on growth. The extreme GLs dose caused a decrease in hepatic fat deposition and growth, in line with microarray findings, which suggested tissue remodeling and reduction of cellular proliferation in the skeletal muscle and liver. Lower GLs inclusion levels in a follow-up trial did not show negative effects on growth. Microarray analysis of the distal kidney pointed to activation of anti-fibrotic responses under the overexposure. However, analyses of ALT, CK and AST enzymes in plasma provided no evidence of increased cytolysis and organ damage. Prevalent activation of phase-2 detoxification genes that occurred in all three tissues could be considered part of beneficial effects caused by the extreme dose of GLs. In addition, transcriptomic evidence suggested GLs-mediated iron and heme withdrawal response, including increased heme degradation in muscle (upregulation of heme oxygenase-1), decrease of its synthesis in liver (downregulation of porphobilinogen deaminase) and increased iron sequestration from blood (hepatic induction of hepcidin-1 and renal induction of intracellular storage protein ferritin). This response could be advantageous for salmon upon encountering lice, which depend on the host for the provision of iron carrying heme. Most of the hepatic genes studied by qPCR showed similar expression levels in fish exposed to GLs, lice and their combination, while renal induction of leptin suggested heightened stress by the combination of extreme dose of GLs and lice. High expression of interferon γ (cytokine considered organ-protective in mammalian kidney) was detected at the moderate GLs level. This fish also showed highest plasma bilirubin levels (degradation product of heme), and had lowest number of attached lice, further supporting hypothesis that making heme unavailable to lice could be part of an effective anti-parasitic strategy. Modulation of detoxification and iron metabolism in Atlantic salmon tissues could be beneficial prior and during lice infestations. Investigation of anti-lice functional feeds based on low and moderate GLs inclusion levels thus deserves further attention.

AB  - The aquaculture industry has experienced substantial growth for many years. Moreover, high growth rates are projected to continue into the foreseeable future. Compared to other aquaculture species, salmon farming is one of the most capital-intensive seafood industries, requiring substantial investments in working capital, fixed assets, intangible assets (i.e., licenses), and innovation. Meanwhile, this industry is exposed to both production risk and demand uncertainty. Surprisingly, investment behavior in the salmon farming sector has attracted very little research. In this study, we examine how investments in the Norwegian aquaculture sector are affected by macroeconomic and industry-specific uncertainty, cash flows, and leverage. In line with studies in other sectors, we find that cash flows are a significant determinant of investment behavior. However, our results on the relationship between uncertainty and capital formation contrast similar studies on natural resource-based industries.

AB  - The recent development of molecular genetic markers and methods of inferring relatedness among individuals using multilocus genotype information has allowed new insight into mating systems in the wild. Capitalising on the recently discovered linkage between the microsatellite locus Ssa202 and the sex-determining region of the Atlantic salmon Y chromosome, we developed a novel method to infer the sex of unsampled, wild-spawning parents of some of the few remaining wild, inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We inferred that most of the unsampled, reconstructed parents at the half-sib group level were likely polygamous females, while the parents at the full-sib group level (nested within half-sib groups) were likely monogamous males. Given the very low numbers of anadromous salmon returning to inner Bay of Fundy rivers to spawn, the putative male parents were likely mature male parr rather than anadromous males. This suggests that salmonid populations experiencing extreme declines may be compose...

AB  - The influence of time of escape on survival to adulthood was tested in farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolt and post-smolts. Escape events were simulated in a small fjord in western Norway during and after the natural period of smolt migration by releasing 6 groups of individually tagged smolts and post-smolts (~2000 fish in each group) every second week from 27 May to 5 August 2005. With the exception of a lower return rate of the first released group (0.31%), the recapture rates were very similar (0.85 to 1.05%) and did not vary significantly with time of release. Of the 100 recap- tures, 57% were 1-sea-winter (1SW) salmon, 25% were 2SW and 18% returned as 3SW salmon. Release date did not influence the sea age but affected the weights of the recaptured adults moder- ately. Fifty-four percent of the fish were recaptured in the vicinity of the release site, most of them in the freshwater effluent from a hydropower plant. The rest were spread along the coast of Norway and in rivers (26% of the distant recaptures) over distances of 100s of kilometres. The present study shows that farmed salmon escaped during their first summer in sea cages — after the natural time for smolt migration in spring — are still capable of adopting the marine migratory pattern of their wild con- specifics. This suggests that escapes at this time of the year are a hazard to the conservation of wild salmon populations.

AB  - Families (35) of Atlantic salmon were duplicated in 70 tanks and entered into a feed efficiency trial. Cumulative Feed intake (FI), weight gain (WTGAIN), feed efficiency (FE) and final energy content of the fish (ENERGY), which depends on its lipid content, were recorded at tank level and analysed at the family level using ~55000 SNP markers. To the best of our knowledge, genomic analysis of feed efficiency traits at the family level have not been estimated before, highlighting new possibilities for analysing family level group data with genomics. Results showed medium-high heritability for the four traits. ENERGY, which is a direct effect of body lipid content, was negatively correlated to FE (r=-0.60), showing its potential as a selection criterion for feed efficiency. As expected, the genetic correlation between WTGAIN and FI was extremely high in this dataset, which indicates that gross WTGAIN is a very good predictor of FI.

AB  - Recently, the prevalence of <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> antibiotic-resistant strains has been reported in aquaculture, but its intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms are largely unknown. In the present study, a label-free proteomics technology was used to compare the differential protein abundances in response to norfloxacin (NOR) stress in <i>A. hydrophila</i>. The results showed that there were 186 proteins decreasing and 220 proteins increasing abundances in response to NOR stress. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins were enriched in several biological processes, such as sulfur metabolism and homologous recombination. Furthermore, the antibiotic sensitivity assays showed that the deletion of <i>AHA_0904</i>, <i>cirA</i>, and <i>cysI</i> significantly decreased the resistance against NOR, whereas Δ<i>AHA_1239</i>, <i>ΔcysA</i>, Δ<i>cysD</i>, and Δ<i>cysN</i> significantly increased the resistance against NOR. Our results provide insights into NOR resistance mechanisms and indicate that <i>AHA_0904</i>, <i>cirA</i>, <i>AHA_1239</i>, and sulfur metabolism may play important roles in NOR resistance in <i>A. hydrophila</i>.

AB  - Abstract In Norway, the world's largest salmon-producing country, reducing sea-lice levels in fish farms has been an overarching goal of government policy since 2013. However, industry innovation has not yet succeeded in significantly reducing the sea lice problem. We identify two main types of radical environmental innovation that could potentially resolve the sea-lice problem: in-shore closed-cage production technology, and a genetically lice-resistant salmon. Furthermore, we provide an analytical framework that shows how radical environmental innovations with a “public good” character are least likely to receive private R&D funds. This leads us to conclude that neither in-shore closed cage technology nor targeted breeding towards lice-resistance will succeed in the market unless backed by targeted government intervention. Closer examination shows that these two types of innovation have been less prioritized, if at all, in recent policy interventions. First, the government has geared most of financial support towards relieving the risk of investment in offshore innovation projects, although inshore projects might be better suited for accommodating public and environmental needs. Second, this study underscores the need and potential for stimulating sustainable innovation through the genetic route—a point overlooked in Norway's current policy mix.

AB  - Abstract Lice is a persistent and major problem in the salmon aquaculture sector with serious environmental impacts and reducing growth potential and income of the salmon industry. This article discusses whether there is an untapped potential in breeding for improved lice resistant of Atlantic salmon. To this end, three sets of factors that may impact the state of breeding for lice resistance are examined, using document analysis and key actor interviews. First, our data material indicates that market-based factors will hardly stimulate this type of breeding, as the benefits from breeding for lice resistance is predominantly a public good, and because the polygenic nature of lice resistance does not enable patenting as a powerful instrument to secure private goods or privatize the benefits of genetic improvement. Second, the regulation of gene editing technologies is in flux, and increase the risk of investments in technologies as selective breeding that could handle the polygenic challenges of lice resistance. Finally, policy instruments aimed at stimulating relevant innovation has been applied generously for other types of innovations to deal with the lice problem. For instance, new technologies for delousing have resulted in increased treatments and caused higher stress and mortality the recent years. However, none of these have targeted major root causes of the salmon lice problem (e.g. big monocultures or susceptible fish) or been exploited by breeding actors. Seen from a social and environmental point of view this could paradoxically lead to increased demand for fish that better endures harsh delousing treatments rather than demand for more lice resistant fish.

AB  - By-products and mortalities from aquaculture have often posed significant challenges to the industry because of their low value resulting in high costs and environmental impact from their disposal. However increasing interest is being expressed in their utilisation to add value to the aquaculture industry and provide synergies with industries which had previously been in competition with aquaculture.
Current and prospective processing by-product and farm mortality utilisation strategies were reviewed along with regulations and standards which aim to control their use and protect against human and animal health hazards.
The role of aquaculture and fishery by-products in the supply of fishmeal was investigated and it was found that both sectors had the potential to contribute to increasing global supply. There were significant quantities of processing by-products identified which could be directed to fishmeal manufacture but there were also significant amounts of fish production which were not being processed in some regions and could also add to supplies. Processing by-products from aquaculture species often exceed 50% of the production by mass and therefore their efficient utilisation is of significant importance to the overall performance of the value chain. Their utilisation strategies are diverse and in some circumstances offer the possibility to add significant value. 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is increasingly being used to inform decision makers and consumers about the environmental performance of goods and services to make choices on best practices and informative decisions on purchasing choices. Current methodology in LCA was critiqued and developed to be used for identifying disproportionate impacts from by-product industries and comparative assessment of the eco-efficiency of value chains from Thai shrimp, Vietnamese Pangasius catfish and Scottish salmon aquaculture. New LCA methodology was developed assessing the eco-efficiency of co-products as a whole and in relation to a tonne of edible yield. Measuring the impact of the by-product industry in relation to their edible yield gave different results to measuring their eco-efficiency between the three study species. It was found that the Thai shrimp value chain was the most eco-efficient when by-products were directed to chitosan and hydrolysate manufacture, but production of the salmon was the least impacting between the species in terms of edible yield. Pangasius was the most environmentally impacting of the three species value chains using both methods. It was also found that the upstream impacts of fish and shrimp production, especially feed manufacture, contributed most to the environmental impact in most circumstances, using both economic and mass allocation. Although the methodology produced interesting results, there were some drawbacks and the data sets also had several gaps which led to some assumptions, which could have skewed the results and interpretation.

AB  - <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Mycotoxins, originating from contaminated raw materials or suboptimal feed storage, are a growing concern in tropical aquaculture. Common fungi such as <jats:italic>Aspergillus</jats:italic> spp. and <jats:italic>Fusarium</jats:italic> spp. produce mycotoxins including aflatoxin, fumonisin, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone. High doses or prolonged exposure (weeks) to low doses of these mycotoxins (&lt; 20 μg/kg) can depress growth, immunity, and cause mortality. This study investigated poor growth and low survival in juvenile Asian seabass, <jats:italic>Lates calcarifer</jats:italic> fed two different diets (FM40 and ABS3) for 5 weeks. Analysis of these diets revealed high peroxide values, multiple mycotoxins and high histamine levels. Fish fed the FM40 diet, which was contaminated with aflatoxin B1 (13.2 μg/kg), aflatoxin B2 (1.9 μg/kg), deoxynivalenol (29.5 μg/kg), alternariol (2.2 μg/kg), elevated peroxide value (45.91 mEq/kg), and histamine (129.51 mg/kg) developed mild bile duct hyperplasia, depressed total serum proteins (50.40 ± 10.06 g/L), markedly elevated blood potassium (8.2 ± 0.18 mmol/L), and heavy iron deposits in splenic melanomacrophage centres (Perl's stain) indicative of increased haemolysis. The presence of multiple cytotoxic mycotoxins in FM40 diet could explain the increased haemolysis and elevated blood potassium. In contrast, fish fed the ABS3 diet, which had high histamine levels (210.05 mg/kg), exhibited protein‐losing nephropathy with multifocal fibrin plugs (Martius scarlet blue stain) indicating acute renal damage, and elevated blood calcium and phosphorus levels. Histamine is metabolised and excreted through the kidneys and known to induce renal arteriolar constriction, disrupt glomerular filtration barrier and increase permeability resulting in protein loss. This study shows that blood biochemistry and histopathology are useful diagnostic tools for assessing the impact of mycotoxins and histamines on fish health.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Choosing a technological progress bias that matches the factor endowment structure is significant for optimizing resource allocation and improving productivity. Therefore, in this study, a data envelopment analysis method is applied to calculate the input‐biased technological progress index of China's mariculture industry from 2006 to 2018, measure the bias of technological progress, and analyze its desirability. The results indicate the following: first, there is input‐biased technological progress in various regions and its contribution to the total factor productivity (TFP) in most regions is positive. Second, there are differences in the bias of technological progress during the sample period; that is, the technological progress between capital and labor, capital and mariculture area, and labor and mariculture area, is steadily biased toward using capital and saving labor, is mostly biased toward using capital and saving mariculture area, and is relatively biased toward using mariculture area and saving labor, respectively. Third, the results support constructing factor endowment indicators to analyze the desirability of technological progress bias and discover technological mismatch. Based on the research results, this study presents relevant policy recommendations to promote the scientific development of China's mariculture industry.</jats:p>

AB  - A large-scale escape experiment using 1031 adult Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. was performed in the Hardangerfjord in western Norway to study the dispersal of escaped salmon, eval- uate the effect of a gill-net fishery targeting escaped salmonids and test whether surface trawling is an effective way of recapturing escaped salmon in a large fjord system. The salmon of mean weights 1.56 and 5.5 kg were released from 2 commercial fish farms in late September 2006. All fish were tagged with external tags, and 48 were also equipped with acoustic transmitters. A surface pair-trawl (50 m wide and 8 m deep) was constructed to optimize catchability and maneuverability in the fjord environment. Trawling was unsuccessful, and caught only 6 simulated escapees. Telemetry data con- firmed that the fish were available along the towing tracks, and we assume that towing speed and/or trawl size may have been suboptimal with regard to avoidance by fish in the fjord environment. Gill- netting proved to be an efficient method of recapture. The total reported recapture rate (of 114 fish- ers) was 40%, but a significantly higher recapture rate (67%) of the more highly rewarded acoustic transmitters, and the distribution of the fish in time and space, suggest that the actual catch may have been substantially higher. Approximately 90% of the catches were taken within 40 km of the release sites over the course of 4 wk. We conclude that a significant proportion of escaped adult salmon can be recaptured if the catch effort within the fjord basin is widespread and lasts for at least 4 wk.

AB  - This chapter starts by spelling out different ways of answering the question “why does an animal behave in this way?”, often referred to as Tinbergen’s four question (Tinbergen, N., The study of instinct. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1951). These are: what causes the behaviour? How does it develop? What are its consequences for fitness? and Through what stages did it evolve? Examples of answers to these different questions are given in relation to the behaviour of wild fish, looking at: use of space; foraging and feeding; avoiding predators; aggression and fighting and courtship. Farmed fish are relatively little domestication compared to farmed terrestrial species and they bring with them to the fish farm many of the behavioural characteristics of farmed fish; this is discussed in the context of each of the broad behavioural systems mentioned above. Problems for the welfare of farmed fish arising from expression of the natural behaviour of the fish concerned are discussed and behaviourally-based solutions suggested.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from natural sources represent promising candidates for novel antimicrobial agents instead of antibiotics in aquaculture. Moricin, a family of AMPs from Lepidoptera, has shown bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, it remains uncertain whether these peptides possess antimicrobial activity against Vibrio pathogens affecting various aquatic animals, including sea cucumbers. In this study, we investigated five moricin-like peptides (MLPs) from Antheraea pernyi (Anpe) and identified Anpe-MLP1 as a new member of the moricin family through bioinformatics analysis. Anpe-MLP1 was heterologously expressed using the AnpeNPV bacmid system and purified from A. pernyi pupae. Our findings revealed that recombinant Anpe-MLP1 (rAnpe-MLP1) exhibited antimicrobial activity against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ATCC 6538 P), gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli ATCC 25922) and three Vibrio species. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo assays showed that rAnpe-MLP1 effectively inhibited wild-type Vibrio fluvialis infections in the sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus). These results suggest that Anpe-MLP1 holds great potential as a novel anti-infective agent and provide valuable insights for its future application in aquaculture.

AB  - <jats:p>The ability to differentiate between various fish species plays an essential role in aquaculture. It helps to protect their populations and monitor their health situations and their nutrient systems. However, old machine learning methods are unable to detect objects in images with complex backgrounds and especially in low-light conditions. This paper aims to improve the performance of a YOLO v5 model for fish recognition and classification. In the context of transfer learning, our improved model FishDETECT uses the pre-trained FishMask model. Then it is tested in various complex scenes. The experimental results show that FishDETECT is more effective than a simple YOLO v5 model. Using the evaluation metrics Precision, Recall, and mAP50, our new model achieved accuracy rates of 0.962, 0.978, and 0.995, respectively.</jats:p>

AB  - Drug behavior in the bodies of fish is largely influenced by the water temperature. Antimicrobial drugs are needed for the control of bacterial outbreaks in farmed fish including Asian seabass (<i>Lates calcarifer</i>). However, little is known about the temperature effect on appropriate drug uses in this species. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in pharmacokinetics (PK), optimal dosages, tissue depletion, and withdrawal time (WDT) of florfenicol (FF) in Asian seabass reared at 25 and 30 °C. In the PK study, the fish were administered with a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg FF. The optimal dosing regimen was determined by the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) approach. In the tissue depletion and WDT study, FF was administered at the optimal dosages once daily for 5 days and the WDT was determined by linear regression analysis based on the sum of FF and its metabolite florfenicol amine (FFA) in the muscle/skin. When the temperature was increased from 25 to 30 °C, the elimination half-life of FF was significantly decreased from 11.0 to 7.2 h. While the other PK parameters were not changed significantly, the calculated optimal dosages for the target minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 µg/mL were 10.9 and 22.0 mg/kg/day, respectively for 25 and 30 °C. The sum of FF + FFA is a preferable marker residue for WDT determination because differential FF metabolism was observed at different temperatures. The depletion half-life of the muscle/skin was shortened from 41.1 to 32.4 h by the 5 °C temperature increase. Despite different absolute amounts of FF given between the two temperature levels, the WDTs were very similar at 6-7 days. Thus, it appears that a single temperature-independent WDT can potentially be assigned when the drug was applied at the optimal dosage.

AB  - <jats:p>In times of rapid change and rising human pressures on marine systems, information about the future state of the ocean can provide decision-makers with time to avoid adverse impacts and maximise opportunities. An ecological forecast predicts changes in ecosystems and its components due to environmental forcing such as climate variability and change, extreme weather conditions, pollution, or habitat change. Here, we summarise examples from several sectors and a range of locations. We describe the need, approach, forecast performance, delivery system, and end user uptake. This examination shows that near-term ecological forecasts are needed by end users, decisions are being made based on forecasts, and there is an urgent need to develop operational information systems to support sustainable ocean management. An operational information system is critical for connecting to decision makers and providing an enduring approach to forecasting and proactive decision making. These operational systems require significant investment and ongoing maintenance but are key to delivering ecological forecasts for societal benefits. Iterative forecasting practices could provide continuous improvement by incorporating evaluation and feedback to overcome the limitations of the imperfect model and incomplete observations to achieve better forecast outcomes and accuracy.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Infectious disease from domestic hosts, held for agriculture, can impact wild species that migrate in close proximity, potentially reversing selective advantages afforded by migration. For sockeye salmon in British Columbia, Canada, juveniles migrate past numerous Atlantic salmon farms from which they may acquire a number of infectious agents. We analyse patterns of molecular detection in juvenile sockeye salmon for one bacterial pathogen, Tenacibaculum maritimum, known to cause disease in fish species around the globe and to cause mouthrot disease in farmed Atlantic salmon in BC. Our data show a clear peak in T. maritimum detections in the Discovery Islands region of BC, where sockeye migrate close to salmon farms. Using well established differential-equation models to describe sockeye migration and T. maritimum infection spread, we fit models to our detection data to assess support for multiple hypotheses describing farm- and background-origin infection. Despite a data-constrained inability to resolve certain epidemiological features of the system, such as the relative roles of post infection mortality and recovery, our models clearly support the role of Discovery-Islands salmon farms in producing the observed patterns. Our best models (with 99.8% empirical model support) describe relatively constant (background) infection pressure, except around Discovery-Islands salmon farms, where farm-origin infection pressure peaked at 12.7 (approximate 95% CI: 4.5 to 31) times background levels. Given the evidence for farm-origin transfer of T. maritimum to Fraser-River sockeye salmon, the severity of associated disease in related species, and the imperilled nature of Fraser River sockeye generally, our results suggest the need for a more precautionary approach to managing farm/wild interactions in sockeye salmon.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis article addresses the issue of credit risk in the salmon industry. During the period 2000–2002 the Norwegian salmon industry witnessed a period of low prices leading to a wave of defaults and bankruptcies. The consequences were large monetary losses for both investors and banks, highlighting the importance of early detection of failing firms. Using financial ratios measuring the firms’ financial status prior to this event, two credit risk models are developed; one using logit regression and the other Classification and Regression trees. The performance of the two models developed is compared to a cross-industry benchmark model developed by the Norwegian Central Bank. The model estimated on industry data is better at separating between companies with high and low credit risk in the salmon industry compared to the benchmark model.

AB  - The progressive expansion of aquaculture practices led to the development of bacterial disease outbreaks, otherwise the continuous and extensive use of antibiotics to overcome these diseases. Vibrio and Aeromonas species are responsible for the most severe losses affecting the aquaculture industry in Egypt. The objective of our study to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of Vibrio parahemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila species isolated from Nile tilapia and Mugil fish farms in Kafr El-Sheikh province, Egypt, and molecular detection of antibiotic resistance genes. A total of 305 samples were gathered from apparently path-genomic lesions in different organs from 100 diseased fishes, 65 isolates of Vibrio species were isolated and V. parahemolyticus was isolated with an incidence of 55.4%. Out of 100 examined fish samples 72 Aeromonas species were isolated, A. hydrophila was isolated with an incidence of 99.3 %. Vibrio parahemolyticus showed high resistance for amoxicillin and colistin followed by cefotaxime and streptomycin. Meanwhile, Aeromonas hydrophila were highly resistant to amoxicillin and tetracycline followed by streptomycin, cefotaxime, and colistin. Five isolates of V. Parahemolyticus and A. hydrophila were screened using PCR for detection of 4 antibiotic resistance genes β-lactamase resistance gene (blaTEM); aminoglycosides (aadA1); tetracycline-resistant A tetA (A) and polymyxin resistance (mcr1) which were distinguished in all five V. parahaemolyticus and A. hydrophila isolates. The high detection of V. parahaemolyticus and A. hydrophila antibiotic resistance genes in our study could pose a potential risk to public health so, control methods should be taken to prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Yersinia ruckeri causes outbreaks of enteric redmouth disease in salmon aquaculture all over the world. The transient antibiotic tolerance exhibited by bacterial persisters is commonly thought to be responsible for outbreaks; however, the molecular factors underlying this behavior have not been explored in Y. ruckeri. In this study, we investigated the participation of the RNA chaperone Hfq from Y. ruckeri in antibiotic persistence. Cultures of the hfq-knockout mutant (Δhfq) exhibited faster replication, increased ATP levels and a more reductive environment than the wild type. The growth curves of bacteria exposed to sublethal concentrations of ampicillin, oxolinic acid, ciprofloxacin and polymyxin B revealed a greater susceptibility for the Δhfq strain. The time-kill curves of bacteria treated with the antibiotics mentioned above and florfenicol, using inoculums from exponential, stationary and biofilm cultures, demonstrated that the Δhfq strain has significant defects in persister cells production. To shed more light on the role of Hfq in antibiotic persistence, we analyzed its dependence on the (p)ppGpp synthetase RelA by determining the persister cells production in the absence of the relA gene. The ΔrelA and ΔrelAΔhfq strains displayed similar defects in persister cells formation, but higher than Δhfq strain. Similarly, stationary cultures of the ΔrelA and ΔrelAΔhfq strains exhibited comparable levels of ATP but higher than that of the Δhfq strain, indicating that relA is epistatic over hfq. Taken together, our findings provide valuable information on antibiotic persistence in Y. ruckeri, shedding light on the participation of Hfq in the persistence phenomenon.

AB  - Seafood has an important role to play to achieve a sustainable food system that provides healthy food to a growing world population. Future seafood production will be increasingly reliant on aquaculture where feed innovation is essential to reduce environmental impacts and minimize feed and food competition. This study aimed to investigate whether a novel single cell protein feed ingredient based on Paecilomyces variotii grown on a side stream from the forest industry could improve environmental sustainability of farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by replacing the soy protein concentrate used today. A Life Cycle Assessment including commonly addressed impacts but also the rarely assessed biodiversity impacts was performed. Furthermore, feeding trials were included for potential effects on fish growth, i.e., an assessment of the environmental impacts for the functional unit 'kg feed required to produce 1 kg live-weight rainbow trout'. Results showed that the best experimental diet containing P. variotii performed 16-73 % better than the control diet containing soy protein concentrate in all impact categories except for energy demand (21 % higher impact). The largest environmental benefits from replacing soy protein with P. variotii in rainbow trout diets was a 73 % reduction of impact on biodiversity and halved greenhouse gas emissions. The findings have high relevance for the aquaculture industry as the production scale and feed composition was comparable to commercial operations and because the effect on fish growth from inclusion of the novel ingredient in a complete diet was evaluated. The results on biodiversity loss from land use change and exploitation through fishing suggest that fishery can dominate impacts and exclusion thereof can greatly underestimate biodiversity impact. Finally, a novel feed ingredient grown on side streams from the forest industry has potential to add to food security through decreasing the dependence on increasingly scarce agricultural land resources.

AB  - This paper examines the export promotion of processed foods by a regional economy and regional vitalisation policy. We employ Bertrand models that contain a major home producer and a home producer in a local area. In our model, growth in the profit of one producer does not result in an increase in the profit of the other, despite strategic complements. We show that the profit of the producer in the local area decreases because of the deterioration of a location condition, and its profit increases through the reinforcement of the administrative guidance. Furthermore, when the inefficiency of the location worsens, the local government should optimally decrease the level of administrative guidance. Hence, the local government should strategically eliminate this inefficiency to maintain a sufficient effect of administrative guidance.

AB  - ABSTRACT The US egg industry has evolved considerably over recent decades by incorporating new technologies and production practices. To date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the resource demand and environmental effects of these changes. This study quantifies the environmental footprint of egg production supply chains in the United States for 2010 compared with 1960 using life cycle assessment. The analysis considers changes in both foreground (e.g., hen production performance) and background (e.g., efficiencies of energy provision, fertilizer production, production of feed inputs, and transport modes) system variables. The results revealed that feed efficiency, feed composition, and manure management are the 3 primary factors that determine the environmental impacts of US egg production. Further research and improvements in these areas will aid in continual reduction of the environmental footprint of the US egg industry over time. Per kilogram of eggs produced, the environmental footprint for 2010 is 65% lower in acidifying emissions, 71% lower in eutrophying emissions, 71% lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and 31% lower in cumulative energy demand compared with 1960. Table egg production was 30% higher in 2010; however, the total environmental footprint was 54% lower in acidifying emissions, 63% lower in eutrophying emissions, 63% lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and 13% lower in cumulative energy demand compared with 1960. Reductions in the environmental footprint over the 50-yr interval considered can be attributed to the following: 27 to 30% due to improved efficiencies of background systems, which outweighed the declining energy return on energy invested for primary energy sources; 30 to 44% due to changes in feed composition; and 28 to 43% due to improved bird performance.

AB  - Social unrest is on the rise worldwide amid deepening inequalities, environmental degradation, and job crises worsened by increasing social-environmental conflicts. In Chile, a social revolt in 2019 resulted in a national referendum in 2020. An ample majority (78.3% vs. 21.7%) voted to draft a new constitution to replace the current constitution drawn up under dictatorship. The result led to the emergence and empowerment of several organizations demanding an “ecological constitution”. In this context, we aim to analyze: (1) the main social-environmental conflicts in Chile and how they are related to the country’s current constitution, and (2) the potential drafting of an ecological constitution that addresses these conflicts. Across different industries in Chile, we observed common problems that are intrinsically related to the current constitution. This relationship seems to be perceived by Chilean citizens since a survey carried out in May 2021 found 79% support for an ecological constitution. Moreover, 105 of the 155 delegates to the constitutional convention proposed three or more environmental principles to be included in the new constitution. A potential ecological constitution entails principles that would improve the current situation of social-environmental conflicts in Chile. Based on our analysis, we recommend the establishment of watershed-based “territorial rights” in the new Chilean constitution to improve sustainability and environmental justice.

AB  - Impacts of salmon lice is a major concern for a sustainable production of farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway. Most treatment methods for removal of salmon lice have associated increased mortality and decreased growth in a period after delousing, which affects the profitability of the farmer, and causes poor welfare and sustainability. In addition, the variance in mortality and growth, especially after non-medicinal treatment methods, is high, which makes it hard for a farmer to decide which control measure to apply to keep lice levels below the legal limit. In this study, we have applied a stochastic partial budget approach to assess the economic impact of reducing mortality and increasing growth of farmed Atlantic salmon by preventing, replacing and improving current delousing methods in Norway. We have simulated a production cycle of two different smolt-groups to find the outcome (harvested biomass, average end weight of the salmon, number of dead fish and feed consumption) of production cycles without or with two, three or four delousing treatments in the on-growing phase at sea. The results suggest that accounting for the biological losses associated with lice treatments is important when making choices of delousing strategies. The biological costs of increased mortality and decreased growth associated with especially non-medicinal treatments are expected to be high, but varies substantially. Therefore, the economic benefit of preventing or improving can also be high. The calculations imply that salmon producers could invest a considerable amount in measures for prevention or improvement of thermal treatments before break-even. For example could a farmer use on average 535,313 €/cage/ 1-yearling production in measure to prevent four thermal treatments before it is no longer economical beneficial. Depending on the performance of the four thermal treatments a farmer could use from 319,196-737,934 €/cage/ 1-yearling production on measures of improvement. Replacing one thermal treatment with another immediate treatment method has a minor economic benefit. The results further shows that sales value and feed consumption constitutes the largest share of the change in profit between different treatment regimes. The results from this study also show that not taking into account the risk of mortality and reduced growth associated with the different treatment methods of delousing, could lead to underestimating the benefit of improving, preventing and replacing treatments.

AB  - Abstract Sustained growth of world-wide sea farming and the search of optimal growing conditions have driven several countries, including Norway, to establish new finfish sites in more exposed, high current locations. Characterized by a range of gravel, broken rock and/or bedrock, these complex environments and the associated diverse range of epifauna species are not easily monitored via traditional methodologies (e.g. morpho-taxonomic identification and enumeration, and compound analyses of sediment grabs). Consequently, little is known about many of the benthic inhabitants, or how they may respond to fish farming. In this study, we aimed to initiate addressing this knowledge gap by assessing the response of the sponge Weberella bursa (Polymastidea) to salmon aquaculture. Fourteen specimens were translocated along a distance gradient from a salmon farm located along the mid-west coast of Norway. Following 7 months of exposure, their epithelial tissue were analysed for gene expression analysis (mRNA), fatty acid (FA), stable isotope and taxonomic and functional microbiome characterization. Among all datasets, only fatty acid profiles showed significant changes associated with fish farm activities, with higher proportion of terrestrial FAs and long saturated and monounsaturated FAs near the farm. These results suggest that W. bursa sponges may be more resistant to organic enrichment than previously thought. Nonetheless, several putative indicators of non-lethal response could be identified. Specifically, W. bursa specimens located underneath the farm tended to have reduced ribosomal activity while having increased expression of genes controlling cell apoptosis (e.g. caspase-3, cytochrome c oxidase and death domain proteins). Based on predictive functional analysis, specimens near to the farm were also found to be particularly enriched in sulfur and nitrogen cycling bacteria, and in microbial taxa with anti-toxin and xenobiotic biodegradation capability, notably of benzyl benzoate compounds used in sea lice treatments. These results indicate that potentially harmful elements such as sulfite, nitrite and pesticides may be neutralized and degraded by a particularly enriched set of bacteria in W. bursa microbiome. While additional research is needed to validate these putative indicators, our study provides a first glimpse as to how sessile organisms may respond and adapt to environmental changes induced by fin fish farming, and pave the way to the development of novel monitoring tools adapted to mix and hard bottom habitats.

AB  - The commercialization of growth hormone transgenic Atlantic salmon for aquaculture has become a controversial public policy issue. Concerns exist over the potential ecological effects of this biotechnology should animals escape captivity. From within an ecological risk-analysis framework, science has been sought to provide decision makers with evidence upon which to base regulatory decisions pertaining to genetically modified salmon. Here I review the available empirical information on the potential ecological and genetic effects of transgenic salmon and discuss the underlying eco-evolutionary science behind the topic. I conclude that data gaps and irreducible epistemic uncertainties limit the role of scientific inference in support of ecological risk management for transgenic salmon. I argue that predictive uncertainties are pervasive in complex eco-evolutionary systems and that it behooves those involved in the risk-analysis process to accept and communicate these limitations in the interest of timely, ...

AB  - This paper reports the results of a survey of public attitudes towards aquaculture, using salmon farming in Scotland as a case study. The aims have been to identify the priority that people attach to the environmental performance of the salmon aquaculture industry, relative to other objectives, and to measure the economic benefits to society from salmon farmed using methods that cause less organic pollution. The results indicate that the public attach a relatively high importance to minimizing environmental damage from aquaculture, and this has its parallel in the finding that people are willing to pay a price premium for salmon produced in a more environmentally benign way.

AB  - Like many sectors, the expansion of aquaculture has issues related to sustainable resource use and environmental change. These challenges are widely recognised and are addressed with sectoral strategies. Even when culturing a single species, the specifics of impacts, constraints and pressures are likely to vary in effects for different farm types. On the other hand, production efficiencies can drive farms towards homogeneity. A simple model is used in this study to demonstrate farm-scale budgets and the pressure to intensify production towards an optimum. A range of interventions can provide incentives for less intensive production: these include price premiums and altered cost bases. Integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) does not offer a route to less intensive production systems if the productivity of the extractive species (e.g., algae) is linked to the intensity of the fish farm, although alternative incentives for IMTA are possible. Increases in the intensity of production (as stocking density) can be mitigated by increasing farm capacity. An expanded production model suggests that this will lead to larger farms at relatively high stocking densities. Where farms are subject to variable economic and biological processes, this can lead to some combinations of intensity and capacity to have less variable earnings than others. The promotion of diverse aquaculture sectors may allow some of the ecological and social synergies available to smaller farms to be combined at a regional scale with the greater production of large farms. Cost, price and/or regulatory incentives are needed to create diverse production systems.

AB  - According to Chilean legislation, a salmonid concession holder must choose between two mutually exclusive stocking density systems: Stocking Reduction Percentage (SRP) or Stocking by Density. This study identifies the main determinants in the choice of stocking system and estimates their marginal effects. The results suggest that if the previously stocked species is Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), the probability of stocking by SRP increases by 36.6%. On the other hand, a high and medium environmental rating (determined according to mortality, use of antibiotics, and pharmacological products during the previous productive cycle) has a negative effect. At the same time, a lower rating positively impacts the choice of SRP. Whatever the selection, obtaining a poor biosecurity classification should not necessarily be interpreted as a sanction due to the fact the salmonid concession holder simply has the option to choose the other method, which would deem the policy of regulatory authority meaningless from this perspective.

We richten ons daarbij in het bijzonder op de milieuprestaties. In dit onderzoek doorlopen we de volgende stappen: 1. We voeren een levenscyclusanalyse (LCA) uit om de milieuprestaties van schol en kabeljauw in kaart te brengen en te vergelijken met die van zalm, tilapia en pangasius. Deze analyse is te beschouwen als de kern van het onderzoek; 2. We vergelijken de resultaten van de LCA met de resultaten van LCA-onderzoek naar rundvlees, varkensvlees en kip; 3. We beschrijven welke impact verwachte verbeteringen in de visserij en aquacultuur zullen hebben op de LCA. Omdat er geen data voor tong beschikbaar waren, hebben we ons voor Noordzeevis gericht op schol en kabeljauw.

AB  - Point sources such as wastewater treatment plants, terrestrial agriculture, and aquaculture may release antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into aquatic ecosystems. However, there is a lack of quantitative studies attributing environmental ARG abundance to specific sources. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of freshwater trout farms in the release and dissemination of ARGs into the environment. Sediment samples upstream and downstream from five rainbow trout farms were collected over time in southern Chile. A microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach was used to quantify an ARG array covering different mechanisms of resistance, and data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and linear mixed regression models. Surveys were also conducted to obtain information about management practices, including antibiotic use, at the farms. Florfenicol and oxytetracycline were used at these farms, although at different rates. A total of 93 samples were analyzed. In the PCA, , , , , (A), (B), (C), (W), and grouped together. A statistically significant increase in abundance of , , , and several genes was found downstream from the farms compared with upstream sites, and retention ponds had the highest ARG abundance at each site. Antibiotic resistance gene levels returned to baseline at an average distance of 132.7 m downstream from the farms. Although results from this study indicate an influence of trout farms on the presence of ARGs in the immediate environment, the extent of their contribution to ARG dissemination is unknown and deserves further investigation.

AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing agricultural sectors globally and is becoming increasingly important for producing sustainable and healthy diets with relatively low climate impacts. In comparison to livestock production, especially beef, seafood production has lower carbon emissions. Additionally, some species can extract carbon from aquatic environments, contributing to an extended carbon cycle. However, the potential for negative environmental consequences in aquaculture production might increase with the growing global population and demand for aquatic food. Herein, we review the environmental consequences of aquaculture production and the potential effects of different aquatic products on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We also summarize approaches to improving environmental footprints for mitigating global climate change. Key elements, including improving feed efficiency, selecting suitable farmed species, and implementing sustainable farming practices and management in aquaculture, are discussed, as well as the trade-offs between aquaculture and capture fisheries. Crucially, performance gaps among farmed species underscore the potential for consumer-oriented advice to significantly reduce the effects of aquaculture on climate change. However, uncertainties and knowledge gaps related to carbon sequestration and GHG emissions in aquaculture ponds necessitate further research. Overall, holistic evaluation and strategic intervention regarding GHG emissions are fundamental and essential for achieving a sustainable, low-carbon future for aquaculture.

AB  - An analysis of the notifications in the European Union (EU) Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) portal due to residues of veterinary drugs in fish and fish products over the period 2001–2021 was conducted examining the following data: number and type of notifications; year of notification; notification basis; notifying country; country of origin; action taken; distribution status; risk decision; fish product type; residue found. A total of 292 notifications were found (mean number/year 9.8 ± 13.8 SD), mostly information notifications (60.9%). The most common notification basis was “border control - consignment detained” (38.4%), followed by “official control on the market” (37.9%) and “border control - consignment released” (13.7%). Over half (54.1%) of the notifications were issued by the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, dominant countries in the fish processing market. Thirty-one countries of origin were recorded, but 48.6% of the notifications were referred to products from Vietnam, followed by China (15.7%), that are among the leading fish producing countries. The most common actions taken were re-dispatch (23.3%), followed by recall from consumer (10.3%), withdrawal from recipients (9.9%), destruction (9.6%), and import not authorised (9.2%). Overall, 28.8% of the notifications involved fish products belonging to the Pangasiidae family (Pangasius spp. and Pangasianodon spp.), followed by tilapia (12.7%), trout (11.0%), eel (8.6%), catfish (7.9%) and salmon (3.4%). Triphenylmethane dyes and their metabolites were the most frequent category of residues found, accounting for 51.4% of the total notifications, followed by a wide range of antibiotics classes, of which nitrofurans and metabolites (19.5%) were the most common, while amphenicols (6.8%), quinolones and fluoroquinolones (6.5%), sulphonamides and potentiators (5.1%), tetracyclines and metabolites (3.4%) and other classes were less represented. Avermectins and unspecified residues were also found in a few cases (2.7%). The annual frequency of these issues varied and was probably influenced by dedicated monitoring plans, as well as by specific sanitary problems occurring in farms. Nevertheless, by providing historical trends and current issues, our analysis identified hazards to be closely monitored, through coordinated official controls especially in the most involved countries.

AB  - This article explores to what extent escaped farmed salmon from fish farms affect the willingness-to-pay for recreational fishing of Atlantic salmon in Norwegian rivers. This is a first attempt to explore the economic consequences of escaped farmed species in terms of the anglers’ willingness-to-pay for fishing permits working through the relationship between the price of fishing permits and the share of escaped farmed salmon. The empirical analysis is based on the results from a contingent valuation survey conducted in Norway. It is found that the presence of escaped farmed salmon in Norwegian rivers may have severe economic consequences on the willingness-to-pay for recreational fishing with a reduction of up to 85% compared to a situation with a ‘pure’ wild salmon stock.

AB  - The plasma pharmacokinetics of danofloxacin was studied in healthy African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) following a single intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) administration of 10 mg/kg at 22 °C. Catfish were divided into two groups (each group containing 78 fish), then danofloxacin mesylate (10 mg/kg) was administered IV (into the caudal vein) in Group 1 and IM (into the right epaxial muscle) in Group 2, and blood was obtained from the caudal vein before (0 h) and after (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h) of drug administration. High-performance liquid chromatography was used for the determination of plasma concentration, and a non-compartmental model was used for the analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters. After IV administration, elimination half-life (t1/2λz, 24.49 h), mean residence time (MRT, 30.14 h), volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss, 1.07 L/kg) and total body clearance (CLT, 0.035 L/h/kg) were determined. After IM administration, t1/2λz, MRT, peak concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax and bioavailability were 47.64 h, 61.06 h, 5.22 µg/mL, 1 h and 67.12%, respectively. After IM administration, danofloxacin showed good bioavailability and long t1/2λz. The favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics after IM administration support the use of danofloxacin for the treatment of susceptible bacterial infections in catfish.

AB  - As global salmon production accelerates in response to higher consumer demand for seafood, so does the need for sophisticated monitoring strategies to enable and maintain ethically sound, productive, and environmentally friendly production of fish. Innovative technologies are needed to ensure proper water quality, react to unfavorable hydrodynamic conditions, monitor for changes in fish health, and minimize ecological interactions with indigenous aquatic life, including fish escapes. Automated sensors connected wirelessly to data stations, visualization aids, and acoustic and physical tagging technologies are emerging tools capable of detecting environmental stress and its associated behavioral changes in farmed fish. Computer modeling of the monitoring data collected from a single salmon farm or collection of farms sharing a data network can be used to spot environmental trends vital for anticipating some of the consequences of climate change. Environmental regulations governing salmon farming in coastal areas are becoming more stringent in response to public pressures to protect coastal and ocean resources and to provide for multipurpose use of marine resources. As net-pen salmon aquaculture expands globally, new technologies will be essential to collect and interpret the anticipated larger volumes of data needed to meet these stringent regulatory requirements and to safeguard the high investment costs inherent in salmon farming. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;18:950-963. © SETAC.

AB  - Humans depend on services provided by ecosystems, and how services are affected by climate change is increasingly studied. Few studies, however, address changes likely to affect services from seminatural ecosystems. We analyzed ecosystem goods and services in natural and seminatural systems, specifically how they are expected to change as a result of projected climate change during the 21st century. We selected terrestrial and freshwater systems in northernmost Europe, where climate is anticipated to change more than the global average, and identified likely changes in ecosystem services and their societal consequences. We did this by assembling experts from ecology, social science, and cultural geography in workshops, and we also performed a literature review. Results show that most ecosystem services are affected by multiple factors, often acting in opposite directions. Out of 14 services considered, 8 are expected to increase or remain relatively unchanged in supply, and 6 are expected to decrease. Although we do not predict collapse or disappearance of any of the investigated services, the effects of climate change in conjunction with potential economical and societal changes may exceed the adaptive capacity of societies. This may result in societal reorganization and changes in ways that ecosystems are used. Significant uncertainties and knowledge gaps in the forecast make specific conclusions about societal responses to safeguard human well-being questionable. Adapting to changes in ecosystem services will therefore require consideration of uncertainties and complexities in both social and ecological responses. The scenarios presented here provide a framework for future studies exploring such issues.

AB  - Pesticides are substances that kill pestiferous organisms. They include insecticides against insect pests, herbicides against weeds, fungicides against fungal pathogens, acaricides against spiders and mites, molluscicides against slugs, and so on. Pesticide use is increasing worldwide with thousands of products available that are applied in million tons per year. Agriculture is the sector with the highest pesticide use, with fruit producing or viticulture being much more pesticide-intensive than arable cropping. Pesticide use is being justified by securing higher yields that are considered more important to human society than potential side effects of pesticides. It is estimated that only about 10% of the applied pesticides are actually effective against the pests or diseases they are intended to control. Besides agriculture, pesticides are also applied in private gardens, on railway tracks, in airplanes, in landscaping, on sports grounds, golf courses and even in nature conservation areas. Manufacturers and regulators are reassuring that pesticides are among the best tested substances and everything is alright as long as they are applied according to their recommendations. However, pesticide drift leads to contaminations far away from their location of application, thus can affect everybody. When pesticide residues are found in food products, maximum residue limits convey safety-but these limits are being adjusted steadily.

AB  - The utilization of feed resources in Norwegian salmon farming has previously been reported for 2010, 2012 and 2016. This paper presents an update for 2020, giving an overview of the feed ingredients used and retention of nutrients in fillet and whole salmon for the entire Norwegian salmon production. A total of 1,976,709 tonnes of feed ingredients were used to produce 1,467,655 tonnes of salmon. The feed was produced from 22.4 % marine ingredients, 73.1 % vegetable ingredients and 4.1 % micro ingredients such as vitamin and mineral premixes, astaxanthin and crystalline amino acids. In addition, 0.4 %, or 8126 tonnes, of single cell protein, insect meal, fermented products and microalgae were used in salmon feeds. Norwegian marine protein and marine oil constituted 8.3 % of the ingredients. The remaining 91.7 % of the ingredients were imported. The feed conversion factor was 1.35 if calculated from feed ingredients ‘as is’, or 1.25 if calculated form ingredients on dry matter basis. The retention of energy, dry matter, protein, fat, EPA + DHA and phosphorus from feed was 39 %, 33 %, 34 %, 57 %, 49 % and 25 %, respectively, in whole salmon. In fillet, the corresponding retention rates were 25 %, 21 %, 25 %, 35 %, 32 % and 12 %, respectively. The feed ingredients used and the utilization of feed in 2020 resembled that of 2016, except that there was an increase in the amount produced in 2020 and a slight increase in the economic feed conversion ratio (eFCR).

AB  - The literature on productivity growth in the grow-out phase for salmon is substantial, yet little attention has been given to productivity growth of the input factors. This is despite the fact that a number of innovations have improved quality and reduced prices for many input factors that contribute to the competitiveness of the industry. This article provides an analysis of productivity growth for one key input factor in salmon farming, juvenile salmon. We estimate translog cost functions on salmon hatcheries for the period 1988 to 2010. The econometric analysis shows that innovations and productivity growth have led to a reduction of unit costs in production of salmon juveniles, particularly at earlier stages, but the rate of technical progress has declined in recent years.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to characterize using whole-genome sequencing analysis, a new variant of the qnrB gene (qnrB89) carried by a fluoroquinolone-susceptible bacterium isolated from mucus of farmed Salmo salar fingerling in Chile. Citrobacter gillenii FP75 was identified by using biochemical tests and 16S ribosomal gene analysis. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the qnrB89 gene exhibited an identity to qnrB of 81.24% and 91.59%, respectively. The genetic environment of qnrB89 was characterized by the upstream location of a sequence encoding for a protein containing a heavy metal-binding domain and a gene encoding for a N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase protein, whereas downstream to qnrB89 gene were detected the csp and cspG genes, encoding cold-shock proteins. The qnrB89 gene was located on a large chromosomal contig of the FP75 genome and was not associated with the 10-kb plasmid and class 1 integron harbored by the FP75 strain. This study reports for the first time the carriage of a qnrB gene by the C. gillenii species, and its detection in a bacterial strain isolated from farmed salmon in Chile.

AB  - Disease and parasitism cause major welfare, environmental and economic concerns for global aquaculture. In this review, we examine the status and potential of technologies that exploit genetic variation in host resistance to tackle this problem. We argue that there is an urgent need to improve understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved, leading to the development of tools that can be applied to boost host resistance and reduce the disease burden. We draw on two pressing global disease problems as case studies-sea lice infestations in salmonids and white spot syndrome in shrimp. We review how the latest genetic technologies can be capitalised upon to determine the mechanisms underlying inter- and intra-species variation in pathogen/parasite resistance, and how the derived knowledge could be applied to boost disease resistance using selective breeding, gene editing and/or with targeted feed treatments and vaccines. Gene editing brings novel opportunities, but also implementation and dissemination challenges, and necessitates new protocols to integrate the technology into aquaculture breeding programmes. There is also an ongoing need to minimise risks of disease agents evolving to overcome genetic improvements to host resistance, and insights from epidemiological and evolutionary models of pathogen infestation in wild and cultured host populations are explored. Ethical issues around the different approaches for achieving genetic resistance are discussed. Application of genetic technologies and approaches has potential to improve fundamental knowledge of mechanisms affecting genetic resistance and provide effective pathways for implementation that could lead to more resistant aquaculture stocks, transforming global aquaculture.

AB  - Objectives: In 2017 the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Committee on Fisheries committed to prioritize occupational safety and health issues in aquaculture (AOSH). An international team was established to synthesize OSH knowledge concerning more than 19 million, often vulnerable, aquaculture workers found globally.Methods: The study was conducted as a desktop scoping exercise using both peer-reviewed and gray literature and the knowledge and expertize of an international panel. Collated information used a standard proforma. Panel members developed draft national and regional AOSH profiles outlining occupational hazards contributing to occupational injuries, diseases, and known solutions. These were work-shopped and refined after gathering additional information and used to compile the first global scoping review report on AOSH.Results: Synthesized results revealed multiple hazards, significant global knowledge gaps and some successful and unsuccessful global, national and industry-specific AOSH policies, practices and standards along the primary supply chain, in marine and freshwater contexts. Some constructive initiatives by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and FAO, industry, labor and civil society groups in a range of employment and geographical settings and across diverse populations of workers were identified.Conclusion: Global commitment to AOSH should be given the same focus as product quality, biosecurity, food safety and environmental sustainability in the sector. This needs development and implementation of integrated AOSH actions appropriate for diverse settings especially in low and middle-income countries encompassing greater uptake of international codes, better risk assessment and OSH management, adoption of technological innovations, effective OSH regulation and enforcement, adequate resources, training and information.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, to assess how concerned Norwegians are about fish welfare; second, to investigate Norwegians’ willingness to pay for salmon filet made from welfare-assured farmed fish with high levels of welfare; and third, to examine Norwegian opinions about the appropriate way to pay for better welfare standards in fish production. Design/methodology/approach – On the basis of two focus group sessions, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to a representative sample of 2,147 Norwegian households via e-mail. Findings – Results showed that the Norwegian public is concerned about fish welfare and is willing to pay a price premium for products made from welfare-assured fish. Norwegian consumers do not, however, want to be the only ones paying for fish welfare, as the main responsibility for fish welfare lies with producers and the Government. Research limitations/implications – In this study willingness to pay is measured using a hypothetical choice ex...

AB  - Due to the reduced efficacy of delousing drugs used for sea lice control in salmon aquaculture, fish vaccines have emerged as one of the most sustainable strategies in animal health. Herein, the availability of <i>C. rogercresseyi</i> and <i>Salmo salar</i> genomes increases the capability of identifying new candidate antigens for lice vaccines using RNA sequencing and computational tools. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of two recombinant antigens characterized as peritrophin and cathepsin proteins on the transcriptome profiling of Atlantic salmon during a sea lice infestation. Four experimental groups were used: Peritrophin, cathepsin, and peritrophin/cathepsin (P/C), and PBS as the control. <i>C. rogercresseyi</i> female, <i>S. salar</i> head kidney, and skin tissue samples were sampled at 25 days post-infestation (dpi) for Illumina sequencing and RNA-seq analysis. Differential gene expression, gene ontology, and chromosomal expression analyses were performed. Furthermore, the dual RNA-seq analysis approach was performed to simultaneously explore host and pathogen transcriptomes, identifying functional associations for vaccine design. The morphometry of female sea lice exposed to immunized fish was also evaluated. The RNA-Seq analysis exhibited prototype-dependent transcriptome modulation, showing a conspicuous competition for metal ions during the infestation. Moreover, Dual RNA-seq analysis revealed vaccine-dependent gene patterns in both the host and the pathogen. Notably, significant morphometric differences between lice collected from immunized and control fish were observed, where cathepsin and P/C showed 57% efficacy. This study showed the potential of two proteins as lice vaccines for the salmon industry, suggesting novel molecular mechanisms between host-parasite interactions.

AB  - The supply of dissolved oxygen (DO) to salmon in sea cages depends on many interacting factors including biomass density, temperature and current speed. With other factors being equal, hypoxic conditions are more likely to arise in large cages compared to small. In this work, a mathematical model of DO in sea cages is used to analyse the effect of horizontal cage size in particular. It is shown and quantified how the DO level at key locations in the cage depend on cage radius and current speed, and the fraction of the cage volume with hypoxic conditions is estimated as a function of cage radius, current speed and temperature. The results of this study give new insight into how oxygen conditions are affected when cage size is scaled up or down. Although conditions at actual aquaculture sites are highly variable and complex, the results can help forecast the effect of increasing cage size at existing sites, and can help guide the planning of new production sites with regard to oxygen supply.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. The dissolved oxygen (DO) levels of coastal ocean waters have decreased over the last few decades in part because of the increase in surface and subsurface water temperature caused by climate change, the reduction in ocean ventilation, and the increase in stratification and eutrophication. In addition, biological and human activity in coastal zones, bays, and estuaries has contributed to the acceleration of current oxygen loss. The Patagonian fjord and channel system is one world region where low-DO water (LDOW, 30 %–60 % oxygen saturation) and hypoxia conditions (&lt;30 % oxygen saturation, 2 mL L−1 or 89.2 µmol L−1) are observed. An in situ dataset of hydrographic and biogeochemical variables (1507 stations), collected from sporadic oceanographic cruises between 1970 and 2021, was used to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the presence of LDOW and hypoxic conditions in northern Patagonian fjords. Results denoted areas with LDOW and hypoxia coinciding with the accumulation of inorganic nutrients and the presence of salty and oxygen-poor Equatorial Subsurface Water mass. The role of biological activity in oxygen reduction was evident in the dominance of community respiration over gross primary production. This study elucidates the physical and biogeochemical processes contributing to hypoxia and LDOW in the northern Patagonian fjords, highlighting the significance of performing multidisciplinary research and combining observational and modeling work. This approach underscores the importance of a holistic understanding of the subject, encompassing both real-world observations and insights provided by modeling techniques.

AB  - Aquaculture surpassed wild fisheries as the largest supplier of fish for human consumption in 2014 and is expected to supply the majority of seafood for future increases in demand. Marine and coastal aquaculture, collectively referred to as mariculture, currently represents just 36% of aquaculture production but is poised to expand in the decades ahead. One of the most commonly cited concerns regarding this likely expansion is ecological and socioeconomic interactions with wild‐capture fisheries. While attention has largely been drawn to high‐profile negative externalities from fed finfish and crustacean mariculture, not all marine‐based practices are equivalent. Empirical evidence for the different interactions between mariculture and wild fisheries is often sparse. While negative consequences can arise, positive synergies can also occur. By considering mariculture development in the context of fisheries interactions, we suggest that it is possible to minimize conflicts and maximize positive connections between the two sectors. We provide the first comprehensive synthesis of the interactions between mariculture and wild fisheries, characterizing the types of interactions, evaluating available empirical evidence and identifying where management (sector‐specific and cooperative) can play an important role. We highlight potential effects of mariculture on the efficiency, sustainability, and equity of seafood production and identify remaining knowledge gaps.

AB  - This work describes a novel sensing system using eggshells as substrate for the first time, targeting the detection and semiquantitative determination of antibiotics in waters from aquaculture, enabling simple, inexpensive, and in situ drug monitoring. Eggshell was ground and the resulting powder was modified by adsorption of suitable reagents, and it takes a typical colour after contact with the antibiotic. The colour intensity is correlated with the concentration of the antibiotic. This novel approach was applied to oxytetracycline, one of the antibiotics commonly used in aquaculture. The chemical changes on the eggshell powder were evaluated and optimised to produce an intense colour change as a function of the concentration of the antibiotic. The colour changes were evaluated by visual comparison with images taken with a digital camera, applying an appropriate mathematical treatment to the colour coordinates of the HSL system used by Windows. The selectivity of the response was tested against other antibiotic drugs. The materials were also used in the analysis of a spiked environmental water sample. Overall, this work presents a rapid, inexpensive, simple and equipment-free method for screening and discrimination of tetracycline drugs in aquaculture. The method is a green approach by reusing eggshells and decreasing the level of contamination correlated to analytical methods, thus being a promising tool for local, rapid, and cost-effective antibiotic monitoring.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Dispersal is a ubiquitous ecological process that has been extensively studied in many plants and animals. Anadromous salmonids are an interesting system for examining dispersal, in part because of their well-known philopatric behavior, but also because of the conservation challenges related to the dispersal of hatchery-origin fish. Building on earlier work, we provide an updated systematic review of dispersal and gene flow in anadromous salmonids. In particular, we compared studies on dispersal of anadromous salmonids from wild and hatchery origins, including studies providing estimates of dispersal rates, observations of dispersal, and results from modelling studies. We reviewed 228 studies and found these were unevenly distributed among species, with Atlantic salmon, Chinook salmon, and sea trout being well-represented. Our results showcase considerable variability in estimated dispersal rates within and across studies, which is likely related to the different methodologies, dispersal propensities across species and populations, and spatial extents considered. Overall, our results confirmed a higher tendency of hatchery fish to disperse relative to wild fish, but we also found some variation across species that warrants further study. Moreover, we found that dispersal propensity tended to decline exponentially with distance, and that the drivers of dispersal varied considerably among studies. Additionally, we highlight various facets of dispersal captured across this suite of studies, including variation in terminology, methods and metrics for characterizing dispersal, and the spatio-temporal scales considered. Finally, our review revealed that few studies considered, and even fewer assessed, the implications of dispersal for the conservation and management of anadromous salmonids.</jats:p>

AB  - Streptococcosis, particularly that caused by <i>S. iniae</i> and <i>S. agalactiae</i>, is a major re-emerging bacterial disease seriously affecting the global sustainability of aquaculture development. Despite a wide spread of the disease in aquaculture, few studies have been directed at assessing the in vitro antagonistic activity and <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of medicinal herbs and other plants against streptococcal agents. Most <i>in vitro</i> studies of plant extractives against <i>S. iniae</i> and <i>S. agalactiae</i> have found antibacterial activity, but essential oils, especially those containing eugenol, carvacrol or thymol, are more effective. Although essential oils have shown better anti-streptococcal activity in <i>in vitro</i> assays, <i>in vivo</i> bioassays require more attention. The extracts examined under in vivo conditions show moderate efficacy, increasing the survival rate of infected fish, probably through the enhancement of immunity before challenge bioassays. The available data, however, lack dosage optimization, toxicity and bioavailability assays of a specific plant or its bioactive compound in fish organs; hence, it is difficult to judge the validation of clinical efficacy for the prevention or treatment of fish streptococcosis. Despite the known bioactive compounds of many tested plants, few data are available on their mode of action towards streptococcal agents. This review addresses the efficacy of medicinal plants to fish streptococcosis and discusses the current gaps.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the influences of dietary β-glucan on growth rate, antioxidant status, immunity response, and resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila of genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus). Four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated to contain 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8% β-glucan, respectively. Fish with similar size (average body weight, 3.43 ± 0.02 g) were randomly distributed into 12 tanks with 40 juveniles per tank and hand-fed to apparent satiation twice daily for 10 weeks. The fish were then challenged by A. hydrophila and their cumulative survival rate was recorded for the next week. No obvious influences on growth rate and feed utilization of GIFT were induced by dietary β-glucan addition (P > 0.05). However, dietary 0.4% β-glucan inclusion increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level but decreased the triglyceride, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as well as alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities (P < 0.05). Similarly, the increased intestinal superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) activities as well as the decreased intestinal malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species contents were also observed in GIFT fed diet with 0.4% β-glucan (P < 0.05). Dietary addition of 0.8% β-glucan increased the plasma SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase, and TAC activities, but reduced the plasma MDA content (P < 0.05). Dietary β-glucan inclusion regardless of levels improved the hepatic SOD, glutathione reductase, catalase, peroxidase, TAC, and acid phosphatase activities, but depressed the hepatic nitric oxide and MDA contents (P < 0.05). Plasma lysozyme activity was improved by the inclusion of 0.4% and 0.8% β-glucan (P < 0.05); plasma immunoglobulin M, complement 3 and complement 4 contents were improved by dietary β-glucan inclusion (P < 0.05); respiratory burst activity of macrophages was improved by the addition of 0.2% β-glucan (P < 0.05). Additionally, dietary β-glucan supplementation reduced the mortality rate and increased the relative percentage survival of GIFT challenged by A. hydrophila (P < 0.05). These results indicated that suitable β-glucan inclusion (0.4–0.8%) could promote the antioxidant status, immune response and disease resistance of GIFT, and β-glucan can be used as a feed additive for GIFT.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ayu (<jats:italic>Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis</jats:italic>) is an important freshwater fisheries resource and popular recreational fishing species in Japan that lives for only 1 year, with a single breeding season. To supplement increased recreational fishing demand for this species, more than 13 million wild‐born landlocked juveniles are translocated every year from Lake Biwa into Japanese rivers, and more than 52 million hatchery‐reared juveniles born from captive‐reared parents have been extensively released. The translocation of landlocked juveniles and hatchery release has continued for more than 100 and 30 generations, respectively. Previous studies have reported that landlocked and amphidromous forms of Ayu easily hybridise, leading to concerns that the fitness of hybrid progeny would be reduced in the wild. However, limited information exists regarding the reproductive success of landlocked Ayu in translocated rivers, and to date no studies have evaluated the effects of translocation on population structure. Demonstrating that hybridisation occurs between the two forms is central to future management and conservation of this species. To address this, a literature search to summarise biological knowledge of Ayu and population genetic data screening was undertaken, and published genetic data sets covering a distribution range in Japan were reanalysed. Analyses provide strong evidence for very high gene flow between sampling locations. Genetic diversity is homogeneous in amphidromous samples. Bayesian admixture analysis infers widespread hybridisation in Japanese rivers (24 ± 8%). Maximum likelihood admixture graphs detect two migration events from Lake Biwa to rivers in the northern Sea of Japan and Hokkaido. Analyses consistently indicate that hybridisation between translocated landlocked juveniles and native amphidromous Ayu occurs throughout Japanese rivers. These results are discussed in relation to the management of this species.</jats:p>

AB  - Real estate management and its operation play a crucial role in supporting company operation. Going hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of companies, the real estate portfolio has expanded dramatically, attracting large numbers of domestic and foreign investors. This paper studied the top 12 real estate companies listed on Vietnam’s stock market to develop a method that combines the Grey methodology and the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Malmquist model, intending to predict and evaluate their performances in two periods: 2015–2018 and 2019–2022. The proposed model considered three input factors, namely total assets, cost of sales, and cost of goods sold, and two output factors, namely total revenue and gross profit. Findings revealed that drastic efficiency changes in some companies should be observed at the beginning of the process, even if the technological efficiency in the period is stable. In the future period, most companies achieved relatively stable productivity. This study serves as a reference for policymakers and strategy makers by analyzing insights for the operational status of real estate businesses and providing an overview in the future toward sustainable development.

AB  - <i>Piscirickettsia salmonis</i> is the pathogen that most affects the salmon industry in Chile. Large quantities of antibiotics have been used to control it. In search of alternatives, we have developed [Cu(NN<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]ClO<sub>4</sub> where NN<sub>1</sub> = 6-((quinolin-2-ylmethylene)amino)-2H-chromen-2-one. The antibacterial capacity of [Cu(NN<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]ClO<sub>4</sub> was determined. Subsequently, the effect of the administration of [Cu(NN<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]ClO<sub>4</sub> on the growth of <i>S. salar</i>, modulation of the immune system and the intestinal microbiota was studied. Finally, the ability to protect against a challenge with <i>P. salmonis</i> was evaluated. The results obtained showed that the compound has an MIC between 15 and 33.9 μg/mL in four isolates. On the other hand, the compound did not affect the growth of the fish; however, an increase in the transcript levels of IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-1β, CD4, lysozyme and perforin was observed in fish treated with 40 μg/g of fish. Furthermore, modulation of the intestinal microbiota was observed, increasing the genera of beneficial bacteria such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bacillus</i> as well as potential pathogens such as <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Piscirickettsia</i>. Finally, the treatment increased survival in fish challenged with <i>P. salmonis</i> by more than 60%. These results demonstrate that the compound is capable of protecting fish against <i>P. salmonis</i>, probably by modulating the immune system and the composition of the intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Effective disease management can benefit from mathematical models that identify drivers of epidemiological change and guide decision-making. This is well illustrated in the host–parasite system of sea lice and salmon, which has been modelled extensively due to the economic costs associated with sea louse infections on salmon farms and the conservation concerns associated with sea louse infections on wild salmon. Consequently, a rich modelling literature devoted to sea louse and salmon epidemiology has been developed. We provide a synthesis of the mathematical and statistical models that have been used to study the epidemiology of sea lice and salmon. These studies span both conceptual and tactical models to quantify the effects of infections on host populations and communities, describe and predict patterns of transmission and dispersal, and guide evidence-based management of wild and farmed salmon. As aquaculture production continues to increase, advances made in modelling sea louse and salmon epidemiology should inform the sustainable management of marine resources.

AB  - The disposal of antibiotics in the aquatic environment favors the selection of bacteria exhibiting antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Quinolones are bactericidal antimicrobials extensively used in both human and animal medicine. Some of the quinolone-resistance mechanisms are encoded by different bacterial genes, whereas others are the result of mutations in the enzymes on which those antibiotics act. The worldwide occurrence of quinolone resistance genes in aquatic environments has been widely reported, particularly in areas impacted by urban discharges. The most commonly reported quinolone resistance gene, <i>qnr</i>, encodes for the Qnr proteins that protect DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from quinolone activity. It is important to note that low-level resistance usually constitutes the first step in the development of high-level resistance, because bacteria carrying these genes have an adaptive advantage compared to the highly susceptible bacterial population in environments with low concentrations of this antimicrobial group. In addition, these genes can act additively with chromosomal mutations in the sequences of the target proteins of quinolones leading to high-level quinolone resistance. The occurrence of <i>qnr</i> genes in aquatic environments is most probably caused by the release of bacteria carrying these genes through anthropogenic pollution and maintained by the selective activity of antimicrobial residues discharged into these environments. This increase in the levels of quinolone resistance has consequences both in clinical settings and the wider aquatic environment, where there is an increased exposure risk to the general population, representing a significant threat to the efficacy of quinolone-based human and animal therapies. In this review the potential role of aquatic environments as reservoirs of the <i>qnr</i> genes, their activity in reducing the susceptibility to various quinolones, and the possible ways these genes contribute to the acquisition and spread of high-level resistance to quinolones will be discussed.

AB  - A large number of farmed red sea bream (Pagrus major ) and their gametes have escaped and dispersed into the wild from net-cage aquaculture since the advent of the technology in the mid-20th century. These escapees have likely been recruited into wild populations, affecting their genetic diversity. In this study, we used assignment methods with microsatellite markers to assess the frequency of escapee farmed red sea bream within the wild populations in a major aquaculture production region (UWJ) and in two regions with relatively lower production (IWG and SIJ) in Ehime Prefecture, Japan. The frequency of escapees in UWJ ranged from 14.1% to 30.2%, as shown by three methods of assignment. Escapees were frequently identified among specimens caught by angling (ranging from 26.7% to 46.7%), suggesting that they stay in the same area even after escape or are less cautious than wild individuals. No escapee was found in IWG and SIJ, areas with less extensive aquaculture. Some wild-caught fish appeared to have hybridized with farmed fish, as indicated by the threshold of membership coefficients obtained by simulation. These results clearly indicate that large numbers of farmed individuals have escaped from UWJ, a major aquaculture area, since the inception of red sea bream farming in Japan. Genetic reshuffle has possibly occurred following hybridization of wild and farmed individuals.

AB  - The fishFish farming sector heavily depends on water quality as one of its primary production inputs. With economic growth, aquacultureAquaculture products become a significant supply of protein for human consumption and the fastest-expanding food production sector. This industry uses a lot of water, which results in a lot of effluent being produced. The high concentration of organic elements and organisms in the effluents contributes to environmental contamination. This contribution focuses on issues related to clean water affected by the skyrocketing expansion and growth of the fishFish farm industry. Discussion and awareness regarding the large usage of chemicals for the treatment of fish illnesses and its effects on the quality of clean water are presented. It is shown that many environmental pollutants can accumulate in farmed species affecting their health and quality. An adequate evaluation and control of aquatic environmental repercussions are both becoming more and more crucial. Thus, the sensorSensor systems presented here allow a rapid and inexpensive control of water pollution in fishFish farms.

AB  - In real-world situations, marine fish farms accommodate multiple fish species and cohorts within the farm, leading to diverse farm layouts influenced by cage dimensions, configurations, and intricate arrangements. These cage management practices are essential to meet production demands, however, farm-level complexities can impact model predictions of waste deposition and benthic impact near fish cages. This is of particular importance when the cages are used for integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) with benthic feeders, where this waste not only affects environmental conditions but also provides a potential food source. The Cage Aquaculture Particulate Output and Transport (CAPOT) model incorporated multiple species, cohorts, and cage arrangements to estimate waste distribution from a commercial fish farm in the Mediterranean between October 2018 and July 2019. This spreadsheet model estimated dispersion for individual fish cages using a grid resolution of 5 m x 5 m. The study categorized discrete production periods for each fish cage every month, aligning with intermittent changes in biomass and food inputs due to different cage management practices throughout production. This approach facilitated the use of detailed input data and enhanced model representativeness by considering variations in cage biomass, food types, settling velocities, and configurations. Model outputs, represented in contour plots, indicated higher deposition directly below fish cages that varied monthly throughout fish production cycles. Deposition footprints reflected changes in cage biomass, food inputs, and farm-level practices reflecting this real-world scenario where aquaculture does not follow a production continuum. Moreover, cohort dynamics and cage movements associated with the cage management practices of the fish farm influenced the quantity and fate of wastes distributed around fish cages, revealing variability in deposition footprints. Clearly, these findings have important implications for the design of benthic IMTA systems, with species such as sea cucumber and polychaetes. Variability in waste deposition creates challenges in identifying where the benthic organisms should be placed to allow optimal uptake of waste to meet their food requirements and increase survivability. Evidently, models have an important role to play and this study emphasizes the need for representative input data to describe actual food inputs, cage biomass changes, and management practices for more representative farm-scale modelling and essentially to improve particulate waste management. To effectively mitigate benthic impacts through IMTA, models must quantify and resolve particulate waste distribution and impact around fish farms to maintain a balanced system with net removal of wastes. Resolving farm-level complexities provides vital information about the variability of food availability and quality for extractive organisms that helps improve recycling of organic wastes in integrated systems, demanding a more representative modelling approach.

AB  - Polarisation of opinions across communities can lead to social conflict, reputational damage and the disruption of operations and markets. Social influence models have been widely used to better understand processes driving conflict from a theoretical perspective. Using aquaculture as a case study, we demonstrate how such models can be extended to accurately hindcast the transition from population consensus to high conflict, including observed catastrophic tipping points. We then use the model to quantitatively evaluate strategies aimed at reducing aquaculture conflict. We found that persuasive advocacy was ineffective and often counterproductive, whereas meaningful engagement, collaborative learning and improving scientific literacy targeted broadly across the population was effective in moderating opinions and reducing conflict. When such messaging was targeted too narrowly or too infrequently, it tended to be negated by ongoing exchange of misinformation within the population. Both the modelling approach and lessons on effective communication strategies are relevant to a broad range of environmental conflicts.

AB  - Farmed shrimp contributed 27% of total world shrimp production in 1995 with a volume of 712 000 tonnes. Undoubtedly, the shrimp culture industry earns valuable foreign exchange for developing countries and generates jobs across the industry from fry gatherers to growers and processors. However, grave socio-economic consequences – including conversion, expropriation and privatization of mangroves and other lands; salinization of water and soil; decline in food security; marginalization of coastal communities, unemployment and urban migration; and social conflicts – have followed in the wake of, shrimp farm development in the Philippines and other tropical countries.

The paper focuses on mangrove ecosystems: the valuation and cost-benefit analysis of their goods and services, and the mangrove-offshore fisheries connection. Research gaps in these areas and the need to internalize the ecological and socio-economic costs (‘externalities’) of shrimp farming are highlighted. Other recommendations include mangrove conservation and rehabilitation, enforcement of existing legislation, and introduction of environment-friendly aquaculture within the broader framework of community-based, integrated coastal area management, e.g. the traditional, extensive polyculture ponds in Indonesia.

AB  - Aquaculture is an essential and growing component of agricultural and global ecosystems worldwide. Aquaculture provides more than 25% of the total aquatic food consumption by humans. The development of the aquaculture industry should be followed in successive industrial years, and therefore it is necessary to pay attention to the management and type of farming system that is compatible with the environment. The use of antibiotics for disease control has been criticised for their negative effects, including the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the suppression of the immune system and the environment, and the accumulation of residue in aquatic tissues. The use of these products reduces the need for treatments, enhances the effect of vaccines, and, in turn, improves production indicators. Medicinal plants have increasingly been used in recent years as a disease control strategy in aquaculture, boosting the immune system of aquatic animals and helping to develop strong resistance to a wide range of pathogens. Therefore, this review aims to provide an overview of the recent evidence on the beneficial use of medicinal plants to promote growth and strengthen the immune system in farmed aquatic animals.

AB  - Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) escape from net pens and enter rivers to spawn, potentially resulting in genetic introgression and reduced fitness of wild salmon. Here, we quantify genetic introgression of farmed to wild salmon, using molecular genetic markers, in populations from 147 salmon rivers, representing three-quarters of the total wild salmon spawning population in Norway. For 109 rivers with adult modern samples and sample sizes of 20 or more, the average level of farmed genetic introgression was 6.4% (median1⁄4 2.3%), with a range between 0.0% and 42.2%. Fifty-one of these rivers showed significant farmed genetic introgression when compared with historical reference samples. We observed a highly significant correlation between estimated farmed introgression and average proportion of escaped farmed salmon. We quantify levels of introgression as unweighted averages or weighted by population sizes, to compare geographical regions and to compare levels of introgression in rivers and fjords designated as locations deserving a high level of protection. We found a generally lower level of introgression in National Salmon Rivers and National Salmon Fjords subjected to formal protection by parliament. We conclude that farmed to wild genetic introgression is high in a large proportion of Norwegian salmon rivers, with the highest levels found in the most intensive areas of salmon farming. The extensive genetic introgression documented here poses a serious challenge to the management of farmed and wild Atlantic salmon in Norway and, in all likelihood, in other regions where farmed-salmon escape events occur with regularity

AB  - Large quantities of the antibiotic florfenicol are used in animal farming and aquaculture, contaminating the ecosystem with antibiotic residues and promoting antimicrobial resistance, ultimately leading to untreatable multidrug-resistant pathogens. Florfenicol-resistant bacteria often activate export mechanisms that result in resistance to various structurally unrelated antibiotics. We devised novel strategies for the enzymatic inactivation of florfenicol in different media, such as saltwater or milk. Using a combinatorial approach and selection, we optimized a hydrolase (EstDL136) for florfenicol cleavage. Reaction kinetics were followed by time-resolved NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, the hydrolase remained active in different media, such as saltwater or cow milk. Various environmentally-friendly application strategies for florfenicol inactivation were developed using the optimized hydrolase. As a potential filter device for cost-effective treatment of waste milk or aquacultural wastewater, the hydrolase was immobilized on Ni-NTA agarose or silica as carrier materials. In two further application examples, the hydrolase was used as cell extract or encapsulated with a semi-permeable membrane. This facilitated, for example, florfenicol inactivation in whole milk, which can help to treat waste milk from medicated cows, to be fed to calves without the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance. Enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics, in general, enables therapeutic intervention without promoting antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Abstract To mitigate salmon lice infestations in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) sea cages, deployment of cleaner fish have become a widespread strategy. However, species of cleaner fish may experience poor welfare in the highly fluctuating farm environment owing to differences in physiological adaptations and niche requirements. In particular, occurrences of reduced oxygen levels are common in salmon cages. The purpose of this study was therefore to compare hypoxia responses of Atlantic salmon and two commonly used cleaner fish species, the lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) and the ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta). We used respirometry to measure metabolic rates (MO2) during progressive hypoxia down to 20% oxygen saturation. In addition, we also measured key haematological parameters before, during and after hypoxia exposure. While all fish survived exposure down to 20% oxygen saturation, distinct differences in metabolic and haematological responses were found, reflecting species specific adaptations and lifestyles. In Atlantic salmon, MO2 was independent of ambient oxygen levels until 27% saturation, after which it decreased linearly. In lumpfish, MO2 steadily decreased throughout the hypoxia trial. In ballan wrasse, MO2 was notably lower than in the other species and unaffected by the levels of hypoxia encountered. Hypoxia induced changes in plasma cortisol, plasma lactate and plasma osmolality were substantially greater in Atlantic salmon compared to both cleaner fish species. This suggests that similar magnitudes of hypoxia exposure were more stressful to Atlantic salmon. Hence, neither cleaner fish species should be in immediate danger as long as hypoxia levels that are known to be detrimental to Atlantic salmon are avoided. However, lumpfish had markedly reduced activity levels at the early onset of progressive hypoxia, and is therefore likely to require near normoxic conditions to efficiently function as cleaner fish.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We employ comprehensive sea‐lice data and recreational catch data from Norway to assess the impact of farm sea‐louse infestations on wild salmon catches in different production areas (PAs).</jats:p></jats:list-item>

The effect is most pronounced in PA 4 on the west coast of Norway, an area within the government's” traffic light” management system where out‐migrating salmon smolts are deemed to face high risk of louse‐induced mortality.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Our model predicts below‐average catches when the total sea‐louse load exceeds the limit of 0.1 average adult female sea louse per farmed fish within some production areas. Furthermore, our results indicate that the risk of below‐average catches increases by approximately 47% when salmon farms exceed this limit (estimated risk ratio of 1.47, 95% CI [1.10, 1.96]).</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis and applications</jats:italic>: Our study expands the existing body of evidence demonstrating a negative association between fish farming and the ecosystem services provided by wild salmon stocks. This has important implications for aquaculture management. First, it shows that farm sea lice directly affect peoples, rights holders and interest groups, such as landowners and anglers, who rely on viable populations of wild salmon. Second, it suggests that a &gt;0.1 sea lice limit may be insufficient to prevent subpar catches in some areas. Furthermore, in the context of allowing further growth in farmed salmon biomass, setting absolute sea‐louse limits for entire production areas may be a more effective regulatory instrument than setting average lice limits per farmed fish. Our findings contribute to advancing a scientific basis for setting appropriate louse limits on farm and area scales.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

The use of copper based antifoulants contributes to marine pollution and managing biofouling on untreated nets incurs a heavy cost on the industry. What is needed is an antifoulant coating that balances the needs of the industry with good environmental practices. This study describes the effectiveness of seven alternative netting treatments and two copper based treatments as compared to an untreated nylon net. Effectiveness was measured in terms of percent net occlusion, percent cover of major fouling groups and biomass. Following eight months immersion, results show that the alternative treatments did not out-perform the untreated nylon control, and that the two copper treatments significantly outperformed the control and all of the alternative treatments tested in this study. The results demonstrate that the alternative treatments tested in this study were unable to meet the performance standards set by industry, that more research is needed into alternative antifoulant coatings for aquaculture, and that the effectiveness of copper based treatments will continue to be a barrier to the implementation of alternative antifouling treatments. keywords: biofouling; salmon; copper antifoulant; image analysis

AB  - There is a growing scientific and legislative consensus that fish are sentient, and therefore have the capacity to experience pain and suffering. The assessment of the welfare of farmed fish is challenging due to the aquatic environment and the number of animals housed together. However, with increasing global production and intensification of aquaculture comes greater impetus for developing effective tools which are suitable for the aquatic environment to assess the emotional experience and welfare of farmed fish. This study therefore aimed to investigate the use of Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA), originally developed for terrestrial farmed animals, in farmed salmon and evaluate its potential for use as a welfare monitoring tool. QBA is a ‘whole animal’ approach based on the description and quantification of the expressive qualities of an animal’s dynamic style of behaving, using descriptors such as relaxed, agitated, lethargic, or confident. A list of twenty qualitative descriptors was generated by fish farmers after viewing video-footage showing behaviour expressions representative of the full repertoire of salmon in this context. A separate, non-experienced group of ten observers subsequently watched twenty-five video clips of farmed salmon, and scored the twenty descriptors for each clip using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). To assess intra-observer reliability each observer viewed the same twenty-five video clips twice, in two sessions 10 days apart, with the second clip set presented in different order. The observers were unaware that the two sets of video clips were identical. Data were analysed using Principal Component (PC) Analysis (correlation matrix, no rotation), revealing four dimensions that together explained 79% of the variation between video clips, with PC1 (tense/anxious/skittish – calm/mellow/relaxed) explaining the greatest percentage of variation (56%). PC1 was the only dimension to show acceptable inter- and intra-observer reliability, and mean PC1 scores correlated significantly to durations of slow and erratic physical movements measured for the same 25 video clips. Further refinements to the methodology may be necessary, but this study is the first to provide evidence for the potential of Qualitative Behavioural Assessment to serve as a time-efficient welfare assessment tool for juvenile salmon under farmed conditions.

AB  - The present study assessment of energy use, economic productivity and environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) for different production of fish systems in Alborz province. Productivity indicators and the provision of necessary solutions in order to improve the values of energy and economic indices in fish breeding ponds have been implemented. For this purpose, information related to the two fish systems sites was collected by a questionnaire and direct reference to the site owners and administrators and reference to the records. Then, the amount of energy input and output of cold-water and hot-water fish was calculated. The results showed energy ratio (ER) (2.24), energy productivity (EP) (0.04 kg MJ−1), energy intensity (EI) (26.83 MJ kg−1) and net energy gain (NEG) (33222.16 MJ kg−1) of cold-water fish were reported to be more favorable. According to these results, among energy use inputs, fish feed and electricity are two factors that proper management of their consumption increases energy efficiency. The results of economic analysis showed the benefit-to-cost ratio was positive for cold-water fish (1.54) and hot-water fish (2.45). Productivity for cold-water and hot-water fish was 0.58 Kg $−1 and 0.52 Kg $−1, respectively. LCA results showed that damage assessment of human health, ecosystem quality and resources for cold-Water and hot-water fish production are (0.00041 and 0.00045) DALY, (4.04E-08 and 4.61E-08) species.yr and (0.076 and 0.087) USD2013, respectively. The results of cumulative exergy demand (CExD) also indicated that the energy form of non-renewable, fossil is significant for both types of fish.

AB  - Abstract Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) is one of the main mediators of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary–Interrenal (HPI) axis to stress response. In Atlantic salmon, a comparative understanding of the crf1 paralogs role in the stress response is still incomplete. Our database searches have identified four crf1 genes in Atlantic salmon, named crf1a1, crf1a2, crf1b1 and crf1b2. Brain distribution analysis revealed that the four crf1 paralogs were widely distributed, and particularly abundant in the telencephalon, midbrain, and hypothalamus of Atlantic salmon post-smolts. To increase the knowledge on crf1-mediated response to stress, Atlantic salmon post-smolts were exposed to either repeated chasing, hypoxia or a combination of chasing and hypoxia for eight days, followed by a novel-acute stressor, confinement. Cortisol, glucose, lactate, and creatinine levels were used as markers for the stress response. The crf1 paralogs mRNA abundance showed to be dependent on the stress exposure regime. Both crf1 mRNA levels in the telencephalon and crf1a1 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus showed similar response profiles to the serum cortisol levels, i.e., increasing levels during the first 24 h after stress exposure followed by a decline during the eight-day exposure. The similar trend between crf1 and cortisol disappeared once exposed to the novel-acute stressor. There was a minor response to stress for both crf1b1 and crf1b2 in the hypothalamus, while no changes at mRNA level were observed in the hypothalamic crf1a2 under the different stress conditions. No or weak relationship was found between the crf1 paralogs mRNA expression and the other serum stress-indicators analysed. In summary, our data provide novel insights on the dynamic of the HPI axis activation in Atlantic salmon, and thus underline the involvement of the crf1 paralogs as additional factors in the regulation of the stress response in this species. Likewise, the data highlight the importance of analysing all crf1 paralogues response to a stress-condition, in particular in this premature knowledge stage of their functionality. Further analysis and a more detailed time-point series will help to elucidate the response of the HPI axis and the link of crf1 paralogs in the stress response mechanism.

AB  - Persistent Vibrio-parahaemolyticus-associated vibriosis cases, attributed, in part, to the inefficient techniques for detecting viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) Vibrio pathogens and the ingestion of undercooked seafood, is the leading cause of bacterial seafood-borne outbreaks, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. The effect of extreme heat processing on Vibrio biology and its potential food safety implication has been underexplored. In the present work, environmental samples from the wet market, lagoon, and estuarine environments were analyzed for V. parahaemolyticus recovery using a modified, temperature-dependent, two-step enrichment method followed by culture-based isolation, phenotype, and genotype characterizations. The work recovered novel strains (30% of 12 isolates) of V. parahaemolyticus from prolonged-heat-processing conditions (80 °C, 20 min), as confirmed by 16S rDNA bacterial identification. Select strains, VHT1 and VHT2, were determined to be hemolysis- and urease-positive pathogens. PCR analyses of chromosomal DNA implicated the tdh-independent, tlh-associated hemolysis in these strains. Both strains exhibited significant, diverse antibiotic profiles (p < 0.05). Turbidimetric and viable count assays revealed the pasteurization-resistant V. parahaemolyticus VHT1/VHT2 (62 °C, 8 h). These findings disclose the efficiency of Vibrio extremist recovery by the modified, two-step enrichment technique and improve knowledge of Vibrio biology essential to food safety reformation.

AB  - Increasing studies of plastisphere have raised public concern about microplastics (MPs) as vectors for pathogens, especially in aquatic environments. However, the extent to which pathogens affect human health through MPs remains unclear, as controversies persist regarding the distinct pathogen colonization on MPs as well as the transmission routes and infection probability of MP-associated pathogens from water to humans. In this review, we critically discuss whether and how pathogens approach humans via MPs, shedding light on the potential health risks involved. Drawing on cutting-edge multidisciplinary research, we show that some MPs may facilitate the growth and long-range transmission of specific pathogens in aquatic environments, ultimately increasing the risk of infection in humans. We identify MP- and pathogen-rich settings, such as wastewater treatment plants, aquaculture farms, and swimming pools, as possible sites for human exposure to MP-associated pathogens. This review emphasizes the need for further research and targeted interventions to better understand and mitigate the potential health risks associated with MP-mediated pathogen transmission.

AB  - Animal migration has fascinated scientists and the public alike for centuries, yet migratory animals are facing diverse threats that could lead to their demise. The Anthropocene is characterised by the reality that humans are the dominant force on Earth, having manifold negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem function. Considerable research focus has been given to assessing anthropogenic impacts on the numerical abundance of species/populations, whereas relatively less attention has been devoted to animal migration. However, there are clear linkages, for example, where human-driven impacts on migration behaviour can lead to population/species declines or even extinction. Here, we explore anthropogenic threats to migratory animals (in all domains - aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial) using International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Threat Taxonomy classifications. We reveal the diverse threats (e.g. human development, disease, invasive species, climate change, exploitation, pollution) that impact migratory wildlife in varied ways spanning taxa, life stages and type of impact (e.g. from direct mortality to changes in behaviour, health, and physiology). Notably, these threats often interact in complex and unpredictable ways to the detriment of wildlife, further complicating management. Fortunately, we are beginning to identify strategies for conserving and managing migratory animals in the Anthropocene. We provide a set of strategies that, if embraced, have the potential to ensure that migratory animals, and the important ecological functions sustained by migration, persist.

AB  - In recent years there has been increased interest in the transaction forms in salmon markets, given that contracts have become more common, vertical mergers create firms that cover several levels in the supply chain, and futures markets have developed as a price risk tool. These are strong indications that salmon supply chains are developing in the same direction as supply chains for more processed food products. In this article we investigate to what extent this development has influenced the price transmission process for two product forms: a relatively unprocessed one (fresh fillets) and a more processed one (smoked salmon). Results indicate that the supply chain for fresh fillets can still be characterized by a high degree of price transmission. On the contrary, the hypothesis of full price transmission for smoked salmon is rejected.

AB  - Cultured salmon as escapees should never threaten salmon stocks in the wild as long as they are healthy and are not genetically manipulated. By studying a key digestive protease, trypsin, which is sensitive to environmental changes and influences on food utilisation and growth during the whole life cycle of Atlantic salmon, it is indicated that changes in the phenotypic expression of trypsin can be induced by temperature during egg incubation and the start-feeding period of the alevins. In addition, Atlantic salmon with the same trypsin phenotype showed different feed conversion efficiency and growth rate at different temperatures. Trypsin genes seem to be stable, and although the pattern of expressed genes varies extensively, the expression of trypsinogen mRNA is quantitatively similar between individual salmon in line with the observation that the total trypsin specific activity was similar between the fish with different trypsin phenotypes. However the luminal secretion of the active enzyme, and probably the relative amounts of trypsin isozymes, could be modified by water temperature and food quality. These results indicate that changes in the environmental condition can influence gene expressions of the fish at DNA, RNA and protein levels, regardless of genetic expression of parents. This means that whether the escapees or wild fish is the spawning population, an incidence of the offsprings to have their gene expressions adapted to that environment will be similar. It is the environmental condition that has to be conserved in order to control the genetic structure of animals in the wild. It is naive to think that genetically manipulated escapees such as triploid salmon will not have any impact on wild population, as they are not fertile. Under a more favourable condition for growth, triploid escapees could compete with wild fish on food availability as they have higher consumption rates for higher growth rates, unlike ordinary diploid salmon that could have better food utilisation at a similar consumption rate. This may cause a higher survival rate in triploid escapees and if they spawn, hatching success and survival rate of the offsprings will be low due to low gamete quality for reproduction in triploid fish. This could result in a smaller population of the new generation in that environment in the wild.

AB  - Cultivation of kelp has been well established throughout Asia, and there is now growing interest in the cultivation of macroalgae in Europe to meet future resource needs. If this industry is to become established throughout Europe, then balancing the associated environmental risks with potential benefits will be necessary to ensure the carrying capacity of the receiving environments are not exceeded and conservation objects are not undermined. This is a systematic review of the ecosystem changes likely to be associated with a developing seaweed aquaculture industry. Monitoring recommendations are made by risk ranking environmental changes, highlighting the current knowledge gaps and providing research priorities to address them. Environmental changes of greatest concern were identified to include: facilitation of disease, alteration of population genetics and wider alterations to the local physiochemical environment. Current high levels of uncertainty surrounding the true extent of some environmental changes mean conservative risk rankings are given. Recommended monitoring options are discussed that aim to address uncertainty and facilitate informed decision-making. Whilst current small-scale cultivation projects are considered ‘low risk’, an expansion of the industry that includes ‘large-scale’ cultivation will necessitate a more complete understanding of the scale dependent changes in order to balance environmental risks with the benefits that seaweed cultivation projects can offer.

AB  - Abstract The Norwegian aquaculture industry faces pressure from stakeholders, the public, and government to ensure sustainable production. Sustainability is closely linked with solving key environmental challenges. Standards such as those created by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) are universal and generally provide what is known as additionality to state regulation, such as more comprehensive requirements, with the goal of enhancing sustainability. Acquiring certification can be expensive, but it has been shown that the industry spends large amounts of time and resources to voluntarily become ASC certified. In this article, we study the motivations for ASC certification. In line with previous work, we find several motivations for obtaining certification, even though it is no guarantee for financial gains like premium prices or better market access. Still, it may be just as valuable for industry actors to use certification to create room to maneuver so as to be prepared for future market claims, changes in regulations, and increased pressure for more sustainable production. Furthermore, certification is perceived as having the potential to improve producers' and retailers' reputation and standing both locally and globally. Certification and the use of labels can be tools in reputational management. By reducing complexity and uncertainty in communication, certification labelling can help consumers improve their product choices in terms of sustainability. Industry actors in this study express approval of certification and desire the potential reputational gain that comes from it; however, our findings suggest that this potential has not been fully realized. The industry experiences challenges in communicating with the local and global public and lacks influence on what is communicated to consumers through retailers. Therefore, it appears that those actually reaping the potential reputational gains of ASC certification are the non-governmental organizations behind the creation of the ASC and the retailers that demand ASC-certified salmon.

AB  - Commercial farming of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) is now being developed in several countries. The ecological consequences of cod culture are poorly understood, but recent research suggests that Atlantic cod are more prone to escape from net pens than Atlantic salmon. Here, we describe the movements and the spatiotemporal distribution of farmed cod after escape relative to wild cod, both during and outside the natural spawning season. The experimental design included simulating escape incidents of farmed cod tagged with acoustic transmitters and using an array of automatic listening stations to monitor their dispersal and distribution. For comparison, local wild cod were monitored using the same array of receivers. The farmed cod dispersed rapidly after a simulated escape, they randomly distributed over large areas and their distribution overlapped with local wild cod. Moreover, escaped farmed fish were found at local cod spawning areas during the spawning season. The study also indicated that the recapture rate of escaped farmed cod was high compared with that of escaped farmed salmon. Thus, while our results showed that there is a considerable potential for ecosystem effects caused by escaped farmed cod, mitigating actions such as an efficient recapture fishery for escapees may be possible.

AB  - Mass mortality events (MMEs) threaten the health of fish and are also a potential threat to the health and safety of workers. This paper presents findings from a desktop risk assessment exercise focused on potential aquaculture occupational health and safety (AOHS) hazards and risks associated with MMEs in Chile. The study reviews academic and grey literature, government regulations and MME reports and statistics to assess the scale and distribution of MMEs; identifies associated documented and potential health and safety hazards; and documents and assesses policy responses to MMEs in the Chilean context through the lens of health and safety. The paper documents the size and regional distribution of salmon MME occurrences in Chile from 2016 to 2022. It discusses AOHS hazards associated with MMEs such as exposure to hydrogen sulfide, drowning and diving-related illnesses and potential issues around accessing hospitals and hyperbaric chambers for workers in remote aquaculture regions, as well as exposure to antibiotics and antibiotic residues. Recent Chilean regulatory requirements around reporting and management of MMEs that have the potential to help reduce identified MME-related risks for workers are described and addressed.Key policy highlights Risk of mass mortality events (MMEs) in marine aquaculture is increasing as the industry expands and climate change increases fluctuations in marine conditions. Policies need to be developed to counteract these risks.MMEs-related worker accidents and environmental degradation point to the urgent need to develop environmental and occupational health and safety (OHS) guidelines that prevent MMEs and protect workers and the environment.The Chilean OHS guidelines related to aquaculture MMEs may be adapted and used in other countries.Surveillance programs on harmful algal blooms and antibiotic resistance (AMR) markers may be a preventive measure towards MMEs and exposure to AMR markers.

AB  - Abstract This paper investigates the development of production costs in aquaculture of Atlantic salmon between the five main producer countries. A unique data set allows us to analyse the development in the period 2003 to 2018. Costs have developed differently between countries, with Chile and the Faroe Islands standing out with strong and different changes. Chile sees a strong increase in cost and moves from being the lowest to the highest cost producer, and then to lowest again. The Faroe Islands has the opposite development and moves from being the highest to one of the lowest cost producers. For Norway and Canada the changes are considerably smaller, while Scotland has had the most marked cost increase. For the Faroe Islands and Chile, major disease outbreaks play a major role in explaining the change in cost. Differences between countries are also related to scale, natural conditions, currency development and regulations. Results show that Norway's position as the leading salmon producing country in terms of market share seems justified by its low production cost.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Gill disease of farmed Atlantic salmon (<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>) in the marine environment has emerged as a significant problem for the salmon aquaculture industry. Different types of marine salmon gill disease reported include amoebic gill disease (AGD), parasitic gill disease, viral gill disease, bacterial gill disease, zooplankton (cnidarian nematocyst)‐associated gill disease, harmful algal gill disease and chemical/toxin‐associated gill disease. The term ‘multifactorial gill disease’ is used when multiple distinguishable types of disease (as opposed to an obvious single primary type) are present. When gill disease is non‐specific, it is referred to as ‘complex gill disease’ (CGD) or ‘complex gill disorder’. These two terms are often used interchangeably and are overlapping. The significance of many infectious and non‐infectious agents that may be associated with CGD is often unclear. In this review, we summarise aspects of the different types of gill disease that are relevant to the epidemiology of gill disease and of CGD in particular. We also tabulate simultaneously occurring putative pathogens to explore the multifactorial nature of gill disease.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Sustainable development is an overarching objective that requires an interdisciplinary approach in order to address the societal challenge concerning climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials. In this context, valorization of abundant and available bio-wastes with high potential to manufacture value-added products is the first step to close the loop between waste and consumption in line with the main goal of the circular economy. In the last years, many research works have been published in the literature regarding novel food packaging. However, most of them are focused on packaging composition (scientific aspects) and some of them on the packaging manufacture (technological aspects), but very few studies are concerned about the influence of bringing novel food packaging systems into the market on environmental, social and economic issues. In this regard, this review intends to fill this gap, considering the potential of developing food packaging from food processing waste in order to create business for food industries, being aware of the food quality demanded by consumers and the environmental care demanded by institutions and society.

AB  - Aquatic animal diseases are one of the major limiting factors in aquaculture development, with disease emergence forecast to increase with global change. However, in order to treat increasing diseases in a context of global emergence of antimicrobial resistance and strengthening regulations on antimicrobial use, sustainable alternatives are urgently needed. The use of plant supplements to increase fish immunity and disease resistance has gained much popularity within the last decades. The use of functional supplements, such as plants, can also improve growth and feed assimilation, contributing to a better optimization of aquaculture resources (e.g. fish meal inclusion). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to identify the research gaps in the use of plant-enriched diets in fish aquaculture and estimate, for the first time, the overall efficacy of plant-enriched diets on fish growth, immunity and disease resistance as well as the effect of intrinsic parameters (fish trophic level, type of plant material, dosage, treatment duration and pathogen species) on the treatment efficacy. We found that plant-enriched diets significantly enhanced growth, immunity and disease survival of treated fish, regardless of the fish trophic level, treatment duration and type of material used. We also show that plant supplements are a versatile alternative that can benefit different aquaculture sectors (from small-scale fish farmers to intensive productions). Finally, we observed that studies need to improve the information reported about the plant material used (e.g. origin, identification, chemical composition), in order to allow the comparison of different experiments and improve their repeatability.

AB  - The sea louse <i>Caligus rogercresseyi</i> genome has opened the opportunity to apply the reverse vaccinology strategy for identifying antigens with potential effects on lice development and its application in sea lice control. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of three sea lice vaccines against the early stage of infestation, assessing the transcriptome modulation of immunized Atlantic salmon. Therein, three experimental groups of <i>Salmo salar</i> (Atlantic salmon) were vaccinated with the recombinant proteins: Peritrophin (prototype A), Cathepsin (prototype B), and the mix of them (prototype C), respectively. Sea lice infestation was evaluated during chalimus I-II, the early-infective stages attached at 7-days post infestation. In parallel, head kidney and skin tissue samples were taken for mRNA Illumina sequencing. Relative expression analyses of genes were conducted to identify immune responses, iron transport, and stress responses associated with the tested vaccines during the early stages of sea lice infection. The vaccine prototypes A, B, and C reduced the parasite burden by 24, 44, and 52% compared with the control group. In addition, the RNA-Seq analysis exhibited a prototype-dependent transcriptome modulation. The high expression differences were observed in genes associated with metal ion binding, molecular processes, and energy production. The findings suggest a balance between the host's inflammatory response and metabolic process in vaccinated fish, increasing their transcriptional activity, which can alter the early host-parasite interactions. This study uncovers molecular responses produced by three vaccine prototypes at the early stages of infestation, providing new knowledge for sea lice control in the salmon aquaculture.

AB  - ABSTRACTFinancial statement information is important for evaluating a firm’s performance, and for forecasting its future cash flows. This paper studies the relationship between financial accounting information and market valuation for publicly listed salmon farming companies. Of special interest is the impact on market valuation, of a requirement for salmon farmers to disclose the effect on their financial numbers of the fair-value adjustment of biomass. The results suggest that the fair-value adjustment results in higher volatility of profits, and lower value relevance for investors.

AB  - EPA + DHA intake in land-locked central Europe (CE) is barely fulfilled. Imported marine fish/farmed salmonids are likely the backbone of an ailing EPA + DHA security. Supplementing with captured marine fish oil capsules (~0.5 g up to 1.6 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. mg EPA + DHA<sup>-1</sup>) could be comparable in GHG emissions with fish consumption itself (~1 g to as low as 0.6 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. mg EPA + DHA<sup>-1</sup>). But synergistic benefits of EPA + DHA intake by consuming fish protein need consideration too. Taking semi-intensive pond carp and intensively farmed salmon as models, we analyzed footprint, eco-services, and resource use efficiency perspectives of achieving EPA + DHA security in a CE region. Despite a lower production footprint, pond-farmed fish greatly lag in EPA + DHA supply (carp 101-181 mg 100 g<sup>-1</sup> < salmon 750-1300 mg 100 g<sup>-1</sup>). It doubles-to-quadruples footprint 'per mg' of EPA + DHA: nitrogen (carp 18.3 > salmon 8.7 mg N), phosphorus (carp 6.8 > salmon 1.6 mg P), and climate change (carp 1.84 > salmon 0.8 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq.). With enhancements in pond carp (>300 mg EPA + DHA 100 g<sup>-1</sup>), these differences may cease to exist. Harnessing EPA + DHA bioaccumulation pathways active in ponds, finishing feeding strategies, and polyculture, the EPA + DHA content in pond fish may be increased. Ecosystem services with EPA + DHA mining from pond food web or high EPA + DHA output-to-input ratio (pond carp 1-200 > RAS salmon 0.75) make ponds an eco-efficient system. As fish consumption in CE must improve, pond-farmed fish would be needed to complement (but not substitute) salmonid/marine fish/oil capsules consumption. Achieving EPA + DHA security with minimum pressure on the environment or global resources.

        <jats:p>Microplastics, an emerging pollutant, have garnered widespread attention due to potential repercussions on human health and the environment. Given the critical role of seafood in food security, growing concerns about microplastics might be detrimental to meeting future global food demand. This study employs a discrete choice experiment to investigate Chilean consumers' preferences for technology aimed at mitigating microplastic levels in mussels. Using a between-subjects design with information treatments, we examined the impact of informing consumers about potential human health and environmental effects linked to microplastics pollution on their valuation for the technology. We found that the information treatments increased consumers’ willingness to pay for them. Specifically, consumers’ willingness to pay for mussels with a 90% depuration efficiency certification is around US$ 4. The provision of health impact information increased the price premium by 56%, while the provision of environmental information increased it by 21%. Furthermore, combined health and environmental information significantly increased the probability of non-purchasing behavior by 22.8% and the risk perception of microplastics for human health by 5.8%. These results emphasize the critical role of information in shaping consumer preferences and provide evidence for validating investment in research and development related to microplastic pollution mitigation measures.</jats:p>

AB  - Despite much innovation and development in the Norwegian salmon industry, the focus has largely been on building volume and reducing costs. Limited attention has been paid to develop value added products and differentiation strategies in Norway to reap stable profits associated with such strategies. In depth-interviews with a supply chain containing Norwegian salmon producers, one exporter and one feed producer, industrial buyers representing two Polish processing companies and two German retailers, aimed to provide insight into why more differentiation is not happening in the Norwegian salmon industry. Results from this supply chain reveals lack of communication and asymmetric power-dependence relations between the Norwegian salmon business actors and their industrial buyers.

AB  - This paper discusses the relationship between industry growth and environmental quality in the context of salmon aquaculture. It is argued that industry growth can reduce pollution by inducing more technological innovations for industry-specific, pollution-reducing inputs. This increases the elasticity of substitution between conventional factors of production on the one hand, and pollution on the other, and therefore enables a greater degree of internalization of environmental problems. Four indicators of pollution are examined for Norwegian salmon aquaculture. The salmon aquaculture industry is one in which growth is associated with reduced environmental problems not only in relative, but also in absolute terms.

AB  - Abstract Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate environmental impacts of simultaneous fish and plant production through the aquaculture practice of aquaponics. In aquaponics, hydroponic plant production replaces the conventional water treatment processes of microbial nitrification and water exchanges required in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) to maintain water quality. The system expansion method was used to assess potential avoided burdens from coproduction of recovered solids, plant production, and water treatment. Results indicated that electricity and feed were the main contributing factors to environmental impact. Impact assessment results were highly sensitive to changes in electricity inputs, suggesting that a small reduction in electricity could contribute to a correspondingly large change in the environmental impact. Avoided burdens associated with coproducts contributed to a moderate reduction in environmental impact compared to reducing total electricity inputs or sourcing electric...

AB  - Intensive fish farming has faced a number of environmental challenges both locally and globally. In this paper we review some of the most important environmental issues that has faced fish farming and then see how the industry has handled these challenges. Salmon aquaculture has probably faces more of these challenges than any other farmed species, with the possible exception of shrimp aquaculture. We concentrate on empirical evidence related to salmon, although the issues related to other farmed species are similar to that of salmon. Other environmental issues include degradation of local habitat, disruption of ecological systems, and detrimental impact on wild species. Evidence suggests that most of the local environmental problems have been resolved or minimized through industry action and governmental regulations, although a few challenges remain.

AB  - <jats:p> Twenty-six years ago, in response to regionally devastating fisheries collapses in Canada, Hutchings et al. asked “Is scientific inquiry incompatible with government information control?” Now, a quarter-century later, we review how government science advice continues to be influenced by non-science interests, particularly those with a financial stake in the outcome of the advice. We use the example of salmon aquaculture in British Columbia, Canada, to demonstrate how science advice from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) can fail to be impartial, evidence-based, transparent, and independently reviewed—four widely implemented standards of robust science advice. Consequently, DFO's policies are not always supported by the best available science. These observations are particularly important in the context of DFO having struggled to sustainably manage Canada's marine resources, creating socio-economic uncertainty and putting the country's international reputation at risk as it lags behind its peers. We conclude by reiterating Hutchings et al.’s unheeded recommendation for a truly independent fisheries-science advisory body in Canada to be enshrined in the decision-making process. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The Inner Sea of Chiloé (ISC) in northwestern Patagonia has experienced large harmful algal blooms in the past decade, impacting human health and affecting the large aquaculture industry of the region. Thus, the investigation of factors favouring regional phytoplankton growth are of particular interest. Analysing the synoptic-to-intraseasonal variability, we explore changes in phytoplankton biomass in southern ISC (S-ISC, 42.5°-43.5°S, 72.5°-74°W) and their concurrent mesoscale and large-scale meteorological and oceanographic conditions. We use high-resolution satellite normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) and chlorophyll-a (CHL-A) from the MODIS-Aqua sensor as proxies for phytoplankton biomass, besides oceanic and atmospheric variables derived from various remote-sensing sources and atmospheric fields from the ERA5 reanalysis. Specifically, we focus on high phytoplankton biomass events HBEs, which are defined as those cases when intraseasonal nFLH anomaly (nFLH’) exceeds the 95th percentile threshold. Each event was characterised by its first date of occurrence (called day 0). We detected 16 HBE between 2003 and 2019 in S-ISC. HBEs tend to occur under the influence of a mid-latitude migratory anticyclone that induce persistent cloudless conditions preceding day 0, leading to enhanced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) starting around day -8, and positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies between days -4 and +4. We hypothesise that HBEs are mainly modulated by i) mixing and advection that could contribute to a greater availability of nutrients in the upper sea layers before the onset of the anticyclonic anomalies; and ii) increased thermal stratification related to positive PAR and SST anomalies that would promote phytoplankton growth during the anticyclonic regime. Furthermore, we show that the Madden-Julian Oscillation modulates the frequency of nFLH’ and thus of HBEs, a result that suggests an enhanced predictability of these cases.</jats:p>

AB  - Salmon is a nutritious and popular food among consumers predominantly in wealthy countries around the world. Since the mid-1990s farmed salmon production has exceeded wild salmon harvest, and is now 80 % of total global salmon supply. The environmental impacts of farmed salmon are frequently discussed and consumers are faced with a multitude of choices even after deciding to have salmon for dinner: species, production method, origin, product form. We present life cycle impacts of fresh and frozen salmon products, originating in purse seine fisheries for pink salmon and gill net fisheries for sockeye salmon in Alaska, when sold on markets in Europe and the United States. Norwegian salmon products are then modelled to the same markets in fresh and frozen form, based on literature data. Impact categories included were greenhouse gas emissions, marine eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity and land use. A fish in, fish out ratio is also calculated and differences in content of nutrients and contaminants described. Frozen products from wild sockeye and pink salmon had the lowest emissions in both markets. For consumers in the U.S. and Europe, wild salmon products have 46-86 % and 12-71 % lower greenhouse gas emissions than farmed Norwegian salmon, respectively, depending on species and product form. Farmed salmon also had higher land use, marine ecotoxic and eutrophying emissions and fish in, fish out ratio. Important differences exist in nutritional and contaminant content between the three types of salmon production. Improvement options as well as an optimized supply chain are modelled showing greenhouse gas reduction opportunities of 40-50 % also for the best performing chains. Results can be used as a baseline for improved data collection and emission reductions. Recommendations for consumers, industry and policymakers who can facilitate and even drive development towards more sustainable salmon products are provided.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture is the fastest growing food production system in the world. Deficiencies in the quality or safety of salmon can have global repercussions. Controlling food safety aspects during production is therefore essential. Here, we investigate the state of hygiene in a salmon processing plant using next generation sequencing and classical culture-dependent methods to characterize the surface microbiota before and after cleaning and disinfection (C&D) at ten surface sampling points. Total aerobic counts revealed an average reduction in the bacterial loads of 1.1 log CFU/cm<sup>2</sup> by C&D. The highest relative abundance in the core microbiota before C&D was assigned to Acinetobacter, Mycoplasmataceae, Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae in descending order. After C&D, we observed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Pseudomonas (p < 0.05). However, variations were found between conveyors, processing machines and drains. To assess the efficacy of commercial disinfectants, we performed susceptibility assays using advanced robotic high-throughput technologies and included foodborne bacteria which may affect food safety and spoilage. These included 128 Pseudomonas isolates, 46 Aeromonas isolates and 59 Enterobacterales isolates sampled from the salmon processing plant. Generally, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the disinfectants were below the user concentration recommended by the producer for most isolates. BacTiter-Glo biofilm assays revealed that 30 min exposure to six out of eight commercial disinfectants resulted in an average reduction of relative luminescence >95 % in 59 single-species biofilms selected for screening. However, disinfection alone may not always be sufficient to eradicate biofilms completely. C&D routines must therefore be continuously assessed to maintain food safety and quality. The results from this study can contribute to understand and improve the state of hygiene in salmon processing environments.

AB  - Sea lice are amongst the most ecologically and economically damaging parasites of farmed salmonids globally. Spill-over from aquaculture can increase parasite pressure on wild fish populations, but quantifying this effect is challenging due to the relative paucity of data available on 'natural' salmonid louse burdens in the absence of aquaculture, particularly for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Here, wild Atlantic salmon and sea trout S. trutta were screened at the tidal limit of the River Tamar (UK) for the presence of sea lice. During 2013 and 2015, the prevalence of sea lice ranged from 41 (n = 361) to 60% (n = 275) and 55 (n = 882) to 58% (n = 800) in Atlantic salmon and sea trout, respectively. All sea lice collected were identified as Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Mean L. salmonis infection intensity across the study period was 5.84 (range: 1-66) in Atlantic salmon and 6.45 (range: 1-37) in sea trout. Infection intensity was positively correlated with the amount of external damage present for both fish species. Given that the fish were examined when returning to freshwater, the lice burdens obtained may represent an underestimate. Nevertheless, these data provide important baseline information on 'natural' sea louse infections in South West England, which has been proposed as a potential region for aquaculture development.

AB  - Fish farming currently accounts for approximately 46% of all consumed fish, which is a dramatic increase over the past 20 years. Problems such as mixing of farmed with wild fish, transgenic fish, disease, pollution, antibiotic resistance and regulations are addressed. These are juxtaposed with positives such as food insecurity and malnutrition alleviation and economic empowerment that occur as a result of fish farming. Socio-economic innovations and entrepreneurship through fish farming will continue to be a positive response overall to our era of global economic and financial crisis.

AB  - While rapid increase in demand for foods but limited availability of croplands has forced to adopt input-intensive farming practices to increase yield, there are serious long-term ecological implications including degradation of biodiversity. It is increasingly recognised that ensuring agricultural sustainability under the changing climatic conditions requires a change in the production system along with necessary policies and institutional arrangements. In this context, this chapter examines if climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can facilitate adaptation and mitigation practices by improving resource utilisation efficiency in India. Such an attempt has special significance as the existing studies have very limited discussions on three main aspects, viz., resource productivity, adaptation practices and mitigation strategies in a comprehensive manner. Based on insights from the existing studies, this chapter points out that CSA can potentially make significant contribution to enhancing resource productivity, adaptation practices, mitigation strategies and food security, especially among the land-constrained farmers who are highly prone to environmental shocks. In this connection, staggered trench irrigation structure has facilitated rainwater harvesting, local irrigation and livelihood generation in West Bengal. However, it is necessary to revisit the existing approaches to promotion of CSA and dissemination of information on the design of local adaptation strategies. This chapter also proposes a change in the food system from climate-sensitive to CSA through integration of technologies, institutions and policies.

AB  - Farmed fish that escape and mix with wild fish populations can have significant ecological and genetic consequences. To reduce the number of escaped fish in the wild, recapture is often attempted. Here, we review the behaviours of escapees post-escape, and how recapture success varies with escaped fish size, the size of the initial escape event and recapture methods. Success rates of fishing gears varied among species, with gill-nets and coastal barrier nets most effective for recapture of salmonids. Recapture success was strongly negatively correlated with both fish size and the number of fish escaped, regardless of species. Recapture success was universally low across all studied species (8%). Numerous tracking studies of escaped fish indicate that recapture efforts should be initiated within 24 h of an escape incident for highest recapture success. However, most large escape events are due to storms, which mean recapture efforts rarely start within this timeframe. Recapture of escaped fish is broadly ineffective in marine habitats, with rare exception. High bycatch rates during ineffective recapture attempts imply that large-scale recapture efforts should be weighed against the possibility of affecting wild fish populations negatively. We suggest three alternative approaches to reduce escapee numbers in wild habitats: (i) protect populations of predatory fish around sea-cage farms from fishing, as they prey upon smaller escapees; (ii) construct impact offset programmes to target recapture in habitats where escapees can be efficiently caught; and (iii) ensure technical standards are legislated so that fish farmers invest in preventative technologies to minimize escapes.

AB  - Production licenses with use restrictions that limit output are commonly used to regulate biological production processes. Such regulations are vulnerable to rent formation and production distortions that can end up subsidizing harmful environmental behavior. This paper develops a partial equilibrium model for a biological production process and use the model to study the impact of production quotas in Norwegian salmon aquaculture. Results suggest substantial regulatory rents capitalized in license values. Production has intensified leading to excessive stocking of fish per license, a shorting of the production period, and smaller produced fish. Our findings provide important insights for quota policies in food production, especially for cases where quotas are motivated by harmful environmental effects.

AB  - This report contributes to the understanding of how the the socio-economic contribution of Nordic fisheries/aquaculture are affected by the environment and environmental management, with focus on nitrogen. The report contains two case studies of how the socio-economic contribution of Danish/Swedish cod fishery in the Western Baltic Sea are affected by the nitrogen in the sea, and on how salmon growth rates in aquaculture in the Bokna Fiord are affected by nitrogen concentration. A Nordic workshop was held with the title: Fisheries, aquaculture and the marine environment: Environmental challenges and regulation, with focus on nitrogen. The finding of the case studies was presented at the workshop, together with presentations made by invited speakers on the role of nutrients and their management for Nordic fisheries/aquaculture. The discussion at the workshop is summarized in this report.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The seafood sector is facing difficulties to meet the increasing demand for product greenhouse gas emission (GHG) assessments. We quantified GHGs of important seafood products of Norway, the world's second largest seafood exporter. We present results and improvement options for products of farmed salmon and wild‐caught shrimp, king crab, cod, and herring, followed to their dominating markets, based on detailed data for 2017. To enable more frequent monitoring, without engaging in a full assessment, we then suggest a simplified approach, focusing on the main drivers of production‐related emissions. The simplified approach is used to analyze temporal trends from 2007–2017 for fisheries and 1990–2017 for salmon aquaculture. Finally, the simplified approach was compared to the comprehensive assessment for 2017 to define species‐specific upscaling factors. Results show that salmon and crustacean products in 2017 caused higher emissions than cod and herring products, with feed and fuel use being the main emission drivers, whereas airfreighted products had the highest emissions of all products. Large improvement potential from average to best performers within each production system exists. The simplified approach shows that the fuel‐use intensity of Norwegian fisheries has increased by almost 50% for shrimp over the past decade whereas it has decreased for fish by 20% for demersal species such as cod and 5–10% for pelagic species such as herring. Feed‐related emissions for salmon, on the other hand, have increased by almost 30% during the same period, because of an increasing feed conversion ratio and increased inclusion of emission‐intensive feed inputs.</jats:p>

AB  - Surface environment modification is a potential parasite control strategy in Atlantic salmon sea-cage farming. For instance, a temporary low salinity surface layer in commercial-scale snorkel sea-cages has coincided with reduced amoebic gill disease (AGD) levels after an outbreak. We tested if a permanent freshwater (FW) surface layer in snorkel sea-cages would lower AGD and salmon lice levels of stock relative to snorkel cages with seawater (SW) only and standard production cages with no snorkels. Triplicate cages of each type with 2000 post-smolts were monitored in autumn to winter for 8 wk and sampled 4 times. Lower proportions of individuals with elevated AGD-related gill scores were registered in SW and FW snorkel cages compared to standard cages; however, these proportions did not differ between SW and FW snorkel cages. Individuals positive for AGD-causing Paramoeba perurans were reduced by 65% in FW snorkel relative to standard cages, but values were similar between SW snorkel cages and other types. While total lice burdens were reduced by 38% in SW snorkel compared to standard cages, they were unchanged between FW snorkel and other cage types. Fish welfare and growth were unaffected by cage type. Surface activity was detected in all cages; however, more surface jumps were recorded in standard than snorkel cages. Overall, fish in FW snorkel cages appeared to reside too little in freshwater to consistently reduce AGD levels and salmon lice compared to SW snorkel cages. Further work should test behavioural and environmental manipulations aimed at increasing freshwater or low salinity surface layer use.

AB  - The escape of fish from aquaculture is perceived as a threat to wild fish populations. The escapes problem is largely caused by technical and operational failures of fish farming equipment. In Norway, 3.93 million Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, 0.98 million rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and 1.05 million Atlantic cod Gadus morhua escaped from 2001 to 2009. Salmonids primarily escape after structural failures of containment equipment, while a far greater percentage of cod than salmon escape through holes in the nets. Correlative evidence suggests that after the Norwegian technical standard (NS 9415) for sea-cage farms took effect in 2004, the total number of escaped Atlantic salmon declined from >600 000 (2001 to 2006) to <200 000 fish yr -1 (2007 to 2009), despite the total number of salmon held in sea-cages increasing by 44% during this period. No similar decrease in escaped cod has occurred, suggesting that other measures, such as improved netting materials for sea-cages, are required. In addition to escaping as juveniles or adults, cod may reproduce in sea- cages, and thus fertilised eggs escape to the environment. The ecological effects of 'escape through spawning' are unclear, and methods to inhibit escape by this mechanism are being explored. To pre- vent escapes of juvenile and adult fish as sea-cage aquaculture industries develop, we recommend that policy-makers implement a 5 component strategy: (1) establish mandatory reporting of all escape incidents; (2) establish a mechanism to analyse and learn from the mandatory reporting; (3) conduct mandatory, rapid, technical assessments to determine the causes of escape incidents involving more than 10 000 fish; (4) introduce a technical standard for sea-cage aquaculture equipment coupled with an independent mechanism to enforce the standard; and (5) conduct mandatory training of fish farm staff in escape-critical operations and techniques.

AB  - The price of farmed Atlantic salmon from Norway has increased in recent years. This new regime follows several years of consistently falling prices. At the same time price volatility has increased substantially. This article models the volatility of salmon prices and establishes empirically that volatility is on an increasing trend. Further empirical analysis suggests that the volatility trend is largely accounted for by the common trend in other food prices relevant to salmon, including meats, cereals, oils and fish meal observed in recent years. Other potentially contributing factors to volatility are also discussed. This includes the role of the 2005 maximum total allowable biomass restriction, the 2006 introduction of the Fish Pool ASA futures market for salmon, the Chilean Salmon crisis and the increasing use of bilateral contracts.

AB  - Classifying habitat patches as sources or sinks and determining metapopulation persistence requires coupling connectivity between habitat patches with local demographic rates. While methods to calculate sources, sinks, and metapopulation persistence exist for discrete-time models, there is no method that is consistent across modeling frameworks. In this paper, we show how next-generation matrices, originally popularized in epidemiology to calculate new infections after one generation, can be used in an ecological context to calculate sources and sinks as well as metapopulation persistence in marine metapopulations. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we construct a next-generation matrix for a network of sea lice populations on salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago, BC, an intensive salmon farming region on the west coast of Canada where certain salmon farms are currently being removed under an agreement between local First Nations and the provincial government. The column sums of the next-generation matrix can determine if a habitat patch is a source or a sink and the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix can determine the persistence of the metapopulation. With respect to salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago, we identify the salmon farms which are acting as the largest sources of sea lice and show that in this region the most productive sea lice populations are also the most connected. The farms which are the largest sources of sea lice have not yet been removed from the Broughton Archipelago, and warming temperatures could lead to increased sea louse growth. Calculating sources, sinks, and persistence in marine metapopulations using the next-generation matrix is biologically intuitive, mathematically equivalent to previous methods, and consistent across different modeling frameworks.

AB  - Recently, we showed that Atlantic salmon vaccinated against Piscirickettsia salmonis lose their protection upon coinfection with Caligus rogercresseyi (sea lice). However, the causes of the overriding effect of C. rogercresseyi infection have not been elucidated, and the molecular basis of the cellular and humoral immune responses upon C. rogercresseyi infection has not been described for vaccinated salmon. Therefore, we studied changes in the transcription of immune genes in vaccinated Atlantic salmon that were experimentally challenged by co-infecting them with C. rogercresseyi and P. salmonis. In general, coinfection treatments showed immune gene expression similar to treatments with a single P. salmonis infection, showing a decreased cellular response. However, a high variance was found between individual fish in the case of crucial cellular immune genes, with a few fish reacting overwhelmingly highly compared to the majority. This supports our previous findings on vaccination response variation and reinforces the idea that vaccination failures in the field might be caused by an overwhelming amount of vaccinated fish that display a deficient immune response to the infection.

               <jats:p>Chronically high infestation of salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) questions the sustainability of the Norwegian Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture industry. The confinement of millions of hosts, within hundreds of farms with overlapping larval dispersal kernels create the structure for extremely persistent parasite meta-populations. However, the processes regulating the temporal variation in cross-contamination of pelagic salmon louse stages among farms (i.e. connectivity), a vital process driving louse population dynamics, are not well described. Here, we employ a data driven biophysical dispersal model that reproduces three-and-a-half years of production histories of 132 salmon farms in western Norway and quantifies the connectivity of infective pelagic lice stages among the farms with the ocean currents. We show that although the complex geography of western Norwegian fjords governs the long-term topology of the connectivity network, there was a strong seasonal component to network fragmentation. The main de-structuring agent was the delayed infectivity of the pelagic lice stages at cooler temperatures increasing dispersal distances, enhanced by occasional large scale wind forcing events. Coordinated fallowing strategies and de-lousing treatments only played a marginal role in network fragmentation, suggesting that novel lice restraining strategies that consider the environmentally sensitive transport distances must be developed to successfully break up the connectivity network.</jats:p>

Farms varied in water surface areas for production, reservoirs, canals, and settling basins; in pond size and depth; and in water management, stocking density, feeding rate, amendment input, aeration rate, crop duration, and crops per year. Production of L. vannamei averaged 17.3 and 10.9 m.t./ha/yr, and feed conversion ratio averaged 1.49 and 1.33 in Thailand and Vietnam, respectively. On average, production of 1 m.t. of L. vannamei required 0.58 ha land, 5,400 m3 water, 60 GJ energy, and 1218 kg wildfish in Thailand and 1.76 ha land, 15,100 m3 water, 33.7 GJ energy, and 1264 kg wildfish in Vietnam. Resource use per metric ton of shrimp declined with greater production intensity. In Thailand, P. monodon was produced at 0.2–0.4 m.t./ha/yr, with no inputs but water and postlarvae. In Vietnam, P. monodon production averaged 3.60 m.t./ha/yr. Production of 1 m.t. of P. monodon required 0.80 ha land, 36,000 m3 water, 47.8 GJ energy, and 1180 kg wildfish, and resource use per ton production declined with increasing production intensity.

AB  - The consumption of fish and fish-related products is increasing. Due to improved welfare and suggested health benefits, consumers are now eating more fish. In 2008, global fisheries supplied the world with about 142 million tons of fish, of which 115 million tons was used as human food, which is an all-time high (FAO, 2010. The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture. FAO, Rome, Italy). Fish for consumption can be harvested directly from the wild (capture fisheries), but a growing proportion of the fish comes from worldwide aquaculture (FAO, 2010). As a result, there is an increased need for feed for this growing industry. Fish need feed with high levels of protein and energy. Traditionally, for carnivorous or omnivorous fish, these are provided mainly as fish meal and fish oil which are however finite resources and alternative ingredients are needed. Any change in composition is not trivial because fish feed pellets need to fulfil strict technological requirements. When feeding to salmon, the pellet should sink slowly. In addition, the porosity of the pellet directly after extrusion should be such that it can capture sufficient oil. The pellets should not break or produce dust during transport and further handling. This makes the production of feed pellets a delicate process in which the techno-functional properties of the raw materials play an important role. It is not a simple matter to conclude that plant proteins are more sustainable per se if all the renewable and nonrenewable resources and waste emissions related to the production of these ingredients are taken into account. For example, the use of plant-based ingredients might require additional water during extrusion leading to increased drying costs. This thesis describes the relationships between the techno-functional properties of protein-rich ingredients and processing. Criteria have been developed for the use of plant-based materials in existing fish feed processes to allow the production of feed pellets that meet all the product requirements. Feed sustainability is assessed using three different methodologies and sustainable feed compositions are proposed. Future trends in the development of sustainable feeds are described based on the insights obtained from this thesis. These include the use of plant proteins that contribute to a more intensified process with the ultimate goal of no drying and future exploration of the use of algae-derived products with special focus on the replacement of fish oil with algae oil.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Classifying habitat patches as sources or sinks and determining metapopulation persistence requires coupling connectivity between habitat patches with local demographic rates. In this paper we show how next-generation matrices, originally popularized in epidemiology to calculate new infections after one generation, can be used in an ecological context to couple connectivity with local demography to calculate sources and sinks as well as metapopulation persistence in marine metapopulations. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we construct a next-generation matrix for a network of sea lice populations on salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago, BC, an intensive salmon farming region on the west coast of Canada where certain salmon farms are currently being removed under an agreement between local First Nations and the provincial government. We identify the salmon farms which are acting as the largest sources of sea lice and show that in this region the most productive sea lice populations are also the most connected. We find that the farms which are the largest sources of sea lice have not yet been removed from the Broughton Archipelago, and that warming temperatures could lead to increased sea louse growth.</jats:p>

AB  - Throughout the Pacific Northwest (northern California, Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and the Columbia Basin portion of British Columbia), many wild salmon stocks (a group of interbreeding individuals that is roughly equivalent to a “population”) have declined and some have disappeared. Substantial efforts have been made to restore some runs of wild salmon, but few have shown much success. Society's failure to restore wild salmon is a policy conundrum characterized by: (1) claims by a strong majority to be supportive of restoring wild salmon runs; (2) competing societal priorities which are at least partially mutually exclusive; (3) the region's rapidly growing human population and its pressure on all natural resources (including salmon and their habitats); (4) entrenched policy stances in the salmon restoration debate, usually supported by established bureaucracies; (5) society's expectation that experts should be able to solve the salmon problem by using a technological scheme and without massive cultural o...

AB  - Research into Piscirickettsia salmonis biofilms on materials commonly used in salmon farming is crucial for understanding its persistence and virulence. We used the CDC Biofilm Reactor to investigate P. salmonis (LF-89 and EM-90) biofilm formation on Nylon, Stainless steel (316L), Polycarbonate and High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) surfaces. After 144 h of biofilm visualization by scanning confocal laser microscopy under batch growth conditions, Nylon coupons generated the greatest biofilm formation and coverage compared to Stainless steel (316L), Polycarbonate and HDPE. Additionally, P. salmonis biofilm formation on Nylon was significantly greater (p ≤ .01) than Stainless steel (316L), Polycarbonate and HDPE at 288 h. We used Nylon coupons to determine the kinetic parameters of the planktonic and biofilm phases of P. salmonis. The two strains had similar latencies in the planktonic phase; however, LF-89 maximum growth was 2.5 orders of magnitude higher (Log cell ml<sup>-1</sup> ). Additionally, LF-89 had a specified growth rate (µmax) of 0.0177 ± 0.006 h<sup>-1</sup> and a generation time of 39.2 h. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the biofilm formation by P. salmonis and elucidates the impact of the biofilm on aquaculture systems.

               <jats:p>Turkey's Mediterranean aquaculture industry is the world leader in European seabass aquaculture and the European leader in meagre aquaculture. In this study, carbon footprint (CF) values of four partial harvests of European seabass in earthen pond aquaculture (EPES) and meagre in earthen pond aquaculture (EPM) were determined. The average values of total CF expended for EPES and EPM, which reached a final harvest weight of approximately 1,500 g in 1,061 and 633 days were 3.38 and 2.26 kg CO2e kg−1, respectively. The lowest and highest rates of CF expended on consumed compound diet (CFCD) were 63.92 and 65.59% in EPES, and 62.44 and 66.70% in EPM, respectively. The rates of CF general management were 32.0 and 33.57% in EPES and 30.98 and 34.98% in EPM, respectively. Against this high proportion of the compound diet, the second highest value was the lowest and highest proportion of partial harvests of electricity, 28.20 and 29.59% in EPES and 27.09 and 30.51% in EPM, respectively. CF input and CF output per kg values of meagre were decreased with increasing weight, therefore meagre can be defined as a species with high global food security and resilience against climate change.</jats:p>

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), obtained from rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) intestine, were cultured in MRS medium and probiotic candidates. Concurrently, producers of elemental selenium nanoparticles (Se<sup>0</sup>Nps) were selected. Probiotic candidates were subjected to morphological characterization and the following tests: antibacterial activity, antibiotic susceptibility, hemolytic activity, catalase, hydrophobicity, viability at low pH, and tolerance to bile salts. Two LAB strains (S4 and S14) satisfied the characteristics of potential probiotics, but only strain S14 reduced selenite to biosynthesize Se<sup>0</sup>Nps. S14 strain was identified, by 16S rDNA analysis, as <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>. Electron microscopy showed Se<sup>0</sup>Nps on the surface of S14 cells. Rainbow trout diet was supplemented (10<sup>8</sup> CFU g<sup>-1</sup> feed) with Se<sup>0</sup>Nps-enriched <i>L. plantarum</i> S14 (LABS14-Se<sup>0</sup>Nps) or <i>L. plantarum</i> S14 alone (LABS14) for 30 days. At days 0, 15, and 30, samples (blood, liver, and dorsal muscle) were obtained from both groups, plus controls lacking diet supplementation. Fish receiving LABS14-Se<sup>0</sup>Nps for 30 days improved respiratory burst and plasmatic lysozyme, (innate immune response) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (oxidative status) activities and productive parameters when compared to controls. The same parameters also improved when compared to fish receiving LABS14, but significant only for plasmatic and muscle GPX. Therefore, Se<sup>0</sup>Nps-enriched <i>L. plantarum</i> S14 may be a promising alternative for rainbow trout nutritional supplementation.

AB  - System analysis was performed to gain an overview of key environmental challenges and pinpoint hotspots causing environmental impacts in three European food supply chains. An overview was obtained based on a review on LCA studies for beef, dairy, orange juice and aquaculture food supply chains. Similarities of the main environmental impacts were identified to rationalize and justify the selection of key performance indicators chosen for a simplified web based LCA tool developed within the EC funded project SENSE (FP7). Life Cycle Assessment methodology covered many of the key challenges identified but will not be sufficient to address all environmental impacts generated from the food supply chains. Especially for aquaculture impacts that are not taken into account with LCA are i.e. nutrient and organic matter releases, impacts associated with feed provision, diseases introduction, escapes, and changed usage of coastal areas. In agriculture land use and biodiversity are issues not well covered.

AB  - Food availability can influence the nutritional and social dynamics within and among species. Our investigation focused on grizzly and black bears in coastal British Columbia, Canada, where recent and dramatic declines in their primary prey (salmon) raise concerns about potentially negative effects on bear physiology. We examined how salmon availability relates to stress and reproductive hormones in coastal grizzly (n = 69) and black bears (n = 68) using cortisol and testosterone. In hair samples from genotyped individuals, we quantified salmon consumption using stable isotope analysis and hormone levels by enzyme immu noassay. To estimate the salmon biomass available to each bear, we developed a spatially explicit approach based on typical bear home-range sizes. Next, we compared the relative importance of salmon consumption and salmon availability on hormone levels in male bears using an information theoretical approach. Cortisol in grizzly bears was higher in individuals that consumed less salmon, possibly reflecting nutritional stress. In black bears, cortisol was better predicted by salmon availability than salmon consumption; specifically, individuals in areas and years with low salmon availability showed higher cortisol levels. This indicates that cortisol in black bears is more strongly influenced by the socially competitive environment mediated by salmon availability than by nutritional requirements. In both species, testosterone generally decreased with increasing salmon availability, possibly reflecting a less competitive environment when salmon were abundant. Differences between species could relate to different nutritional requirements, social densities and competitive behaviour and/or habitat use. We present a conceptual model to inform further investigations in this and other systems. Our approach, which combines data on multiple hormones with dietary and spatial information corresponding to the year of hair growth, provides a promising tool for evaluating the responses of a broad spectrum of wildlife to changes in food availability or other environmental conditions.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Chilean Blue Patagonia is an essential space for marine life and a global center of the aquaculture industry. Over the last few years, several socio‐environmental crises and conflicts have marked its development, highlighting the impacts of salmon farming on marine habitats and the livelihoods of local communities. To face this critical scenario, the indigenous peoples have created the Indigenous Marine Areas (ECMPO), a protection figure which safeguards their livelihoods and preserves the ecosystems that sustain them. Based on ethnographic information, the work analyzes care practices and strategies of indigenous peoples, the vital paths of abundance, health and illness of the livelihoods, the other‐than‐human agencies' roles in the production of care narratives and behaviors, and the territorial dynamics of the ECMPOs.</jats:p>

AB  - This study investigates the effects of changes in flow speed and angle of attack on drag and lift forces on nets with bending stiffness. Today most fish cage nets are made from nylon, but new cage materials are proposed in order to improve the stability of cages in currents and waves, to reduce biofouling, prevent escapes, and to secure fish from predator attacks. The use of some of these materials leads to nets with bending stiffness in at least one direction. However, not much is known about the performance of such nets in currents and waves. In this study, three different nets with bending stiffness were tested together with nylon nets. Net panels were subjected to different flow speeds at different angles between flow direction and net plane, and the forces on the nets were measured with a multi-axis force/torque sensor system. Based on the experiments, drag, and lift coefficients were determined for the different net materials and compared to existing theory with which they are in reasonably good agreement for the nets with low solidity. However, for nets with higher solidity the results are significantly lower than the drag and lift coefficients provided other authors. Also, the change of drag coefficient with changing flow speed and angle of attack was different for a monofilament and a multifilament net with similar solidity and aperture form and size. These differences may partly be due to differences in twine structures and net construction between the monofilament and multifilament net and between nets used by other authors and in the present study.

AB  - A proportion of farmed salmon in seawater show a behaviorally inhibited, growth stunted profile known as a depression-like state (DLS). These DLS fish are characterized by chronically elevated serotonergic signaling and blood plasma cortisol levels and the inability to react further to acute stress, which is suggestive of chronic stress. In this study, we characterize the neuroendocrine profile of growth stunted freshwater parr and confirm that they show a DLS-like neuroendocrine profile with a blunted cortisol response and no serotonergic increase in response to acute stress. Furthermore, we attempted to reverse this DLS-like profile through pharmacological manipulation of the serotonin (5-HT) system with buspirone, an anxiolytic medication that acts as a serotonin receptor agonist (i.e., decreases serotonergic signaling). We found that while buspirone decreases anxiolytic-type behavior in healthy fish, no quantifiable behavioral change was found in DLS-like fish. However, there was a physiological effect of diminished basal serotonergic signaling. This suggests that at the physiological level, buspirone appears to reverse the neuroendocrine DLS profile. With a deeper understanding of what causes DLS profiles and growth stunting in juvenile fish, steps can be taken in terms of husbandry to prevent repeated stressors and the formation of the DLS profile, potentially reducing losses in aquaculture due to chronic stress.

AB  - Life cycle assessment is used in this study to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of producing gilthead seabream in an offshore sea farm exposed to storms in the Spanish Mediterranean Sea. The farming methods used can be considered as “basic” since no centralized or automatic food distribution system exists and there is no control system. This study aims to identify the main hotspots under these conditions and to propose and compare viable alternatives to them. Contribution analysis found that the component of the system with the greatest potential environmental impact (48% of the overall impact) was fish feed, especially the raw material used. Other contributory factors were the fuel consumed by the vessels operating in the farm (35%), the dumping of N and P in the environment due to the metabolism of the fish (12%), the cages and their anchorage system (5%). A sensitivity analysis showed that a significant reduction in potential environmental impact can be achieved by increasing feeding efficiency. Feed formulation in raw materials is also an important factor and could serve to diminish overall adverse effects. A balance needs to be found between productive performance (growth, survival and feed conversion rate), feed price and its influence on production costs and the overall environmental consequences.

AB  - Abstract Fish feed waste enhancement of the particulate food supply and performance of mussels Mytilus edulis suspended near salmon cages at an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) site was assessed using a multi-indicator approach. Dietary indicators included bulk measurements of seston quantity and nutritional quality, proximate analysis (PA), fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope (SI) composition. Mussel tissue indicators consisted of PA and FA composition. Mussel performance was assessed from physiological integrations (scope for growth, SFG), growth efficiency (K 2 ) and condition index (CI). All measurements were made over 2 days at a commercial IMTA farm and a monoculture mussel farm in the Bay of Fundy (Canada). Significant differences detected in seston quantity and quality were within the range of natural spatial variability. The SFG of IMTA mussels was lower (28.71 J h −1 ) than monoculture mussels (38.71 J h −1 ) and reflected site differences in natural food availability and composition that affected absorption rate. PA of mussel organs didn't reflect a significant fish feed contribution to the mussel diet. However, dietary enhancement and assimilation of fish feed waste was demonstrated by significantly higher levels of feed FA biomarkers 20:1ω9, 18:2ω6, 18:1ω9 and low ω3/ω6 ratio in seston, mussel tissues and feces at the IMTA site than at the mussel farm. SI (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) in seston and mussel feces significantly differed among sites and IMTA mussels had significantly higher CI (21%) than monoculture individuals (16%). It was concluded that bulk indicators of the diet, short-term physiological integrations, and PA of mussel tissues have a limited capacity to detect dietary enhancement at IMTA sites. FA and SI tracers of fish feed waste were shown to be more sensitive for detecting the low-levels of diet enhancement within the large range of natural seston variation.

AB  - Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem accounting for the reduction or in some cases absence of drugs effectiveness normally used in infections treatment. In the light of the even more spread ability of microbials to develop resistance, there is an urgent necessity to find novel and alternative routes to fight infections. Natural compounds or extracts can be a valid alternative either as monotherapy or as adjuvant in order to improve the effectiveness of the failing drugs. Areas covered: This review provides a comprehensive update (2018-2020) on the development state of innovative antimicrobial agents based on natural compounds and extracts, also describing their compositions, methods of production and use, mechanism of action, along with anti-microbial data when available. Expert opinion: Owing to the pivotal role that natural compounds often cover in the finding of novel drugs, their in-depth analysis could pave the way to the discovery of new antimicrobial agents. Most of the alternative approaches reported in this short review were validated through in vitro and in vivo (animal as well as human) models. The employment of natural derived compounds and extracts, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobial drugs, as antimicrobial agents could represent an important achievement to challenge pathogens resistant mechanisms.

AB  - Genetic analyses of two unknown but putative Atlantic salmon Salmo salar captured in the Copper River drainage, Alaska, demonstrated the need for validation of morphologically unusual fishes. Mitochondrial DNA sequences (control region and cytochrome b) and data from two nuclear genes [first internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) sequence and growth hormone (GH1) amplification product] indicated that the fish caught in fresh water on the Martin River was a coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, while the other fish caught in the intertidal zone of the Copper River delta near Grass Island was an Atlantic salmon. Determination of unusual or cryptic fish based on limited physical characteristics and expected seasonal spawning run timing will add to the controversy over farmed Atlantic salmon and their potential effects on native Pacific species. It is clear that determination of all putative collections of Atlantic salmon found in Pacific waters requires validation. Due to uncertainty of fish identification in the field using plastic morphometric characters, it is recommended that genetic analyses be part of the validation process.

AB  - Mucosal vaccination, which has the potential to induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses, is considered the most suitable method of preventing infectious diseases in farmed fish. Aeromonas veronii and Edwardsiella ictaluri are two pathogenic bacteria found in yellow catfish and often infect the fish through mucosal surfaces. Delivery of a bivalent inactivated vaccine by injection has been shown to induce a strong systemic immune response against both bacterial infections. However, mucosal immune responses and protective efficiency induced by this inactivated vaccine administrated via immersion are yet to be investigated. We developed a bivalent vaccine containing formalin-inactivated A. veronii and E. ictaluri and evaluated the immune response in yellow catfish after immersion vaccination using body fluids biochemistry indices, agglutinating antibody titers, and the expression level of immune-related genes in the skin, gills, spleen, and head kidney. The activities of innate immune-related enzymes and specific agglutination antibody titers in body fluids, as well as the expression of innate and adaptive immune-related genes in both the mucosal and systemic tissues of vaccinated fish, were significantly higher than that in control fish. Next, we assessed the protective efficacy by a challenge model of virulent strains of E. ictaluri and A. veronii. The relative survival percent of vaccinated fish was 80% and 87% after challenging fish with E. ictaluri and A. veronii, respectively, which was higher than unvaccinated control fish (43% and 57%). These results confirm that the bivalent inactivated vaccine administered via immersion induces a strong mucosal immune response and confers good protection against both E. ictaluri and A. veronii. Our results also reinforce the notion that immersion vaccination could stimulate both mucosal and systemic immunity contributing to protection against pathogens.

AB  - Due to increasing demand for salmon and environmental barriers preventing expansion in established sites, salmon farmers seek to move or expand their production to more exposed sites. In this study we investigate the effects of strong currents and waves on the behaviour of salmon and how they choose to use the space available to them. Using video cameras and echo sounders, we show that fish prefer to use the entire water

column, narrowing their range only as a response to cage deformation, waves, or daylight. Conversely, fish show strong horizontal preference, mostly occupying the portions of the cage exposed to currents. Additionally, waves cause salmon to move away from the sides of the cage. Even when strong currents and waves decrease the amount of available space, salmon choose to occupy the more exposed part of the cage.

This indicates that at least with good water exchange, the high biomass caused by limited vertical space is not so aversive that salmon choose to move to less desirable areas of the cage. However, the dispersal throughout the entire available water column indicates that keeping the cone portion of the cage available in strong currents would be beneficial to salmon welfare.

AB  - <jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold>Ecohistories of aquaculture suggest that aquaculture is a natural part of human development throughout history and that modern, industrial aquaculture could strengthen its social and ecological roots by articulating its evolution along a sustainability trajectory
 and by adopting fully the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) ecosystems approach to aquaculture (EAA; &lt;xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121"&gt;Soto et al., 2008&lt;/xref&gt;). The EAA creates a new code for global aquaculture development, combining into one common framework the two most
 important social‐ecological trajectories for global aquaculture—aquaculture for the world’s rich and aquaculture for the world’s poor. Knowledge of the rich archeology and anthropology of aquaculture connects this FAO code to antiquity, creating a single development
 pathway for aquaculture throughout human history. Without widespread adoption of an EAA, &lt;xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50"&gt;FAO (2009)&lt;/xref&gt; projections of aquaculture development over the next 30 years may provide a far too optimistic scenario for its global growth. In this regard,
 aquaculture over the last 20 years has been criticized as lacking adequate attention and investment in developing grassroots, democratic, extension processes to engage a broader group of stakeholders to evolve the “blue revolution.” As an example, there has been a failure of fisheries
 and aquaculture to plan together to ensure sustainable supplies of seafood—the world’s most valuable proteins for human health—for seafood-eating peoples. Nonfed aquaculture (seaweeds, shellfish) has received worldwide attention for its rapid movement toward greater sustainability,
 which has led to more widespread social acceptance. For fed aquaculture, recent trends analyses have suggested that aquaculture is turning from the ocean to land-based agriculture to provide its protein feeds and oils. As such, more sophisticated, ecologically planned and designed “aquaculture
 ecosystems” will become more widespread because they better fit the social‐ecological context of both rich and poor countries. Ecological aquaculture provides the basis for developing a new social contract for aquaculture that is inclusive of all stakeholders and decision makers
 in fisheries, agriculture, and ecosystems conservation and restoration.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As the harvesting of fish through commercial fisheries becomes both harder and less economically viable, the world is becoming increasingly dependent on aquaculture to provide fish for human consumption. The closely related activity of stock enhancement, whereby large numbers of fish are reared and then released, is a common practice aimed at increasing the numbers of fish in rivers and along coasts. Aquaculture and stock enhancement practices raise a number of welfare and conservation issues both for fish that are reared within captivity, and for the local populations and habitats that are influenced by fish-rearing activities. In this review, we illustrate how fish farms and hatcheries have directly affected fish welfare. Examples cover on-farm fish husbandry and healthcare, the interactions between farmed and wild fish, and survival of fish released for stock enhancement. These aspects are often intertwined with important conservation issues. Thus, we also review direct effects that aquaculture-generated pollution can have on local habitats, issues associated with feeding reared fish, and problems created by alien fish (either escapees or intentionally released fish). While awareness of fish welfare is certainly growing, so is the rate at which fish are reared. There is, therefore, a pressing need to understand the welfare and conservation issues that are affected by aquaculture and stock enhancement.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract This paper evaluates the optimal timing to undertake an investment in a post-smolt production facility under both profit and technology uncertainty, using a real options approach. Two multi-factor stochastic models are developed to distinguish between the technological innovations that reduce the investment cost and increase the efficiency of the production process. The results indicate that by relying on traditional capital budgeting methods the salmon farming companies may undervalue sensible investment opportunities, such as post-smolt production. Additionally, it is show that the investment strategy of the salmon farming company is greatly influenced by the way the benefits of the technological innovations affect the firm. A farmer has stronger incentives to delay investment when the expected benefits of technological innovations are associated with the future investment cost reduction.

AB  - Circulation in estuaries is typically considered to be driven by horizontal density gradients, called gravitational circulation, but can be modified by other forcing such as the wind. Studies have shown that wind influence can either augment or counteract density-driven residual flows in estuaries, but the temporal and spatial extent of this influence remains unknown, particularly in deep and highly stratified fjords. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the seasonal variability in residual circulation, wind forcing, and stratification in an extensive fjord and channel system in Chilean Patagonia. Observations of current velocity and wind are supplemented by atmospheric and hydrodynamic circulation models in the Moraleda Channel, a system that connects the fjord system of Northern Patagonia to the Pacific Ocean. Results show a marked seasonality, given that the surface outflow is reversed by wind forcing during the winter, a season characterized by strong southward (up-channel) winds. This produces a near-surface flow directed up-channel in the upper ∼40 m of the water column, in opposition to the horizontal pressure gradient. Cross-channel transects revealed that the vertical structure of the along-channel residual velocity was three-layer during the winter. The near-surface (<50 m) along-channel current on the eastern side of the channel followed the wind direction (southward). Between 50 and 100 m depth the flow was out-channel and below 100 m depth the flow was again in-channel. On the western side, the along-channel residual flow was two-layer, with near surface flow directed northward (against the wind) with a return flow below (deeper than 50 m). During the spring, northward (out-channel) winds dominated and the vertical structure of the along-channel residual velocity was two-layer, augmenting the horizontal pressure gradient, which stabilized the water column, enhancing stratification, inhibiting mixing and elevated gravitational circulation.

AB  - <jats:p>This review focuses on the crucial role of aquatic ecosystems in preserving biodiversity and the biosphere, as well as the connection between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and these ecosystems. It provides an in-depth analysis of the link between ecological well-being and public health, helping readers understand this complex subject. Aquatic ecosystems are essential for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance. Additionally, they act as primary reservoirs and pathways for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These ecosystems risk antibiotic contamination through various sources, such as the release of antibiotics from animal and human waste, improper disposal of unused medications, and pharmaceutical industry waste management practices. The presence of antibiotic residues in these environments significantly speeds up the development of bacterial resistance. The global prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is evident in freshwater bodies, tributaries, sewage waters, and wastewater treatment facilities. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is now a significant public health threat, compromising the effectiveness of many previously successful treatments against various pathogens. One notable and alarming aspect of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is its rapid development, often occurring within 5–10 years after introducing antimicrobial drugs to the market. This acceleration is closely tied to bacteria’s ability to thrive and adapt in the presence of antimicrobial agents and their residues in the environment. The implications of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) include treatment failures with long-term effects and a continuous increase in healthcare costs. This review comprehensively examines the intricate relationship between aquatic habitats, antibiotics, and the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It emphasizes the critical role of these ecosystems in preserving ecological diversity. It raises awareness about AMR’s urgent public health issue, laying a foundation for understanding its extensive consequences.</jats:p>

AB  - To remain within the limits of the planetary boundaries and address increasing disease rates due to poor eating habits, there needs to be a major shift in dietary patterns. The composition of an optimal diet changes depending on location, season, and personalized dietary needs. We develop a methodology to build a 500+ food item, nutrient, and environmental impact database specific to a given country and month, which includes several life cycle stages of a food item and calculates impacts depending on from where the item is sourced. This database is then used to develop a detailed and personalized, healthful, low impact diet by using linear optimization. We applied this methodology to several case studies to compare what low impact diets would look like depending on country (Switzerland vs. Spain), season (August vs. February), sex, the inclusion of dietary supplements, and for different diet types and impact categories (climate change and biodiversity loss). Results indicate that, although optimized diets are similar, there are marked differences in the detailed composition depending on country, season, and impact considered, especially regarding legume choice. The lowest impact diet contained local and imported foods as well as fish. Vegan diets had the lowest impact only when incorporating a supplement to meet nutrient needs. We developed a tool to be used for personalized diet composition assessments for any global geographical location and season. We anticipate this work to be useful for developing country‐ and season‐specific dietary guidelines and for consumers hoping to reduce their own personal impacts.

AB  - Aquaculture has been identified as a food sector with potential to provide protein and essential micronutrients to a growing global population, with salmon aquaculture often viewed as a leader in innovation and adoption of new technologies. Despite a broad range of negative externalities in salmon aquaculture, sea lice infestations remain the most harmful of environmental issues within the industry. In response to these challenges and driven by the need for a higher degree of control over the production conditions, salmon producers in Norway have been investing in new technologies that are often perceived as the last resort for sea lice abatement. The challenge is to design a regulatory regime that encourages innovation toward a sustainable mix of production technologies in the future. In this paper, we propose to use feed-in tariffs (FITs), a dynamic Pigouvian subsidy, as a regulatory instrument that can promote investments in abatement technologies by the salmon farming industry. We ground our discussion of FITs for aquaculture in experiences from the renewable energy sector in Spain and Germany.

AB  - The proliferation of salmon lice is one of the most challenging problems in salmon farming, seriously affecting the welfare of both farmed and wild salmonids. The detection of salmon lice in seawater, especially in the (pre-) infectious stage, supports the accurate management of salmon lice proliferation. Methods for detecting salmon lice in seawater to date involve traditional light and fluorescence microscopy and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods. However, these methods require sample pre-processing and are laborious and time-consuming, rendering them difficult to apply for the task of continuous, rapid salmon lice detection in large water volumes. This study aims to develop a rapid and easy-to-use method for the detection of salmon lice in seawater. A novel approach was introduced for the detection of salmon lice at different larval stages in seawater by leveraging machine learning. A setup for the rapid acquisition of images of salmon lice in seawater was developed, and a dataset comprising 8316 images encompassing salmon lice "Nauplius Live," "Nauplius Shell" and "Copepodite" was created. Then 16 object detection models including one- and two-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN-) based models and Transformer-based models were trained, tested, and compared on this comprehensive dataset. RT-DETR showed the best performance among all models tested with a precision of 0.972 and a recall of 0.978. The YOLO series models, except for YOLOv3, showcased remarkable inference speeds (ranging from 152 to 416 frames per second) while maintaining high precision (ranging from 0.968 to 0.977) and recall (ranging from 0.964 to 0.970). To our knowledge, this is the first time machine learning has been applied to the task of rapidly detecting salmon louse larvae at different stages in seawater samples. The results demonstrate that the machine learning approaches can achieve rapid easy-to-use and cost-effective detection of salmon lice in seawater. In the future, this study has the potential for application in measuring salmon louse larvae numbers in aquatic environments, supporting the enhancement of the welfare of both farmed and wild salmon.

AB  - <jats:p><jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic> as one of the main pathogens of shellfish diseases can cause serious human seafoodborne gastroenteritis and even death. In this study, we analyzed the bacterial communities from the clam, and compared the resistance phenotypes and genotypes of <jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic> spp. from <jats:italic>Meretrix meretrix</jats:italic> at different growth stages. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed the predominance of <jats:italic>Proteobacteria</jats:italic> (50%) in the bacterial community and <jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic> was one of the dominant genera in the clam hepatopancreas in the summer. <jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic> abundance in <jats:italic>Meretrix meretrix</jats:italic> positively correlated with the water temperature (p&amp;lt;0.05). A total of 73 <jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic> isolates from <jats:italic>Meretrix meretrix</jats:italic> were classified into 19 species and the dominant strains included <jats:italic>V. mediterranei</jats:italic> (19%) and <jats:italic>V. harveyi</jats:italic> (11%), <jats:italic>V. algolyticus</jats:italic> (10%), and <jats:italic>V. parahaemolyticus</jats:italic> (8%). The species and abundance of <jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic> spp. were the highest in the 3-year-old of <jats:italic>Meretrix meretrix</jats:italic> compared with clams of other ages in the summer. Among the 73 isolates, 68 <jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic> strains were resistant to other 15 antibiotics except for sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim with 57 resistant phenotypes. The most prevalent resistance was toward clindamycin (76%), followed by amikacin (63%), ampicillin (62%), rifampicin (62%), vancomycin (57%), and amoxicillin (50%). The ARI values of <jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic> spp. in different ages ranged from 0.13 to 0.18, and ARI values of 3-year-old (ARI=0.18) clams are higher than that of other ages clam. Approximately 72% of the resistant isolates showed multidrug-resistant phenotypes with maximum resistance to 15 antibiotics. Tolerance to heavy metals including Cd, Zn, and Cu was detected in the majority of antibiotic resistant isolates. In addition to the co-resistance to the same class of antibiotics, resistance to cephalosporin (CFP, CEP, CZ) were significantly correlated with penicillins (AMP, AMC) (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.01), tetracycline (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.001), sulfanilamide (SXT) (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.01) and quinolone (CIP) (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&amp;lt; 0.01).

AB  - <jats:p>Wild gadoids are known to have close associations with open-net fish farms, leading to concerns about changes in natural fish distribution and feeding patterns. However, the nature of the relationships between non-pelagic fish and mobile benthic invertebrates and aquaculture facilities remains poorly documented, even though this group contains widespread commercial North Atlantic species. This study utilizes baited remote and towed underwater video surveys to resolve the ecosystem-level effects of open salmon aquaculture cages and organic enrichment on the spatial structure and relative abundance of demersal fish and crustacean communities. Towed camera surveys were carried out 50 to &amp;gt;600 m downstream of three farms producing finfish in Western Finnmark and four in the Frøya region of Norway. Towed camera surveys were paired with baited remote underwater video surveys at the four Frøya farms. The declining enrichment gradient with distance downstream of the farm cages was confirmed by modeled and observed depositional flux measurements and benthic infaunal community composition. The community structure of wild demersal fish and crustaceans in close association with the seafloor varied with the distance from the aquaculture sites. In addition to the established pattern of the attraction of gadoids, the edible crab (<jats:italic>Cancer pagurus</jats:italic>) and flatfish (<jats:italic>Pleuronectes platessa</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Microstomus kitt</jats:italic>) showed a preference for areas 10–150 m from farm cages where organically enriched sediments contain a rich food source of opportunistic polychaetes. In contrast, the cuckoo wrasse (<jats:italic>Labrus mixtus</jats:italic>) and the common hermit crab (<jats:italic>Pagurus bernhardus</jats:italic>) exhibited higher numbers in locations over 600 m from the farms. Findings show how changes in the benthic food web from aquaculture enrichment can affect the spatial distribution of poorly studied but commercially important fish and crustaceans. Such changes in distribution can impact the availability of these species to coastal fisheries, especially in dense aquaculture regions.</jats:p>

AB  - Commercial net-pen mariculture of Seriola dumerili recently started in Mediterranean countries. While the introduction of new species allows for product diversification and strengthens the European seafood market, net-pen farming and escape events can lead to a number of socio-economic and ecological interactions in the coastal zone. To assist in the genetic management of broodstocks and mitigate the effects of escape events, the potential of morphological and genetic traits of wild, farmed and escaped S. dumerili from the Balearic and the Adriatic Sea were examined as a proxy of wild and farmed origin. Body shape, head profile and mouth position allowed correct classification between fish groups (82%). The global FST of 0.053 across all loci showed significant subdivision between wild and farmed fish, and allowed correct assignment of escapees. Integration of both genetic and morphometric data using the R package assignPOP improved the assignment results of the escaped group with unknown origin. Potential ecological and socioeconomic implications of escape events are discussed, along with guidelines promoting sustainable development of coastal net-pen aquaculture in a future to come.

AB  - <jats:p> The impacts fishing communities face as a result of declining fisheries productivity and access may largely hinge on measurable attributes of their social resilience. Wild-origin Pacific salmon populations have been in a marked decline since the 1960s, resulting in progressively declining access for many commercial fisheries. More recent acute stressors have caused appreciable tribulation to commercial fishers in British Columbia, raising concern over their capacity to remain viable in the industry, and underscoring the need to examine the fishery under a social resilience framework. Here, we coupled an online survey instrument with in-depth interviews to assess commercial salmon fishers’ social resilience, socioeconomic characteristics, risk perceptions, trust in fishery management, and the relationships between these variables. Our results show that social resilience is low overall, with older, more experienced, and less diversified fishers being particularly vulnerable to declining salmon access. While 73% of fishers reported having plans to adapt to future declines in salmon access, 92% reported feeling that there are barriers impeding their adaptation, and 75% reported having no trust in fisheries management helping them adapt. Fishers’ social resilience was positively correlated with their trust in, and perceived trust from fisheries management. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>This study demonstrates how a comprehensive knowledge base can be used by the aquaculture industry, researchers, and policymakers as a foundation for more targeted and detailed climate change impact analysis, risk assessments and adaptation planning. Atlantic salmon (<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>) production in Norway was used as a case study and to illustrate the need to consider impacts from multiple stressors across different production stages and the wider supply chain. Based on literature searches and industry news, a total of 45 impacts and 101 adaptation responses were identified. Almost all impacts were linked to multiple climate stressors, and many adaptation responses can be used for a range of impacts. Based on the research, a move towards more targeted and detailed assessments is recommended. This can be facilitated through a strong knowledge base, further research to address complexities, and better communication between all stakeholders. The results also demonstrate the need for more climate change research that reflects the challenges that the aquaculture sector faces, where multiple stressors and the range of impacts across production stages and the wider supply chain are included. Highlighting the wide range of stressors, impacts and adaptation responses provides a more holistic understanding of the real-world complexities that aquaculture producers face. This again could facilitate adoption of more effective responses to climate change needed to maintain or increase production sustainably.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Atlantic salmon<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>is a socio-economically important anadromous fish species that has suffered synchronous population declines around the North Atlantic over the last five decades. Reduced marine survival has been implicated as a key driver of the declines, yet the relative importance of different stressors causing mortality at sea is not well understood. This review presents a synopsis of the principal stressors impacting Atlantic salmon in estuarine and marine environments. It also applies a semi-quantitative 2-D classification system to assess the relative effects of these stressors on English salmon stocks and their likely development over the next decade. Climate change and predation were identified as the biggest threats at present and over the next decade. Poor water quality and bycatch were classified as relatively high impact stressors, but with a lower likelihood of becoming more prevalent in the future due to available mitigation measures. Other, less influential, stressors included tidal barrages, artificial light at night, impingement in power-station cooling waters and thermal discharges, pile-driving noise pollution, invasive non-native species, electromagnetic fields, salmon mariculture, and tidal lagoons. Salmon fisheries exploitation was not regarded as an important stressor currently because effective exploitation rate controls have been implemented to substantially reduce fishing pressure. Future research priorities include addressing knowledge gaps on expanding stressor impacts from climate change, predation, renewable energy developments, and artificial light at night. Local management actions directed towards improving freshwater and estuarine habitats to maximise ecosystem resilience to stressors and minimise their cumulative impacts are recommended.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>This study compares the farm management model used in the Mediterranean gilthead seabream (GHSB; Sparus aurata) industry (S1)—stepped entry of juveniles throughout the year with several production cycles and fish ages overlapping in a single farm—with that used in the salmon industry (S2)—the whole is farm filled with fish that are the same age at once with a fallowing period between rearing cycles—in terms of waste production by coupling digestibility coefficients with growth, feeding, and eating behavior models into a mass balance model. We considered the total C, N, and P content in the different waste fractions (particulate and dissolved wastes). The model, which simulated real farming conditions, showed relevant quantitative and qualitative differences between both strategies, with stocked biomass and water temperature as the main drivers, the amount of feed wasted by chewing as the most relevant fraction differentiating both strategies, and the fallowing period as the main distinguishing management feature. We discuss the influence of both farming strategies on some key performance and environmental aspects, such as benthic recovery, the breakdown of the life cycle of pathogens, and adaptability to climate change. Our results suggest that changing the GHSB industry’s production model is necessary for its sustainability.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p> Juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in British Columbia migrate past numerous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms from which they may acquire infectious agents. We analyse patterns of molecular detection in juvenile sockeye for the bacterium Tenacibaculum maritimum, known to cause disease in fish globally and to cause mouthrot disease in farmed Atlantic salmon in British Columbia. Our data show a clear peak in T. maritimum detections in the Discovery Islands region of British Columbia, where sockeye migrate close to salmon farms. Using well-established differential equation models to describe sockeye migration and bacterial infection, fit to detection data, we assessed support for multiple hypotheses describing farm- and background-origin infection. Our best models (with 99.8% empirical support) describe constant background infection pressure, except around Discovery Islands salmon farms, where farm-origin infection pressure peaked at 12.7 (approximate 95% CI: 4.5 to 31) times background levels. Given the severity of associated disease in related species and the imperilled nature of Fraser River sockeye, our results suggest the need for a more precautionary approach to managing farm–wild interactions in sockeye salmon. </jats:p>

AB  - Development of benthic components within integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems warrants more attention, and the development of polychaetes as an extractive component in IMTA systems is ongoing. This study estimates the bioremediation potential of Capitella sp. and Ophryotrocha craigsmithi for coupled and decoupled salmon-driven IMTA. In coupled IMTA, polychaetes receive fresh faeces, while in decoupled IMTA, preservation of faeces is applied. Respiration and ammonia excretion rates were measured for polychaetes fed fresh, oven-dried or acidified salmon faeces, and combined with nutrients incorporated into tissue growth, to estimate nutrient requirements. Nutrient requirements were subsequently used to evaluate bioremediation potential. Metabolic rates were highest for O. craigsmithi and contributed notably to their overall nutrient requirement (20-30%). For the 2 polychaete species, nutrient requirements ranged from 5 to 26 mg C and from 2 to 6 mg N g-1 AFDW d-1. These requirements were comparable with or higher than other polychaete species, highlighting the potential for fish waste bioremediation by Capitella sp. and O. craigsmithi. Preserved diets reduced bioremediation potential 1.5 and 3-5 times for, respectively, Capitella sp. and O. craigsmithi. Assuming that polychaetes are efficient fish-faeces convertors, the bioremediation potential indicates that benthic cultivation units containing 65000-95000 ind. m-2 of Capitella sp. or 36000-194000 ind. m-2 of O. craigsmithi can convert the daily organic waste flux deposited below an average salmon farm. These densities were within ranges reported for wild populations, indicating that, based on the bioremediation potential, development of benthic IMTA with these 2 polychaete species seems realistic and efficient for waste conversion.

AB  - Fish aquaculture is a rapidly expanding global industry, set to support growing demands for sources of marine protein. Enhancing feed efficiency (FE) in farmed fish is required to reduce production costs and improve sector sustainability. Recognising that organisms are complex systems whose emerging phenotypes are the product of multiple interacting molecular processes, systems-based approaches are expected to deliver new biological insights into FE and growth performance. Here, we establish 14 diverse layers of multi-omics and clinical covariates to assess their capacities to predict FE and associated performance traits in a fish model (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) and uncover the influential variables. Inter-omic relatedness between the different layers revealed several significant concordances, particularly between datasets originating from similar material/tissue and between blood indicators and some of the proteomic (liver), metabolomic (liver), and microbiomic layers. Single- and multi-layer random forest (RF) regression models showed that integration of all data layers provide greater FE prediction power than any single-layer model alone. Although FE was among the most challenging of the traits we attempted to predict, the mean accuracy of 40 different FE models in terms of root-mean square errors normalized to percentage was 30.4%, supporting RF as a feature selection tool and approach for complex trait prediction. Major contributions to the integrated FE models were derived from layers of proteomic and metabolomic data, with substantial influence also provided by the lipid composition layer. A correlation matrix of the top 27 variables in the models highlighted FE trait-associations with faecal bacteria (<i>Serratia</i> spp.), palmitic and nervonic acid moieties in whole body lipids, levels of free glycerol in muscle, and N-acetylglutamic acid content in liver. In summary, we identified subsets of molecular characteristics for the assessment of commercially relevant performance-based metrics in farmed Chinook salmon.

AB  - Aquaculture eco-certification is associated with some producer-level benefits including price premiums and market access; however, reputational benefits from eco-certification are unclear. A public survey was used to understand the effect of eco-certification on opinion of salmon farming in two Canadian provinces (British Columbia and Nova Scotia) and differences between communities where farms are located (communities of place) and communities geographically distant from farms (communities of interest). Eco-certification had an overall positive effect on opinion, especially amongst people with a negative opinion of salmon farming who value far-reaching social outcomes of farming. Communities of interest had a more negative opinion of salmon farming and eco-certified salmon farming and were more concerned about local environmental impacts than communities of place while communities of place valued economic outcomes more than communities of interest. The role of eco-certification in public acceptance of aquaculture is limited by a lack of trust in eco-certification and failure to address local issues including conflict amongst marine users.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) related mass mortality events in land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are associated with the sudden release of substantial amounts of H2S, resulting in acutely toxic exposure. However, the production and release of H2S can also occur at slower constant rates, leading to continuous exposure to sublethal H2S concentrations, the effects of which are unknown. Here, we examined growth rates, feed conversion ratios, and apparent nutrient digestibility in post-smolt Atlantic salmon, following a 10-day exposure to one of two sublethal concentrations of H2S, compared against a control group. The H2S concentrations of the low exposure (LE) and moderate exposure (ME) groups throughout the trial were 1.8 ± 0.8 μg/L and 4.1 ± 1.9 μg/L, respectively. Neither exposure regime affected growth, feed utilization, or the apparent nutrient digestibility. The results suggest that Atlantic salmon tolerate exposure to sublethal H2S concentrations for 10 days, without a discernible effect on the production performance. For aquaculture systems, specifically RAS, this means that while higher concentrations of H2S should be strictly avoided, the presence of low H2S concentrations for a limited period might not be detrimental to fish welfare or production. The RAS environment is complex, and the potential combined effects of H2S and factors pertinent to RAS may influence fish performance differently in a production setting.

AB  - Abstract Intensive fish farming is a major industry, but the extent of organic matter (OM) and heavy metal pollution by fish farms is debated. This study established in situ reference conditions using geochemical parameters and fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages in dated sediment cores to identify potential impacts of fish farming in two basins of the inner Oksfjord, Northern Norway. Living (rose Bengal stained) benthic foraminifera were used to assess the present day environmental conditions. The fossil foraminiferal records were compared with the living foraminifera, which in turn were compared with macrofaunal data. Long-term (>100 yrs) sediment core records of the geochemical parameters (TOC63, C/N, δ13CVPDB TOC and heavy metals) and foraminiferal indices (Norwegian Quality Index (fNQI), AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index (fAMBI), fHlog2, ES100) did not indicate an impact from fish farming through time. Long-term changes in foraminiferal absolute abundances and relative abundances of ecological groups (EGs) reflecting organic matter (OM) tolerance suggest that the OM supply slightly increased compared to reference conditions. Relative abundances of Brizalina skagerrakensis and Epistominella vitrea, previously associated with phytodetrital input, suggest a minor increase in primary productivity compared to reference conditions. The Stainforthia group (S. fusiformis and S. feylingi), indicative of OM enrichment, in the living foraminiferal assemblages may indicate a response to fish farming activities, but foraminiferal seasonality could not be excluded as a potential cause. The indices of both fossil and living foraminifera, in addition to the macrofauna showed a good to high Ecological Quality Status (EcoQS) through time and at present. This indicates that environmental conditions have been and still are acceptable.

AB  - A review of biomass use by humans and the greenhouse gas (GHG) implications of using biomass to supply energy services is presented. Human appropriation of global terrestrial net primary productivity is a ratio of appropriation and production; it currently stands at 15-30% of NPP. Over half of used biomass is fed to animals, while equal amounts are eaten directly by humans and burned for energy services. Published estimates of the potential for biomass to supply global energy services vary widely, but a range of 200-500 EJ/ yr has been proposed that considers limitations due to water scarcity, food demand and biodiversity protection. With respect to climate change, uncertainty regarding soil carbon storage capacity, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and emissions from land use change (LUC) influence the attractiveness of biomass energy (bioE) for GHG abatement. While humans have altered terrestrial biomass patterns for millennia, recent rates of carbon emissions from LUC have been relatively large. In the US, expanded biomass production for bioE could exacerbate the already unsustainable use of water for irrigation, although substantial opportunities exist for increased irrigation efficiency. I calculate that plausible life cycle GHG balances for annual and perennial bioE feedstocks in the Unites States (US) are 14 and 7 g CO2eq/ MJ, respectively, not including any land use or C stock changes. The influence of biofuel policies on land use change and the degree to which C storage in terrestrial ecosystems can reduce cost of climate change abatement is reviewed. I conclude Chapter 1 with an estimate that appropriating all US biomass exports and all roughage fed to beef cattle would supply about 8 EJ of bioE feedstock. 1.1 Primary production of biomass Autotrophs such as trees and grasses are living organisms which use light (electromagnetic radiation) as an energy source in order to build complex organic materials (e.g. carbohydrates). The organic compounds produced by autotrophs are referred to as “primary production”. Gross primary production is a measure of the amount of organic matter produced, and includes the 1 Some organisms harness energy stored in the chemical bonds of inorganic compounds (e.g. H2S and NH3) to function and build new biomass, and use CO2 as the carbon source. These chemoautotrophes are often found around under-ocean thermal vents and other extreme environments. They are primary producers as long as their inorganic energy sources are produced within the Earth’s interior (not biogenic).

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Aquaculture is a major user of plant-derived feed ingredients, such as vegetable oil. Production of vegetable oil and protein is generally more energy-intensive than production of the marine ingredients they replace, so increasing inclusion of vegetable ingredients increases the energy demand of the feed. Microbial oils, such as yeast oil made by fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysate, have been proposed as a complement to plant oils, but energy assessments of microbial oil production are needed. This study presents a mass and energy balance for a biorefinery producing yeast oil through conversion of wheat straw hydrolysate, with co-production of biomethane and power.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The results showed that 1 tonne of yeast oil (37 GJ) would require 9.2 tonnes of straw, 14.7 GJ in fossil primary energy demand, 14.6 GJ of process electricity and 13.3 GJ of process heat, while 21.5 GJ of biomethane (430 kg) and 6 GJ of excess power would be generated simultaneously. By applying economic allocation, the fossil primary energy demand was estimated to 11.9 GJ per tonne oil.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Fossil primary energy demand for yeast oil in the four scenarios studied was estimated to be 10-38% lower than for the commonly used rapeseed oil and process energy demand could be met by parallel combustion of lignin residues. Therefore, feed oil can be produced from existing non-food biomass without causing agricultural expansion.</AbstractText>

AB  - We review stakeholder perceptions in Chile regarding socioeconomic impacts of salmon aquaculture in the Chilean Patagonia. This is one of the fastest growing industries in Chile that developed with very limited regulation, which has resulted in significant effects on the ecosystem and local communities. After the Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) virus struck the industry in 2007, aquaculture companies helped to craft new legislation in an effort to create a sustainable industry. Nevertheless, some of the impacts remain and a new and small outbreak of the ISA virus struck in 2013. During this period, we conducted a series of workshops to evaluate stakeholder concerns regarding the impacts generated by aquaculture. Stakeholders from the government, NGOs, local communities, fishermen and aquaculture companies participated in a series of workshops, where they shared their different views about the impacts of the salmon industry in Chile. The analysis of this information provides an overview of the main issues from salmon aquaculture, a guide for regulators and firms about where negative perceptions exist, and recommendations on how the salmon industry can become more sustainable. We found that regulatory institutions and governance are the most important concerns of stakeholders to achieve a sustainable aquaculture industry in Chile. © 2015 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The production of Scottish Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) involves a global supply chain with greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted at every step. With the UK government setting a net zero target by 2050, and the Scottish Government having committed to achieving net zero by 2045, the Scottish salmon aquaculture sector now needs to start to develop and implement comprehensive emissions reductions measures. The methods demonstrated here and the identified imbalances in carbon emissions mitigation strategies provide a route to support this process. We use two international aquaculture operators in Scotland, Grieg Seafood and Mowi, as case studies to understand the scale of GHG emissions in the industry, how these compare to mitigation strategies, and where reduction efforts should be focused. Environmental data disclosed to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which includes in-depth breakdowns of GHG emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 categories were used for the first time in this comparison. This was contrasted with interview data from academics, industry experts and NGOs to identify routes to the most effective mitigation and reduction strategy. CDP data successfully identify imbalances between GHG emissions and mitigation strategies, and demonstrate that while Scope 1 emissions in Scottish aquaculture operations are high compared to other countries, Scope 3 emissions represent the majority of emissions. In terms of mitigation, Scope 1 and Scope 2 strategies are adequate, but Scope 3 mitigation strategies do not match the scale of emissions, identifying a potential route for future carbon emission reductions.

AB  - This review discusses and analyses previous results in identification, development and implementation of cleaner production strategies within the seafood industry. The relevant peer reviewed articles were identified from a structured keyword search and analysed by both supply chain stage (capture and aquaculture, transport, processing, storage and retail), and examination of the cleaner production strategies implemented. Results found entities along the seafood supply chain generally worked separately to improve cleaner production processes and outputs to grow their own businesses. Whilst this approach can be beneficial, it ignores the broader cleaner production potential benefits gained when applied across multiple supply chain entities. The most effective cleaner production strategies for improved environmental performance in each sector of the supply chain were identified with the potential to reduce unnecessary handling, energy usage, storage costs and waste production. To ensure the greatest reduction in environmental impact, a whole of supply chain management system that incorporates life cycle assessment modelling is recommended.

AB  - The water-sediment partitioning of flumequine and florfenicol, two antibiotics used in salmon aquaculture is a critical driver of their fate and environmental impact. Batch experiments, were carried out using pure water or seawater, with or without sediment, and at summer and winter temperatures of Chilean fjords. Log K<sub>d</sub> (partition between water and sediment) of florfenicol in seawater varied from 0.62 ± 0.69 to 0.67 ± 0.13, and Log K<sub>OC</sub> (partition between water and organic fraction of sediment) from 2.15± 0.29 to 2.19 ± 0.13. Difference between K<sub>OC</sub> and the octanol-water partition constant (K<sub>OW</sub>) showed that for florfenicol, adsorption onto the surface of particles was more significant than the absorption driven by hydrophobicity whilst hydrophobic absorption was a major driver of flumequine sorption. Flumequine Log K<sub>d</sub> (0.92 ± 0.25 to 1.36 ± 0.10) and Log K<sub>OC</sub> (from 2.44 ± 0.25 to 2.89 ± 0.10) demonstrated its greater affinity than florfenicol to particles and potential accumulation into marine sediments.

AB  - We conducted surveys of six hatcheries and 18 farms for data inputs to complete a cradle-to-farm-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental performance for intensive (for export markets in Chicago) and semi-intensive (for domestic markets in Shanghai) shrimp farming systems in Hainan Province, China. The relative contribution to overall environmental performance of processing and distribution to final markets were also evaluated from a cradle-to-destination-port perspective. Environmental impact categories included global warming, acidification, eutrophication, cumulative energy use, and biotic resource use. Our results indicated that intensive farming had significantly higher environmental impacts per unit production than semi-intensive farming in all impact categories. The grow-out stage contributed between 96.4% and 99.6% of the cradle-to-farm-gate impacts. These impacts were mainly caused by feed production, electricity use, and farm-level effluents. By averaging over intensive (15%) and semi-intensive (85%) farming systems, 1 metric ton (t) live-weight of shrimp production in China required 38.3 ± 4.3 GJ of energy, as well as 40.4 ± 1.7 t of net primary productivity, and generated 23.1 ± 2.6 kg of SO(2) equiv, 36.9 ± 4.3 kg of PO(4) equiv, and 3.1 ± 0.4 t of CO(2) equiv. Processing made a higher contribution to cradle-to-destination-port impacts than distribution of processed shrimp from farm gate to final markets in both supply chains. In 2008, the estimated total electricity consumption, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions from Chinese white-leg shrimp production would be 1.1 billion kW·h, 49 million GJ, and 4 million metric tons, respectively. Improvements suggested for Chinese shrimp aquaculture include changes in feed composition, farm management, electricity-generating sources, and effluent treatment before discharge. Our results can be used to optimize market-oriented shrimp supply chains and promote more sustainable shrimp production and consumption.

AB  - AbstractThe population of anadromous steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Keogh River has been studied intensively, in part because of its pattern of declining recruitment, which is largely attributed to poor marine survival. Climate variability has changed the productivity of salmonid species in all regions of the North Pacific, with areas alternately shifting between periods of enhanced and depressed productivity. The mechanisms governing marine survival and adult recruitment are central to contemporary resource management concerns but are also of concern with regard to the long-term prospects of managing biodiversity. We provide evidence that postsmolt growth contributes to the pattern of marine survival of Keogh River steelhead over the period corresponding to smolt years 1977–1999. Size at ocean entry did not appear to have sufficient contrast to significantly affect survival. However, assessment of scale growth suggested that the fish's initial growth at sea is not as important as the sustained grow...

AB  - <jats:p>The giant freshwater prawn (GFP), Macrobrachium rosenbergii has emerged as a significant crustacean in global aquaculture. A cradle-to-farm Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to assess the potential environmental impacts of GFP in Malaysia. The four main iterative farming phases involved were pond preparation, stocking, farming, and harvesting. The impact categories chosen were global warming, terrestrial ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, human non-carcinogenic toxicity, human carcinogenic activity, and water consumption. The software SimaPro 9.3.0.3 was used for impact analysis, with background data from the database Ecoinvent 3.0. and ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) V1.06/World (2010). Among other environmental impact categories, stocking and harvesting phases contributed to human carcinogenic toxicity impact values of 33.33%, followed by farming (33.31%). Another impact category, freshwater ecotoxicity also produces the same pattern with the stocking and harvesting process, still generating the highest impact value of 33.34%, followed by farming (33.30%). Apart from the identified capital items that require consideration for future waste management in aquaculture, this LCA study found that M. rosenbergii farming generates a low impact to the environment, however, could inspire further research on other perspectives of sustainability.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Taking “blue granary” as the research object, this study focuses on the mechanism and evolution of coupling coordination relationship between green transformation and the quality of economic development, to explore the path of sustainable development. Firstly, the theoretical framework of coupling relationship between green transformation and the quality of development is constructed. Secondly, an evaluation index system is established to measure green transformation and the quality of economic development. Thirdly, the entropy approach and coupled coordination degree model are used to calculate the coordination of green transformation and the quality of economic development in different provinces in China from 2009 to 2018. The results show that: (1) Green transformation affects the quality of economic development through resource effect, social effect, and technological effect; the quality of economic development affects green transformation through new growth momentum effect, income distribution effect, scale effect, and opening up effect. (2) Both the quality of economic development and the level of green transformation continue to improve, but the growth rate of green transformation is relatively slow. (3) The overall coupled coordination relationship improves from a barely balanced stage to a favorably balanced stage, but it has not reached the ideal state of superiorly balanced, and there is significant regional heterogeneity. It will help to clarify the difference in coordinated development levels in different regions and provide a reference value for the precise implementation of eco-economic coordinated development.</jats:p>

AB  - Compared to a century ago, the world's fishing fleets are larger and more powerful, are travelling further and are producing higher quality products. These developments come largely at a cost of high-fossil fuel energy inputs. Rising energy prices, climate change and consumer demand for ‘green’ products have placed energy use and emissions among the sustainability criteria of food production systems. We have compiled all available published and unpublished fuel use data for fisheries targeting all species, employing all gears and fishing in all regions of the world into a Fisheries and Energy Use Database (FEUD). Here, we present results of our analysis of the relative energy performance of fisheries since 1990 and provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on fuel inputs to diverse fishing fleets. The median fuel use intensity of global fishery records since 1990 is 639 litres per tonne. Fuel inputs to fisheries vary by several orders of magnitude, with small pelagic fisheries ranking among the world's most efficient forms of animal protein production and crustaceans ranking among the least efficient. Trends in Europe and Australia since the beginning of the 21st century suggest fuel use efficiency is improving, although this has been countered by a more rapid increase in oil prices. Management decisions, technological improvements and behavioural changes can further reduce fuel consumption in the short term, although the most effective improvement to fisheries energy performance will come as a result of rebuilding stocks where they are depressed and reducing over-capacity.

AB  - This study represents the first example of genetic assignment being used to identify the farm of origin for escaped Atlantic salmon. Following reports by local fishers of escaped farmed salmon in Romsdalfjord, western Norway, baseline samples were collected from 16 cages located on seven operational farms. The baseline samples, in addition to 29 escapees, were screened for 15 microsatellite loci. Pairwise FST values between baseline samples varied from ,0.001 to 0.154, indicating variable but significant genetic differences among them. Direct assignment of the escapees (data from 13 informative loci) demonstrated that the most likely origin of 21 of them was from a single baseline sample (5I) collected at one farm. At a probability of 0.01, between 25 and 29 of the escapees were rejected in 12 baseline samples, 19– 21 escapees were rejected from another three baseline samples, and only seven of the escapees were rejected from baseline sample 5I. Consequently, these data demonstrate that most of the escapees most likely originated from a single farm, and importantly, that 15 of the 16 baseline samples could with high probability be excluded as donors for most of the escapees recaptured in the area.

AB  - In this article, I estimate the cobweb model for Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon market that allows me to verify the cyclicality of the market, and the simulations that based on the estimation indicates the evaluation of the model’s explanatory ability for the cyclicality. By using annual panel data from 1994 to 2011, I found that the cobweb structure explains some part of the cyclicality. This result makes a contribution to understand about the market and make a policy for reducing the cyclicality that deteriorate the profitability of supplier in long-term.

AB  - <jats:p>This paper reviews the impacts of shellfish and finfish aquaculture on eelgrass <jats:italic>Zostera marina</jats:italic>, the most widely distributed seagrass species in the northern hemisphere. Shellfish aquaculture can have positive, neutral, and negative effects on eelgrass. Positive interactions can be generated by the filtering activity of cultured bivalves, which may improve water quality and reduce epiphyte loads, and shellfish biodeposits may provide more nutrients to eelgrass and other vegetation. However, negative responses are more commonly reported and can be caused by shading and sedimentation. These negative effects tend to occur directly under and immediately surrounding shellfish farms and rapidly diminish with increasing distance. In contrast to shellfish aquaculture, only one field study has investigated the effects of finfish aquaculture on eelgrass in a temperate setting, and the results were inconclusive. However, many studies have investigated the effects of Mediterranean finfish farms on 2 other species of seagrass (<jats:italic>Posidonia oceanica</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Cymodocea nodosa</jats:italic>). These studies reported clear negative interactions, which have been linked to increased nutrient concentrations, sulphides, sedimentation, epiphyte loads, and grazing pressure. It is unknown if these studies are relevant for finfish aquaculture in temperate regions due to differences in environmental conditions, and because the studies focused on different species of seagrass. Thus, further study in a temperate setting is warranted. We conclude by highlighting key research gaps that could help regulators establish unambiguous operational and siting guidelines that minimize the potential for negative interactions between aquaculture and eelgrass.</jats:p>

AB  - Rapid advances in the aquaculture industry pose an environmental challenge that is generated by outbreeding between escaped domesticated and wild individuals. Given that escapees genetically differ from wild individuals because of domestication and possibly by ancestry, periodic domesticated-wild outbreeding has the potential to influence fitness-related traits in wild populations. In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), the understanding of mechanisms and direction of domesticated influences are especially important because of the conservation concerns associated with many wild populations, notably in the southern parts of their North Atlantic range. My thesis investigates domestication-induced, genetically based changes during the parr stage by assessing growth, parr maturity and survival under predation for three salmon strains differing in their history of domestication, as examined in two semi-natural environments (predator present, absent). Growth and size-at-age increased with increasing generations of domestication, yet male parr maturation probability declined. Survival under gape-limited predation increased with domestication-conveyed increases in size and growth rate. Domesticated but not wild individuals exhibited stress-resistant growth in the presence of a predator. To assess mechanism and magnitudes of trait changes resulting from domesticated-wild outbreeding, a domesticated strain was crossed with a wild population (up to third-generation hybrids) and outbreeding effects were studied for different life stages, several controlled environmental laboratory conditions, and traits. Life stages included the developmental periods between egg and fry, and between immature and adult post smolts. Traits assessed included survival, yolk conversion efficiency, size-at-age, maturation probability, growth rate, mRNA transcript levels and their environmental plasticity. For many traits, both additive and non-additive genetic components in the between-population genetic architecture were revealed by cross means analyses. Furthermore, maternal outbreeding effects on early life stages were present. Altogether the results indicate that constant outbreeding effects of escapees on wild populations will increase present growth rates during all life stages and decrease early maturation probabilities for male parr and post-smolts, but by unpredictable magnitudes across hybrid generations. Maternally controlled co-adapted traits might be disrupted in hybrid mothers. Further, mixed-origin individuals might be temporarily at an advantage relative to wild individuals because of size and growth advantages and these might accelerate a wild genotypes displacement.

AB  - Conservation, like beauty, is clearly in the eye of the beholder. The lack of a clear definition of what is meant by the term conservation, however, may encourage misconceptions about the degree to which biological objectives can be traded off against pressing economic and social objectives. Our purpose is to promote a dialogue about the meaning and practice of conservation, which might lead toward consensus on essential biological objectives. We present a brief history of the philosophical evolution of the term conservation and offer a definition of conservation based on the argument for an ecological ethic. This ethic requires that human benefits be derived in a sustainable manner and recognizes that human uses need to be reconciled with intrinsic and necessary ecosystemic functions and structures. We then present a preliminary set of operating principles applicable to the management of fish stocks that are consistent with an ecological or ecosystemic view of conservation. By proposing a set of conserva...

AB  - Despite increased interest in Chinook salmon aquaculture, there is inadequate understanding regarding the bacterial immune defenses of this species. This study describes the establishment and characterization of a continuous stromal-like cell line derived from Chinook salmon spleen, CHST, and its response to a heat-killed bacterial exposure challenge. Optimal growth of CHST was seen at 18 °C when grown in Leibovitz's L15 media supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum. DNA analyses confirmed that CHST did originate from Chinook salmon tissue. Vibrio anguillarum, a common pathogen of marine aquaculture and the causative agent of an acute hemorrhagic septicaemia known as vibriosis was used for exposure studies. V. anguillarum was heat-killed and CHST was challenged so that pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα) as well as anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine transcript levels could be measured at 1, 4, 12, 24 and 96 hour (h) post-exposure. The heat-killed bacteria were observed to significantly stimulate the expression of all three pro-inflammatory cytokines at 4, 12, 24 and 96 h post-exposure with the peak in expression occurring at 12 and 24 h. Meanwhile, IL-10 was not observed to significantly increase until 96 h post-stimulation, which was also the time when the inflammatory cytokine expression was decreasing. The establishment and characterization of CHST provides a valuable model for studying the immune response of Chinook salmon stromal-like cells in response to stimuli, including those of bacterial origin.

AB  - The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-EB) encompass several important human pathogens and are found on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. They are a group of organisms which demonstrate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and their presence has been documented worldwide, including in aquaculture and the aquatic environment. This risk profile was developed following the Codex Guidelines for Risk Analysis of Foodborne Antimicrobial Resistance with the objectives of describing the current state of knowledge of ESBL-EB in relation to retail shrimp and salmon available to consumers in Canada, the primary aquacultured species consumed in Canada. The risk profile found that Enterobacterales and ESBL-EB have been found in multiple aquatic environments, as well as multiple host species and production levels. Although the information available did not permit the conclusion as to whether there is a human health risk related to ESBLs in Enterobacterales in salmon and shrimp available for consumption by Canadians, ESBL-EB in imported seafood available at the retail level in Canada have been found. Surveillance activities to detect ESBL-EB in seafood are needed; salmon and shrimp could be used in initial surveillance activities, representing domestic and imported products.

AB  - The utilization of feed resources in Norwegian farming of Atlantic salmon has been reported for 2010, 2012, 2016 and 2020. The present paper is a corresponding documentation for farming of rainbow trout in Norway in 2020. 89,667 tonnes of rainbow trout were produced, which is 6 % of the amount of salmon produced. The 116,990 tonnes of ingredients used for feed sold as trout feed were produced from 13.4 % marine protein sources, 10.8 marine oils, 39.7 % vegetable protein sources, 19.9 % vegetable oils, 12.1 % carbohydrate sources and 3.9 % micro ingredients, which include vitamin and mineral premixes, crystalline amino acids and astaxanthin. In addition, was 0.2 %, or 257 tonnes, of single cell protein, insect meal, fermented products and microalgae used in trout feed. Norwegian fish meal and fish oil constituted 8.8 % of the ingredients, and the remaining 91.2 % were imported ingredients. The economic feed conversion factor (FCR) was 1.30, 1.21 or 1.44 if calculated from feed ingredients ‘as is’, feed ingredients on dry matter basis, or from registered traded feed, respectively. The trout retained 37 %, 43 %, 33 %, 63 % and 63 % of the feed’s dry matter, energy, protein, fat and EPA+DHA, respectively, in the whole body. In fillet, the corresponding retention values were 21 %, 25 %, 23 %, 34 % and 35 %, respectively. The feed utilization in trout was slightly overestimated because of some salmon feed used in the trout production. The feed ingredients used and the feed utilization in trout farming in 2020 were similar to the data for salmon farming, but trout is produced in a smaller quantity.

AB  - Aquaculture is playing an important role in the development of fisheries in Vietnam, a role which has accelerated since 2000. Sustainability in aquaculture is receiving increasing attention, and this issue is not only the concern of government, but also stakeholders participating in the value chain. Therefore, this study aims to identify sustainability issues of farmed seafood by assessing the main sustainability issues raising concern. The Global Value Chain framework described by Gereffi et al. (2005) is applied for this study to explore the business relationships in supply chain and the perceptions of sustainability concerned by the value chain actors. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used to collect data. An assessment of four species cultured on the Mekong Delta, the countries farmed seafood ‘hub’, found a clear distinction between species cultured with a local domestic market orientation (Giant Freshwater Prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii; and Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus) and the two key export commodities Striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) and Penaeid shrimp (Penaeus monodon & Litopenaeus vannamei). These orientations were based on a range of factors including the development of effective seed supplies and the cultural value of marketing in the live format. This study, conducted in ten provinces in the Mekong Delta from 2009 to 2013 had a focus on understanding the export-orientated commodities, striped catfish and shrimp through collection of baseline information on the value chain of farmed seafood, focusing on the farming sector, the actors and institutions involved and beneficiaries. Sustainability issues and perceptions of experts (top-down) and primary stakeholders (bottom-up) opinions were assessed through participatory workshops.

AB  - <jats:p>The global expansion of aquaculture has driven significant technological advancements, including raceways, Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture (IMTA) and marine offshore cages. However, unregulated aquaculture escapees pose a severe threat to aquatic biodiversity, acting as a potential time bomb for the entire ecosystem. Addressing this issue requires a comprehensive understanding of the impact of unintentional escapees on aquatic ecosystems, particularly in India and riparian East African countries (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania). Using an exploratory research design drawing from various peer-reviewed sources, this study outlines the dynamic growth of aquaculture in these countries, identifies high-impact escape incidents, and correlates risks and remedies with global cases, especially in regions such as Norway, Scotland, Ireland, Colombia, and the United States, where serious incidents of aquaculture escapees have been reported. The research categorizes aquaculture development trends, discusses mechanisms of escapee impact, proposes remedies, assesses methods and inferential strength, and highlights gaps in the existing literature. The study revealed complex ecological shifts caused by aquaculture escapees from invasive non-native fish species, affecting predation, competition, and genetic diversity. Escaped fish from aquaculture facilities pose a significant threat to aquatic biodiversity, especially in the study regions. The escalating risk of unintentional escapes was highlighted in India and three East African countries. To mitigate this, the study proposes integrating escapee management into national fisheries systems, amending fisheries laws, holding fish farmers accountable for aquaculture system failure, and developing comprehensive regulations for non-native species in aquaculture within the study regions. It is recommended to standardize the planning for aquaculture facilities and implement emergency plans, training, local mobilization and further research on the impact thresholds of aquaculture escapees in the study regions. Ecological education in aquaculture communities and the recognition of the role of translational scientists are crucial for the dissemination of knowledge. Urgent government action is needed to address unreported aquaculture escapes, preventing further ecosystem degradation and ensuring global aquaculture sustainability.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract Norwegian salmon farming has grown tremendously over the last 50 years, and it now constitutes around 75% of the country's total seafood export value. The grow-out phase typically takes place in coastal waters. There are ambitions for continued strong growth. Five years ago, a survey revealed that the fish farmers saw the lack of available sea area as the industry's greatest challenge for continued growth. This paper examines the current and future situation for area use, needs and availability, for salmon farming in Norway. The paper considers several possible changes that can influence this, including the coastal zone planning system, new technologies for offshore, land-based and closed salmon farming, and new tax-schemes that affect the distribution of burdens and benefits from salmon farming. The main finding is that central government has several options available, if it would like to prioritise aquaculture in terms of access to coastal waters. However, this would imply a full-scale overhaul of the present allocation system, as well as a dramatic change of the current planning system, which in turn means challenging local democracy – not a very likely development under the current political circumstances. This leaves the industry with two options; to reduce salmon lice, emissions and escapes and to increase legitimacy on all levels, and by granting the local municipalities a larger share of the enormous value creation seen in the salmon sector. While the ambitious plans of doubling production by 2030 and increase it five times by 2050 certainly will require more and better coastal aquaculture localities, the actual extent of area shortage will to a large degree depend on the development of new production models; land-based, offshore, contained net pens and the production of large smolt. Success in these endeavours, could also have an impact on global production of salmon, by opening the market for new actors, thus reducing the Norwegian share and the profitability of the industry.

AB  - Although many fisheries stocks have declined precipitously throughout the world, fish farming--and especially shrimp and salmon farming--has boomed. The increasingly large scale of these enterprises is now having unforeseen ecological consequences on ocean resources through habitat destruction, effluent discharge, exotic species introductions, and heightened fish catch for feed use. Ending unsustainable production practices will require reorienting regulatory policies and fiscal incentives in shrimp- and salmon-producing counties, and enhancing restrictions on environmentally unsound practices.

AB  - Abstract This paper studies the optimal harvesting decisions of a salmon farmer that faces the risk of harmful algal bloom as well as market uncertainty. The salmon farmer seeks to maximize the financial value of the fish farm by determining the optimal course of actions during the algal bloom, and the optimal time to harvest after the bloom. Specifically, we compare the options to perform an early harvest and to wait in order to learn about the true algal risk. We extend this framework by taking into account the option to move the salmon to an algal free location. To illustrate the results and investigate the robustness of our model, we present two case studies with realistic industry parameters from Norway and Chile. We find that there is a significant value associated with the ability of salmon farmers to actively learn about the true risk of losing the biomass. This value is strongly affected by the availability of frequent and reliable information about the algal risk emphasizing the importance of communication between industry actors, as well as facilitation of effective information flow by policy makers and research organizations.

AB  - Domesticated species frequently spread their genes into populations of wild relatives through interbreeding. The domestication process often involves artificial selection for economically desirable traits. This can lead to an indirect response in unknown correlated traits and a reduction in fitness of domesticated individuals in the wild. Previous models for the effect of gene flow from domesticated species to wild relatives have assumed that evolution occurs in one dimension. Here, I develop a quantitative genetic model for the balance between migration and multivariate stabilizing selection. Different forms of correlational selection consistent with a given observed ratio between average fitness of domesticated and wild individuals offsets the phenotypic means at migration-selection balance away from predictions based on simpler one-dimensional models. For almost all parameter values, correlational selection leads to a reduction in the migration load. For ridge selection, this reduction arises because the distance the immigrants deviates from the local optimum in effect is reduced. For realistic parameter values, however, the effect of correlational selection on the load is small, suggesting that simpler one-dimensional models may still be adequate in terms of predicting mean population fitness and viability.

AB  - While highly successful in terms of profitable seafood production, salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture may also be a source of potential negative environmental externalities. In an attempt to address these challenges through supporting the development of new technology, the Norwegian government has introduced a new class of aquaculture licenses labeled as development licenses. As a result, new technological solutions were proposed to reduce negative externalities through (1) expansion to open ocean areas not yet used for aquaculture and (2) reduced emissions from inshore production systems. This paper presents an analysis of the technological concepts proposed in applications for development licenses. The applications for development licenses provide a unique perspective on what technological directions existing marine aquaculture companies envisage that marine aquaculture may take in the future. The analysis indicates that units will become larger and stronger, as well as being specially designed to suit a variety of environments, creating a more heterogeneous industry. Large offshore structures such as semi-submersible platforms and other strong, rigid structures with permeable enclosures (nets) have been particularly successful in this application process, receiving relatively many development licenses. In sheltered fjord areas, many concepts involving closed enclosures (bags and tanks) have been suggested and awarded licenses.

AB  - <jats:p>Aquaculture is an important component of the human diet, providing high-quality aquatic food for global or local consumption. Egypt is one of the countries most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change (CC), especially in the aquaculture sector. CC is one of the biggest challenges of our time and has negatively affected different water bodies. CC leads to the combination of changes in water availability, a decrease in water quality, the movement of salt water upstream due to rising sea levels, and the salinization of groundwater supplies will threaten inland freshwater aquaculture. Similarly, higher temperatures resulting from CC lead to reduce dissolved oxygen levels, increased fish metabolic rates, increased risk of disease spread, increased fish mortality, and consequently decreased fish production. CC may also indirectly affect aquaculture activities; for example, large areas of lowland aquaculture ponds can be highly vulnerable to flooding from rising sea levels. Thus, the current overview will briefly discuss the state of the aquaculture sector in Egypt, the meaning of CC, its causes, and its effects on the different elements of the aquaculture sector, and finally, we will review the appropriate ways to mitigate the adverse effects of CC on fish farming, especially in Egypt.</jats:p>

AB  - Effectively treating and preventing outbreaks is crucial for improving the economic benefits of aquaculture. Therefore, utilizing immunostimulants, either alone or in combination, is regarded as a promising strategy. In this study, β-glucan + APS (200 mg/kg + 200 mg/kg), β-glucan (200 mg/kg), APS (200 mg/kg), enrofloxacin (15 mg/kg), and sulfadiazine (15 mg/kg) were added to feed to assess the effects against <i>Nocardia seriolae</i> infection in largemouth bass (<i>Micropterus salmoides</i>) within 14 days. The survival rates did not differ between the enrofloxacin group and the β-glucan + APS group, but both were significantly higher than that of the control group. Additionally, the enrofloxacin group and the β-glucan + APS group exhibited the lowest bacterial loads and tissue damage. Importantly, the β-glucan + APS treatment significantly improved serum enzyme activities (total superoxide dismutase, lysozyme, total protein) and the expression of immune genes (IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IgM) compared to the other treatment groups. The enrofloxacin group showed similar efficacy to the β-glucan + APS group in combating <i>N. seriolae</i> infection, but <i>N. seriolae</i> in the enrofloxacin group developed drug resistance. In summary, the combined use of β-glucan and APS is a promising strategy for treating bacterial diseases, thereby contributing to the promotion of sustainable aquaculture development.

AB  - <i>Caligus rogercresseyi</i> is the main ectoparasite that affects the salmon industry in Chile. The mechanisms used by the parasite to support its life strategy are of great interest for developing control strategies. Due to the critical role of insect peritrophins in host-parasite interactions and response to pest control drugs, this study aimed to identify and characterize the peritrophin-like genes present in <i>C. rogercresseyi</i>. Moreover, the expression of peritrophin-like genes was evaluated on parasites exposed to delousing drugs such as pyrethroids and azamethiphos. Peritrophin genes were identified by homology analysis among the sea louse transcriptome database and arthropods peritrophin-protein database obtained from GenBank and UniProt. Moreover, the gene loci in the parasite genome were located. Furthermore, peritrophin gene expression levels were evaluated by RNA-Seq analysis in sea louse developmental stages and sea lice exposed to delousing drugs deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and azamethiphos. Seven putative peritrophin-like genes were identified in <i>C. rogercresseyi</i> with high homology with other crustacean peritrophins. Differences in the presence of signal peptides, the number of chitin-binding domains, and the position of conserved cysteines were found. In addition, seven peritrophin-like gene sequences were identified in the <i>C. rogercresseyi</i> genome. Gene expression analysis revealed a stage-dependent expression profile. Notably, differential regulation of peritrophin genes in resistant and susceptible populations to delousing drugs was found. These data are the first report and characterization of peritrophin genes in the sea louse <i>C. rogercresseyi</i>, representing valuable knowledge to understand sea louse biology. Moreover, this study provides evidence for a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of <i>C. rogercresseyi</i> response to delousing drugs.

AB  - <jats:p>Sound has a potential impact on animal welfare and production, but the impacts of soundscapes on aquaculture species in different aquaculture production systems have been rarely studied. This study investigated the impact of varying aquaculture soundscapes on largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Three soundscapes were administered to replicated tanks: Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS:107.7 dB re 1 Pa RMS), In-Pond Raceway System (IPRS:115.1 dB re 1 Pa RMS), and Ambient (70.4 dB re 1 Pa RMS) as the control. The initial weight of fish in the three groups was 3.59 ± 0.30 g. Following a 50-day experimental period, the average weight of the Ambient group (14.08 ± 0.13 g) was significantly greater than that of the IPRS group (12.79 ± 0.08 g) (p &lt; 0.05). Examination of physiological samples revealed that the soundscape negatively impacted the fish’s immunological, anti-oxidation, and digestive enzymes. Furthermore, the external noise also influenced the locomotive patterns of the fish aggregations. Fish polarity and cohesion were significantly more discrete (p &lt; 0.05) in both the RAS (47.79 ± 2.34° and 98.52 ± 3.22 mm) and IPRS groups (48.04 ± 0.70° and 87.70 ± 7.31 mm) compared to the Ambient group (42.76 ± 1.42° and 85.73 ± 1.57 mm). These results highlight the significant impacts of the aquaculture soundscape on the development, physiological activities, and behavioral traits of largemouth bass. Future research should focus on determining and optimizing the impact of different equipment noise to ensure optimal welfare and production performance in aquaculture systems.</jats:p>

AB  - Aquaculture of the lumpfish (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i> L.) has become a large, lucrative industry owing to the escalating demand for "cleaner fish" to minimise sea lice infestations in Atlantic salmon mariculture farms. We used over 10K genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate the spatial patterns of genomic variation in the lumpfish along the coast of Norway and across the North Atlantic. Moreover, we applied three genome scans for outliers and two genotype-environment association tests to assess the signatures and patterns of local adaptation under extensive gene flow. With our 'global' sampling regime, we found two major genetic groups of lumpfish, i.e., the western and eastern Atlantic. Regionally in Norway, we found marginal evidence of population structure, where the population genomic analysis revealed a small portion of individuals with a different genetic ancestry. Nevertheless, we found strong support for local adaption under high gene flow in the Norwegian lumpfish and identified over 380 high-confidence environment-associated loci linked to gene sets with a key role in biological processes associated with environmental pressures and embryonic development. Our results bridge population genetic/genomics studies with seascape genomics studies and will facilitate genome-enabled monitoring of the genetic impacts of escapees and allow for genetic-informed broodstock selection and management in Norway.

AB  - Aquaculture in the Patagonian fjords and channels has experienced sustained growth during the last four decades, despite the lack of knowledge on the magnitude and intensity of its impacts. Based on a review of the latest literature, this chapter summarizes its main negative risks and delivers four recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of severe impacts on these ecosystems in a changing context. We highlight the urgent need to prevent regional and ecosystem problems. Relevant regulatory changes are required in accordance with the intensity and distribution of industrial activity. They include the implementation of an adequate monitoring system and the creation of an integrated system to effectively manage marine protected areas. Following a precautionary principle, in the short term we recommend halting the productive and territorial expansion of aquaculture, initiating essential changes to the current legislation on salmon escapes, limiting the use of chemotherapeutics and increasing public and private investment in the research and development of monitoring and mitigation technologies. The research priority should be the development of reliable assessments of carrying capacity and effective mechanisms to protect communities and species potentially threatened by this activity.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Atlantic salmon post-spawners from a population in northern Norway were tagged with data storage tags (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 773), and the depth use and diving behaviour of recaptured individuals within the coastal zone were examined, both on their outward migration to sea (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 44) and their return to the natal river after overwintering at sea (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 34). In addition, the stomach contents of 909 returning adults caught in the fjord were examined to determine the extent to which, how recently and on what species they had fed. The tagged individuals migrated through surface waters and performed aperiodic dives, regardless of whether they were leaving the fjord as post-spawners (kelts) or returning after a winter or more at sea. However, diving behaviour differed between the fjord and outer coast. During both outward and return migration, dives when fish were likely in the fjord were shallower than on the outer coast. Deep dives of longer duration were more frequent on the outer coast than in the fjord. The stomach content analysis of salmon captured in the fjord did not show strong evidence of recent feeding: 58% of the salmon had empty stomachs, and most stomach contents were highly digested fish (mainly herring, but some capelin and unidentifiable species). We conclude that the inferred diving behaviour in the coastal zone, both on outward migration to sea and on return to the natal river, did not provide sufficient evidence of foraging within the water column, and hypothesize that diving in search for navigation cues is a more likely explanation.</jats:p>

AB  - One of the main products of pyrolysis is char. For the better performance and improvement of its physicochemical properties, it is necessary to make temperature changes. In this study, different temperatures have been tested for the pyrolysis of rice husk, and the biochar obtained from the process went through an evaluation to test its yield in the removal of emerging compounds such as azithromycin (AZT) and erythromycin (ERY). For this, pyrolysis of rice husk has been carried out at temperatures of 450, 500, 550, and 600 °C, and the biochars have been characterized by ultimate analysis and proximate analysis, as well as specific surface area tests. Then, different adsorption tests have been carried out with a 200 mg L<sup>-1</sup> drug (AZT and ERY) solution prepared in the laboratory. All biochars have been found to present removal percentages higher than 95%. Therefore, obtaining biochar from rice husk at any temperature and using it in the removal of high-molecular-weight compounds are quite suitable.

The bulk of these inputs was used for soil and water quality improvement and had low environmental and human safety concerns. The multivariate analysis revealed significant variation in the frequency and quantity of compounds use among farm groups. Redundancy analysis revealed a significant association between the number of products used and stocking density. The survey also showed a considerable influence of education and farming experience on the usage pattern of aquaculture inputs. Results of the study indicated greater reliance of farmers on the use of disinfectants for biosecurity, nutritional supplements for enhanced growth and environmental modifiers for maintaining soil and water quality in culture systems. Though there was no use of restricted antibiotics and antiparasitic agents, the development and implementation of standard regulatory guidelines are essential for safe and effective use of inputs for sustainable aquaculture.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>We predicted small-scale hydrodynamics, including the effect of the aquaculture farming infrastructure, for a region within the group of salmon farm concessions identified in the Chilean regulation as ACS-7. The geographical region corresponds to the Caucahue Channel, composed of two branches connected by a constriction on Caucahue Island, Inland Sea of Chiloe, Chilean Patagonia. The prediction methodology considers the interaction of a regional ocean model and a high-resolution local CFD model. The model prediction was validated using available data from ADCP. We find that the Caucahue Channel is characterized by a complex circulation and hydrodynamics, including an unstable shear flow, with meanders and turbulent structures, and retention zones. Results show the aquaculture infrastructure has a non-local hydrodynamic effect. Differences in horizontal and vertical velocity can be quite significant even far from aquaculture centers, reaching up to 300% and 170%, respectively, in simulations without taking its effects into account. The useful characteristics of this predictive approach and its potential use in particle tracking and species diffusion prediction allow for the use of projecting as a tool for strengthening the environmental and productive management of this industry.</jats:p>

AB  - Species distribution modeling helps understand how environmental factors influence species distribution, creating profiles to predict presence in unexplored areas and assess ecological impacts. This study examined the habitat use and population ecology of the Chilean dolphin in Seno Skyring, Chilean Patagonia. We used three models-random forest (RF), generalized linear model (GLM), and artificial neural network (ANN)-to predict dolphin distribution based on environmental and biotic data like water temperature, salinity, and fish farm density. Our research has determined that the RF model is the most precise tool for predicting the habitat preferences of Chilean dolphins. The results indicate that these dolphins are primarily located within six kilometers of the coast, strongly correlating with areas featuring numerous fish farms, sheltered waters close to the shore with river inputs, and shallow productive zones. This suggests a potential association between dolphin presence and fish-farming activities. These findings can guide targeted conservation measures, such as regulating fish-farming practices and protecting vital coastal areas to improve the survival prospects of the Chilean dolphin. Given the extensive fish-farming industry in Chile, this research highlights the need for greater knowledge and comprehensive conservation efforts to ensure the species' long-term survival. By understanding and mitigating the impacts of fish farming and other human activities, we can better protect the habitat and well-being of Chilean dolphins.

AB  - Little is known about how escaped farmed Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. affect the envi- ronment, but the potential for negative ecological consequences might be significant. In this study, the movements of adult farmed north-east Arctic cod (NEAC) and Norwegian coastal cod (NCC) were mapped after a simulated escape from an aquaculture farm to evaluate if post-escape move- ments and potential for recapture differs between these 2 genotypes. There was no major difference between NEAC and NCC equipped with acoustic transmitters with respect to spatiotemporal distri- bution or swimming depth during a 10 wk period after simulated escape incidents. The tagged cod immediately descended to average depths <20 m, and subsequently were most frequently observed along the shore. A substantial proportion of the farmed cod released at the cod farm left within the first week, while cod released at a nearby mussel farm were attracted to the cod farm. Beyond Week 2, the fish detected at the cod farm consisted of approximately similar proportions of fish released at either the mussel or cod farm. One third of the tagged cod was recaptured in local small- scale commercial and recreational fisheries during the first 3 wk after release. Thus, our results indicate that organised recapture fishery is a realistic option for reducing possible ecological and genetic impacts of escaped farmed cod. Such fishery must, however, be initiated as soon as possible after an escape incident and there is a need for development of a methodology for rapid detection and efficient recapture of escapees.

AB  - During recent years, the use of functional ingredients in aquaculture industry has increased dramatically. Accordingly, there are a broad range of functional feeds available for use in fish farming. As a result, there is ongoing research which focuses on developing oral delivery systems for fish. Variety of products can be incorporated into alginate matrices to avoid damage from the low pH and proteolytic enzymes encountered in the digestive tract of fish. However, there has been very little research reported on the effectiveness of those oral delivery systems with respect to performance within fish feed and fish. Furthermore, the reported particle sizes used within alginate delivery systems require further reduction to be suitable for effective association within feed pellets. Additionally, it is essential that active compounds are released at the right place in fish. In this study, encapsulation technology capable of providing an economical and high throughput method for producing fine alginate beads (≤10 µm) was assessed. Post-coating examination with the micro-tomography (micro-CT) equipment confirmed the presence of alginate particles inside the pellet in large numbers. According to our observations in an enzyme assay, the active compounds are released at the most favourable site in Atlantic salmon which is the distal intestine. There is also evidence to suggest that alginateencapsulated protein antigens when released in the intestine are capable of crossing the intestinal epithelial layer. Similarly, in the assessment of intraperitoneal priming/oral boosting strategy against infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN), alginate-encapsulated IPN antigens boosted immune response in salmon. This could be seen in significant up-regulation of relevant genes measured by quantitative PCR and specific antibody response detected in an ELISA assay. The results of these investigative studies significantly improve understanding of the issues regarding incorporation of delivery systems into fish feed in the current manufacturing process leading to a novel approach for functionalizing fish feed.

AB  - As aquaculture expands, regulation to prevent environmental damage is an essential requirement for sustainability. In this paper, we discuss three aspects of aquaculture regulation pertaining to 1) protection of other resource users, 2) protection of ecosystem structure (conservation), and 3) protection of ecosystem function (recycling). Some of the approaches taken to regulation of aquaculture in several countries are presented, emphasizing the need for these to be based firmly in a good scientific understanding of the ecosystem and the processes by which it interacts with aquaculture.

AB  - Many environmental impacts can be attributed to fish farming and there is a need to explore new ways of reducing environmental impacts, such as fish genetic improvement. The environmental consequences of genetic improvement in thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and in feed conversion ratio (FCR) were investigated, therefore, in an African catfish farm in Recirculating Aquaculture System. A Life Cycle Assessment study was conducted and combined with a bioeconomic model of genetic response. Results show that environmental consequences of genetic improvement in TGC and FCR are different among impact categories, depending on their main contributors and on the factor limiting production at farm level. Genetic improvement of FCR always leads to lower environmental impacts while improving TGC decreases environmental impacts only when density was the limiting factor. Those results are important for the future development of selective breeding programs in fish farming taking into account environmental impacts.

               <jats:p>Aquaculture is providing an increasingly larger proportion of the world’s protein for human consumption; however, its environmental impact is a bottleneck for sustainable expansion. In Norway, the government has enacted a framework where salmon lice-induced mortality in wild salmonid populations is used for assessing the environmental sustainability in production zones. Direct measurements of the level of lice-induced mortality on wild salmonids are difficult to acquire, thus comprehensive sustainability assessments are based on a set of evidence-based proxies. One such proxy is the infestation pressure from a bio-hydrodynamic model, from which we develop an index that summarize the sustainability of aquaculture in terms of lice infestation. This index is based on the proportion of areas with elevated lice loads, and is a novel approach used to investigate how sustainability could be achieved through scenario testing of different management strategies. The analyses identified a mismatch between legal and sustainable lice levels, but also a beneficial effect of reducing lice levels on farms. This study’s approach demonstrated how bio-hydrodynamic models might be used to assess sustainability and to predict the necessary reduction of lice larvae from farms to classify the entire Norwegian aquaculture industry as environmentally sustainable.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Host behaviour can prevent infection and moderate the fitness of parasites. Antiparasite behaviours are prevalent in many host–parasite systems and occur over fine or broad scales. With global growth in aquaculture production and the associated proliferation of parasites in farming systems, the behaviour of the fish being farmed has seldom been investigated in relation to parasites. Epidemics and outbreaks of parasites are prevalent in most aquaculture systems, and behaviour could be harnessed in concert with current methods to prevent and control parasites and pathogens. However, this requires a systematic understanding of the behaviours of hosts, their capacity for resistance and their interaction with the environment and the parasite. Herein, we present evidence for how behaviour could be used in aquaculture, and discuss the possibility for behaviour to be used in aquaculture as (i) an indicator of welfare status, (ii) a tool in prevention or control and (iii) to maintain or improve welfare. We apply this framework to a case study of a highly problematic parasite, the salmon louse (<jats:italic>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</jats:italic>), on farmed Atlantic salmon (<jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>). We present the current state of the system, and the drawbacks of current control or prevention methods. We synergise current knowledge on host behaviours and show how behaviour could be incorporated into current and new approaches for prevention and control. Through this first evaluation of the possibilities behaviour presents in disease management, we aim to facilitate a shift in the current disease control paradigm from reactive‐based post‐infection control to pre‐infection prevention approaches.</jats:p>

AB  - Taxonomic and functional microbial communities may respond differently to anthropogenic coastal impacts, but ecological quality monitoring assessments using environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/eRNA) in response to pollution are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the utility of the co-occurrence network approach's to comprehensively explore both structure and potential functions of benthic marine microbial communities and their responses to Cu and Fe fractioning from two sediment deposition coastal zones of northern Chile <i>via</i> 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. The results revealed substantial differences in the microbial communities, with the predominance of two distinct module hubs based on study zone. This indicates that habitat influences microbial co-occurrence networks. Indeed, the discriminant analysis allowed us to identify keystone taxa with significant differences in eDNA and eRNA comparison between sampled zones, revealing that <i>Beggiatoaceae</i>, <i>Carnobacteriaceae</i>, and <i>Nitrosococcaceae</i> were the primary representatives from Off Loa, whereas <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Corynebacteriaceae</i>, <i>Latescibacteraceae</i>, and <i>Clostridiaceae</i> were the families responsible for the observed changes in Mejillones Bay. The quantitative evidence from the multivariate analyses supports that the benthic microbial assemblages' features were linked to specific environments associated with Cu and Fe fractions, mainly in the Bay. Furthermore, the predicted functional microbial structure suggested that transporters and DNA repair allow the communities to respond to metals and endure the interacting variable environmental factors like dissolved oxygen, temperature, and salinity. Moreover, some active taxa recovered are associated with anthropogenic impact, potentially harboring antibiotic resistance and other threats in the coastal zone. Overall, the method of scoping eRNA in parallel with eDNA applied here has the capacity to significantly enhance the spatial and functional understanding of real-time microbial assemblages and, in turn, would have the potential to increase the acuity of biomonitoring programs key to responding to immediate management needs for the marine environment.

AB  - In recent years, social and environmental conflicts concerning the aquaculture sector have increased. These conflicts arise from the different perception that individuals, collectives, private companies and the State have about the potential impacts of aquaculture on the environment and quality of life. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of aquaculture projects in Chile is the main administrative tool for decision-making, allowing identify, predict, and propose preventive measures to mitigate negative consequences of this growing sector. This article analyzes the performance of the EIA in Chile concerning aquaculture projects between 1994 and 2019. Of the 5323 projects entering the Chilean EIA during this period, the EIA system-performance analysis selected the 71 most representative. For a reliable comparative analysis, the selected projects were first classified in accordance with the active regulation within the period. Subsequently, 14 performance indicators were selected and similarities—by means of a principal coordinate analysis—were explored. Significant differences between the third (SD40) and the first two (SD30 and SD95) regulations were observed. Based on these results and considering demands of local communities and social leaders (who request continuous articulations among technical areas, administrative tools, and policies to increase the sustainability standards of aquaculture), four opportunities for improving the EIA in aquaculture projects are proposed: incorporation of synergistic and cumulative effects, adaptation to climate change, development of a general methodology, and incorporation of early citizen participation (in projects having environmental charge) increasing the performance and confidence of the EIA. The introduced methodology enables comparisons of the EIA process in different regulatory periods using indicators, serving as guidance to evaluate the performance of the EIA in aquaculture. This methodology can also be used by other aquaculture producing countries around the world.

Paper 1 Innovation and Productivity Growth in Norwegian Production of Juvenile Salmonids. A number of studies have documented a rapid productivity growth and a decline in production cost in Norwegian salmon farming. However, little attention has been given to productivity growth of the input factors. Two thirds of the reduction in costs that has taken place in Norwegian salmon grow-out farming can be attributed to better and cheaper inputs. If one is to obtain a better understanding of the factors that enhance the productivity and competitiveness of salmon aquaculture, it is important to study the development of the suppliers. This paper provides an analysis of productivity growth for one key input factor in salmon farming, juvenile salmon. This issue is addressed by the use of conventional econometric methods were we construct translog cost functions. The dataset is an unbalanced panel data set with 1802 observations. We have access to 23 years of firm level data from 1988 to 2010 from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. The data set contain 70-115 hatcheries yearly out

AB  - Chile is the second largest producer of salmon in the world and is an important pillar of the national economy. Any disruption in how the industry functions will have economic and social effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Chilean salmon industry. An online survey was sent to the highest positions in the industry: presidents, managers, and chiefs of salmon companies. Of the 52 respondents, 75% indicated that operations were moderately affected by the pandemic. More than 70% reported a decrease in their company's production and sales. Work absenteeism was a concern for 88%, and the implementation of sanitary measures was considered effective and relevant to prevent the spread of the virus. However, there were no statistically significant differences (p-value > 0.05) between the degree of impact on operations by company size, or between absenteeism and company size. The information obtained in this study is a first look into understanding the impacts of the pandemic on the Chilean salmon industry in the year 2020.

AB  - Abstract –  In many prey fish species, learning the identity of novel predators may be facilitated when novel predator cues and an aversive stimulus are presented together. Damage-released chemical alarm cues are typically released from the skin of prey individuals following mechanical damage and are known to mediate the learned recognition of novel predators. While such chemically mediated acquired predator recognition can provide increased survival benefits to prey, environmental constraints impeding learning may exist. For example, in several fish species the ability to detect chemical alarm cues is impaired in under acidic conditions and as such, inhibits this chemically mediated learning. In this experiment, we studied in two streams of different mean acidity level (pH c. 6.0 and 7.0), to assess if wild juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) had the ability to acquire the recognition of a novel lemon essence odour when paired with conspecific chemical alarm cues. Our results demonstrate that under acidic conditions, no learned recognition of the novel odour occurred. In neutral conditions, however, salmon recognised the novel odour as a predation threat. This result suggests that ambient acidity creates an environmental constraint on chemically mediated learned recognition of a novel cue.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii, a parasitic protozoan, may infect most warm-blooded animals, including humans and carnivores. Our study focused on alien-invasive American minks (Neogale vison) and domestic cats (Felis catus) in the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest, Chile. The main goal was to investigate the relationship between their dietary habits and T. gondii exposure in the Valdivia River watershed. To detect T. gondii exposure, blood serum samples from 49 domestic cats and 40 American minks were analyzed using an ELISA, and stable isotope analysis of δ15N and δ13C from vibrissae was performed to determine the dietary habits of both species. Relationships between T. gondii exposure and dietary habits were explored using generalized linear mixed-effects models. American minks that were T. gondii seropositive exhibited a broader prey range compared to seropositive domestic cats, with minimal dietary overlap between the two groups. Exposure of domestic cats to T. gondii had no significant association with any isotope value or prey item in their diet. In American minks, we found a positive and significant association between the proportion of Domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) in the diet and high δ15N values with T. gondii exposure. This suggests that domestic species prey related to anthropogenic areas, and the consumption of high-trophic-level prey, may contribute to T. gondii exposure in American minks. Conversely, contrary to previous hypotheses, consumption of rodents showed no significant association with T. gondii exposure in either species. Our findings emphasize the importance of further research to investigate trophic interactions in the transmission dynamics of T. gondii in the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest.

AB  - Fisheries and aquaculture production, imports, exports and equitability of distribution determine the supply of aquatic food to people. Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand.

AB  - The largest companies in salmon aquaculture are rapidly getting bigger due to organic growth as well as mergers and acquisitions, and the largest are now multi-national companies. There are two main explanations for this growth: 1) An attempt to become large enough to exploit market power, or 2) Size is necessary to adopt new technologies that increase the efficient scale. In this paper, we investigate the degree of concentration in each of the main producer countries for Atlantic salmon, as well as globally for Atlantic salmon, all farmed salmon, and all salmon to account for the global nature of the market using Herfindahl-Hirschman Indexes. The results indicate a high degree of concentration in the smaller producer nations but not in Chile and Norway. Globally, the Atlantic salmon industry can be characterized as unconcentrated, and it becomes even more so when the supply of other farmed salmon and wild salmon is accounted for. Hence, the main motivation for the increased company size appears to be capacity to adopt new knowledge and technology.

AB  - Expansion of marine aquaculture into more remote areas will likely accelerate over the next decade. Integrating Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) generation technologies (e.g., wind turbines) into remote, off-grid aquaculture sites will reduce reliance on fossil fuels by allowing localised low-carbon power generation, but may also result in novel environmental pressures. In this study, we undertook a thought experiment to assess the potential for increased collision risks to local marine and coastal bird species of integrating small wind turbines (4 units; combined capacity of 200 MWh) into a generalised marine fish farm in western Scotland (UK). Potential risks to bird species were assessed using a bespoke Sensitivity Index (SI) based on 12 factors, including population size, adult survival rate, UK conservation status, flight manoeuvrability, nocturnal flight activity, habitat preference, sensitivity to wind farms, attraction to fish farms for feeding and/or resting, and attraction to other marine anthropogenic structures/activities. SI scores varied substantially between species, but large gulls (Larus sp.) and European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) were expected to be at the greatest potential risk. The general lack of information on interactions between birds and fish farms represented a significant knowledge gap, and greater focus on these interactions is needed to improve future risk assessments.

AB  - Sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer) are a major ectoparasite affecting farmed Atlantic salmon in most major salmon producing regions. Substantial resources are applied to sea lice control and the development of new technologies towards this end. Identifying and understanding how sea lice population patterns vary among cages on a salmon farm can be an important step in the design and analysis of any sea lice control strategy. Norway's intense monitoring efforts have provided salmon farmers and researchers with a wealth of sea lice infestation data. A frequently registered parameter is the number of adult female sea lice per cage. These time-series data can be analysed descriptively, the similarity between time-series quantified, so that groups and patterns can be identified among cages, using clustering algorithms capable of handling such dynamic data. We apply such algorithms to investigate the pattern of female sea lice counts among cages for three Atlantic salmon farms in Norway. A series of strategies involving a combination of distance measures and prototypes were explored and cluster evaluation was performed using cluster validity indices. Repeated agreement on cluster membership for different combinations of distance and centroids was taken to be a strong indicator of clustering while the stability of these results reinforced this likelihood. Though drivers behind clustering are not thoroughly investigated here, it appeared that fish weight at time of stocking and other management practices were strongly related to cluster membership. In addition to these internally driven factors it is also possible that external sources of infestation may drive patterns of sea lice infestation in groups of cages; for example, those most proximal to an external source. This exploratory method proved useful as a pattern discovery tool for cages in salmon farms.

AB  - The economic benefits of an aquaculture-hydroponic integrated system are evaluated using a hydroponic-lettuce and barramundi fish production system as a case study. Technical data were obtained for a case study farm located at Port Stephens, New South Wales, Australia. The net present values of annual cash flows over a 10-year planning horizon were determined for barramundi and lettuce production as stand-alone units, and alternatively as integrated units, using a capital budgeting framework. Integrated production enables barramundi effluent to be used as a source of nutrients for the lettuce production. This results in an increase in net benefits equal to the reduction in barramundi effluent disposal costs, and the saving of some water and nutrient costs of the lettuce system.

AB  - The paper reviews a range of global aquaculture health and safety literature to inform and contribute to the development of a socio-economic profile of Indian shrimp farm workers including the occupational hazards and injuries they face. In addition, 60 shrimp farm workers were interviewed from each of the states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. The study revealed that all shrimp farm workers were male, 58% were migrants, and ages ranged from 23 to 53 years with work experience of 5 to 24 years. Few workers (14%) had no formal schooling and many had secondary-level education. Reported physical hazards were high (93%) followed by biological (82%), chemical (77%), ergonomic (71%) and psycho-social (71%) hazards. The majority of physical injuries reported related to slips, falls and cuts (51%), electric shocks (44%), sunburn (41%), dehydration/headaches (40%) and fractures (27%). Approximately 30%–39% had some chemical injury with skin infections/breathing problems. Indian shrimp farm workers face similar occupational hazards and injuries to shrimp farm workers in other countries. The occupational health and safety of shrimp farm workers should be integrated into the concept of 'One Health' to ensure aquaculture sustainability and safe, meaningful and good quality employment to workers.

AB  - The spread of bacterial drug resistance has posed a severe threat to public health globally. Here, we cover bacterial resistance to current antibacterial drugs, including traditional herbal medicines, conventional antibiotics, and antimicrobial peptides. We summarize the influence of bacterial drug resistance on global health and its economic burden while highlighting the resistance mechanisms developed by bacteria. Based on the One Health concept, we propose 4A strategies to combat bacterial resistance, including prudent Application of antibacterial agents, Administration, Assays, and Alternatives to antibiotics. Finally, we identify several opportunities and unsolved questions warranting future exploration for combating bacterial resistance, such as predicting genetic bacterial resistance through the use of more effective techniques, surveying both genetic determinants of bacterial resistance and the transmission dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).

AB  - Fish farming in sea cages is a growing component of the global food industry. A prominent ecosystem impact of this industry is the increase in the downward flux of organic matter, which stimulates anaerobic mineralization and sulfide production in underlying sediments. When free sulfide is released to the overlying water, this can have a toxic effect on local marine ecosystems. The microbially-mediated process of sulfide oxidation has the potential to be an important natural mitigation and prevention strategy that has not been studied in fish farm sediments. We examined the microbial community composition (DNA-based 16S rRNA gene) underneath two active fish farms on the Southwestern coast of Iceland and performed laboratory incubations of resident sediment. Field observations confirmed the strong geochemical impact of fish farming on the sediment (up to 150 m away from cages). Sulfide accumulation was evidenced under the cages congruent with a higher supply of degradable organic matter from the cages. Phylogenetically diverse microbes capable of sulfide detoxification were present in the field sediment as well as in lab incubations, including cable bacteria (<i>Candidatus</i> Electrothrix), which display a unique metabolism based on long-distance electron transport. Microsensor profiling revealed that the activity of cable bacteria did not exert a dominant impact on the geochemistry of fish farm sediment at the time of sampling. However, laboratory incubations that mimic the recovery process during fallowing, revealed successful enrichment of cable bacteria within weeks, with concomitant high sulfur-oxidizing activity. Overall our results give insight into the role of microbially-mediated sulfide detoxification in aquaculture impacted sediments.

AB  - <jats:p>Seaweed culture is of great significance in giving full play to the function of marine carbon sequestration and strengthening the protection and repair of the marine ecosystem. Its green efficiency measurement can provide China with a means for a global low-carbon economy. From the ecological perspective of net carbon sink, this paper selects three indexes: input, expected output and unexpected output. The total carbon sink and carbon emissions are included in the evaluation index system of green efficiency of seaweed culture in China. The green efficiency of seaweed culture in China from 2008 to 2020 is calculated by the super-SBM model. Through the redundancy rate of input and output, the influencing factors of net carbon sink output of seaweed culture are put forward. According to the empirical calculation results and influencing factors of green efficiency, the countermeasures and suggestions for green seaweed culture in China under the dual-carbon target are put forward. The results showed that: (1) the net carbon sink and green efficiency level of seaweed culture in China showed an overall growth trend, and there was a lot of room for growth in economic and ecological benefits; (2) influenced by index factors and non-index factors such as marine resource economy and planning, there are differences in seaweed culture and green efficiency in the three major sea areas of China; (3) the indexes of green efficiency of seaweed culture in different study areas are different; and (4) the improvement of green efficiency can promote the Chinese seaweed culture industry. Green technology progress effect, structure effect, and input–output scale effect are the main influencing mechanisms of green efficiency of seaweed culture. It is suggested that in the future, we should optimize the structure of seaweed culture, innovate seaweed culture technology, improve carbon sink trading policy and strengthen the training of carbon sink talents. This will accelerate the realization of the goal of green and double carbon seaweed culture and promote the global low-carbon economy.</jats:p>

AB  - ABSTRACTThis article contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the sustainability of fishmeal and fish oil in aquaculture diets. It demonstrates why the “Fish In, Fish Out” metric, which is frequently used to show how many units of wild fish is needed to produce one unit of farmed fish, is not a valid tool for measuring the sustainability or efficiency of aquaculture production. Additionally, the metric diverts attention away from the human health implications of how we raise fish. It substitutes the mass of seafood for the arguably more important value-added dimension – the long chain omega-3 content per unit mass, which is low in fish raised on diets low in marine ingredients. Fishmeal and fish oil produced by sustainable fisheries remain some of the most ecologically efficient ingredients that contribute to the overall gain of seafood biomass. Because many aspects of our health and wellbeing depend on wild fisheries, we must insist on well-managed fish harvest for the health of the world's population

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Healthy populations of salmonids are integral for the functioning of ecosystems and a valuable part of sociocultural identities. Past declines were attributed to anthropogenic stressors, raising concern about the sustainability of populations. Accordingly, many salmonids are listed on red lists and protected by national legislation. One region where salmonid populations are threatened is Northern Spain, the most southern distribution of both the Atlantic salmon (protected under the EU Habitat Directive) and the brown trout. Here, we collated ~700 biomonitoring samples of both species collected across 177 sites over a 10‐year period (2010–2019) to describe ongoing trends in these species and to relate them to site characteristics and potential drivers which may modulate these trends. We showed that both species have declined substantially, with stocked individuals constituting the majority of both populations. Natural reproduction was almost entirely absent for the brown trout (&lt;1%), but present in the Atlantic salmon (~20%). Both species expressed distinct spatial patterns, likely related to their stocking and habitat preferences. As a result, we not only underline alarming conditions of both species, but also question the effectiveness of currently employed stocking efforts. Given that both species are of increasing conservation concern, river basin‐specific analyses are required to identify limiting factors on which conservation actions can be taken. In the evaluated river systems, identified targets include dam removal and pollution reduction, concomitant to the implementation of more effective stocking practices to reduce dependency and maximise conservation benefits for aquatic populations.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The farming mode of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola aureovittata) in China tends to be mature. However, there are some problems with environmental impact and economic benefits that cannot be ignored in the sustainable farming process. This study focused on a yellowtail kingfish aquaculture company in Dalian, China, and carried out a life cycle environmental and cost assessment (LCA and LCC) study to evaluate the environmental impact and economic benefits of the yellowtail kingfish farming process. According to the LCA and LCC results, the environmental impact is significantly influenced by fossil energy consumption and feed production. Moreover, five improvement scenarios were proposed and discussed, and the results show that replacing coal and thermal power generation with wind power generation will comprehensively (scenario 5) reduce environmental impact by 82.14% and decrease costs by 24.25%. The results of this study can provide effective improvement scenarios for yellowtail kingfish aquaculture enterprises and enrich the international aquaculture LCA basic database with data support.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>With the rapid growth of the aquaculture production since the 1980s, there has been a concomitant increase in disease outbreaks. The injudicious and/or incorrect use of antimicrobial agents against diseases of farmed aquatic species poses a considerable threat to the development and growth of a successful and sustainable aquaculture industry. An increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important consequence, resulting to the difficulty in treating common bacterial diseases in populations of aquatic organisms, combined with the presence of antibiotic residues in food fish and their products, leading to import refusals and negative impacts on international trade. To reduce the frequency of AMR, good aquaculture and effective biosecurity practices should include the prudent and responsible use of antibiotics and also consider the use of alternatives to antibiotics, in addition to disease prevention management. This article reviews the literature discussing the scope of the problem pertaining to antibiotic use, the emergence of AMR in aquaculture and to consider and discuss viable alternatives (e.g., vaccination, bacteriophages, quorum quenching, probiotics and prebiotics, chicken egg yolk antibody and medicinal plant derivative). We also discuss lessons learnt, from specific case studies such as the vaccination of farmed salmon in Norway and the use of ‘specific pathogen‐free’ seed—as primary and essential part of a biosecurity strategy.</jats:p>

AB  - In this article, the definition of sustainability is discussed, particularly in relation to the use of marine feed resources. The current review gives an overview of the development of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture and how it has evolved due to changes in legal and management framework conditions. Atlantic salmon production is characterized with high utilization of nutrients, a high yield of production, and a large demand for rendered by-products. All of these factors compare favorably to production of most terrestrial farm animals. Historically, salmon feed has contained fishmeal and fish oil as the primary protein and fat source. Rising demand for feed ingredients has not increased pressure on forage fish resources. Rather, there has been an increased use of plant protein and fat sources. Increased utilization of plant ingredients may not be as sustainable as often claimed. Provided that marine harvest is carried out within legal frames, harvesting the marine ecosystem is a sustainable opera...

AB  - <jats:p>While aquaculture is predicted to play a significant role in addressing future global food demands, climate change is having a complex impact on aquaculture output. Climate change will have an effect on output levels, growth, feeding efficiency, and consequently farm productivity and profitability. The most significant challenges facing aquaculture are current and future climate change, which affects the viability of fish farming in Norway and around the world. Global warming and climate change have resulted in a decline in lake waters, an increase in sea level, changes in streams, and changes in precipitation models, all of which have begun to have a negative influence on all aquatic animals. According to the findings of this study, the yearly maximum temperature was 21.1 °C in July and the lowest was -2.8 °C in January, with the minimum temperature ranging from 13.5 °C in July to -7.5 °C in January. The highest average temperature was 17.4 °C in July, and the lowest was -5.1 °C in January. In terms of precipitation, the greatest was 118 mm in August, while the lowest was 56 mm in March. In terms of rainy days, the highest total was 11 mm in August, while the lowest total was 6 mm in March. In November, the humidity reached 90%, whereas in June, it was 66%. On bright days, the highest daylight hours were recorded in June at 12.1 hours, and the lowest hours were recorded in December at 2.5 hours. In this research, we explicitly investigated how these climate components may affect aquaculture in Norway. As a result, because it affects the stability of fish farming, this significant environmental issue must be addressed. It is critical to shed light on and thoroughly analyse the elements related to climate change in order to avoid the damages that result from them, as well as to identify strategies to adapt to these conditions and limit their effects on production and productivity. Corrective efforts should be implemented to reduce climate change and its consequences on fish output.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract  – Among the species in the family Salmonidae, those represented by the genera Salmo, Salvelinus, and Oncorhynchus (subfamily Salmoninae) are the most studied. Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10 cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3–5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.

AB  - The interest in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is growing due to their benefits such as increased productivity, better control over animal care, reduced environmental effects, and less water consumption. However, in some regions of the world, traditional aquaculture methods remain prevalent, and selective breeding has often been designed for performance within these systems. Therefore, it is important to evaluate how current fish populations fare in RAS to guide future breeding choices. In a commercial setting, we explore the genetic structure of growth characteristics, measure genotype-environment interactions (GxE) in salmon smolts, and examine genetic markers related to growth in freshwater lochs and RAS. Young salmon were raised together until they reached the parr stage, after which they were divided equally between freshwater net-pens and RAS. After an 8-week period, we sampled fish from each environment and genotyped them. Our findings revealed that fish reared in RAS were generally smaller in weight and length but exhibited a higher condition factor and uniformity. We found a notably smaller component of unexplained variance in the RAS, leading to higher heritability estimates. We observed a low GxE effect for length and condition factor, but significant re-ranking for whole-body weight, as well as noticeable differences in trait associations across environments. Specifically, a segment of chromosome 22 was found to be linked with the condition factor in the RAS population only. Results suggests that if the use of RAS continues to expand, the efficiency of existing commercial populations may not reach its full potential unless breeding programs specific to RAS are implemented.

AB  - article i nfo In 1990, 90% of the ingredients in Norwegian salmon feed were of marine origin, whereas in 2013 only around 30%. The contents of fish meal and fish oil in the salmon feed were 18% and 11%, respectively, in 2013. Between 2010 and 2013, salmon production in Norway increased by 30%, but due to a lower inclusion of marine ingredientsinthediet,thetotalamountofmarineingredientsusedforsalmonfeedproductionwasreducedfrom 544,000 to 466,000 tonnes. Norwegian salmon farming consumed 1.63 million tonnes of feed ingredients in 2012, containing close to 40 million GJ of energy, 580,000 tonnes of protein and 530,000 tonnes of lipid. 1.26 million tonnes of salmon was produced. Assuming an edible yield of 65%, 820,000 tonnes of salmon fillet, containing 9.44 million GJ, and 156,000 tonnes of protein were produced. The retentions of protein and energy inthe edibleproductin2012were 27% and24%,respectively. Ofthe43,000 tonnes ofEPAand DHAinthesalmon feed in 2012, around 11,000 tonnes were retained in the edible part of salmon. The retentions of EPA and DHA were 46% in whole salmon and 26% in fillets, respectively. The fish in/fish out ratio (FIFO) measures the amount of fish meal and fish oil that is used to produce one weight equivalent of farmed fish back to wild fish weight equiva- lents, and the forage fish dependency ratio (FFDR) is the amount of wild caught fish used to produce the amount of fish meal and fish oil required to produce 1 kg of salmon. From 1990 to 2013, the forage fish dependency ratio for fish meal decreased from 4.4 to 0.7 in Norwegian salmon farming. However, weight-to-weight ratios such as FIFO and FFDR do not account for the different nutrient contents in the salmon product and in the forage fish used for fish meal and fish oil production. Marine nutrient dependency ratios express the amount of marine oil and protein required to produce 1 kg of salmon oil and protein. In 2013, 0.7 kg of marine protein was used to produce 1 kg of salmon protein, so the Norwegian farmed salmon is thus a net producer of marine protein.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Aquaculture is playing an increasingly important role in global food security, especially for low-income and food-deficit countries. The majority of aquaculture production occurs in freshwater earthen ponds and tilapia has quickly become one of the most widely adopted culture species in these systems. Tilapia are now farmed in over 140 countries facilitated by their ease of production, adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions, fast growth, and high nutritional value. Typically, tilapia have been considered a hardy, disease resilient species; however, the disease is increasing with subsequent threats to the industry as their production is intensified. In this review, we discuss tilapia production, with a focus on Bangladesh as one of the top producing countries, and highlight the problems associated with disease and treatment approaches for them, including the misuse of antimicrobials. We address a key missing component in understanding health and disease processes for sustainable production in aquaculture, specifically the role played by the microbiome. Here we examine the importance of the microbiome in supporting health, focused on the symbiotic microbial community of the fish skin mucosal surface, the abiotic and biotic factors that influence the microbiome, and the shifts that are associated with diseased states. We also identify conserved taxa of skin microbiomes that may be used as indicators of health status for tilapia offering new opportunities to mitigate and manage the disease and optimize environmental growing conditions and farming practices.</jats:p>

AB  - Rainbow trout is an important fish species for Peruvian artisanal aquaculture, comprising over 60 % of the total aquaculture production. However, their industry has been highly affected by several bacterial agents such as Yersinia ruckeri. This pathogen is the causative agent of Enteric Redmouth Disease, and causes high mortality in fingerlings and chronic infection in adult rainbow trout. To date, the immune response of rainbow trout against Y. ruckeri has been well studied in laboratory-controlled infection studies (i.e. intraperitoneal infection, bath immersion), however, the immune response during natural infection has not been explored. To address this, in this study, 35 clinically healthy O. mykiss without evidence of lesions or changes in behavior and 32 rainbow trout naturally infected by Y. ruckeri, were collected from semi-intensive fish farms located in the Central Highlands of Peru. To evaluate the effect on the immune response, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and ELISA were conducted using head kidney, spleen, and skin tissues to evaluate the relative gene expression and protein levels. Our results show a significant increase in the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il1b, tnfa, and il6, as well as ifng in all three tissues, as well as increases in IL-1β and IFN-γ protein levels. The endogenous pathway of antigen presentation showed to play a key role in defense against Y. ruckeri, due to the upregulation of mhc-I, tapasin, and b2m transcripts, and the significant increase of Tapasin protein levels in infected rainbow trout. None of the genes associated with the exogenous pathway of antigen presentation showed a significant increase in infected fish, suggesting that this pathway is not involved in the response against this intracellular pathogen. Finally, the transcripts of immunoglobulins IgM and IgT did not show a modulation, nor were the protein levels evaluated in this study.

AB  - Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) is an economically important fish in Asian and Australian markets, but few pharmacokinetic (PK) data of antimicrobial drugs in this species is available. The present study investigated the PK behaviour of florfenicol (FF) through medicated feed in Asian seabass cultured at 25°C. The serum and muscle/skin concentrations of FF and its metabolite florfenicol amine (FFA) were determined by the HPLC-FLD method and analysed by one-compartmental model. The optimal dosages were determined by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) approach and the linear regression analysis was used to determine the withdrawal time (WDT). The PK study following a single oral administration of 15 mg/kg FF via medicated feed revealed that the absorption half-life (t<sub>1/2Ka</sub> ), elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2K</sub> ), peak concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), volume of distribution (Vd/F) and clearance (CL/F) were 1.47 h, 8.07 h, 8.61 μg/ml, 146.41 h·μg/ml, 1.19 L/kg and 0.102 L/kg/h, respectively. The muscle/skin concentration-time profile was similar to that of the serum, suggesting well distribution but only a small fraction of FF was metabolized to FFA. The optimal dosage for a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 μg/ml was calculated as 13.38 mg/kg/day. The appropriate WDT after multiple oral medications with 15 mg/kg FF once daily for 7 days was determined as 8 days. Information obtained from the current study can potentially be applied for the treatment of bacterial diseases in farming Asian seabass.

AB  - <jats:p>Nutritional information of fresh seafood, including salmon, is not commonly available to the public, which can lead to misconceptions. The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional content of salmon fillets, comparing: (1) Canadian salmon, both wild (pink, chinook, and sockeye) and farmed (Atlantic salmon); (2) Canadian farmed Atlantic salmon grown in ocean net pens or land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS); and (3) farmed Atlantic salmon raised in Canada compared with Scotland, Chile, and Ireland. Samples were purchased from retail stores in Canada and analyzed for moisture, crude protein, total lipid, fatty acids, amino acids, cholesterol, mercury, and color. The greatest differences in nutritional content were between species, rather than if it was wild or farmed. Compared to salmon raised in net pens, salmon raised in RAS had three times more eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per serving (0.7/100 g vs. 2.3/100 g, respectively), twice as much omega-3s (14% vs. 30%) and redder in color (24.7 vs. 30.1) but higher in saturated fats (18% vs. 24%). Scottish salmon had over double the amount of EPA + DHA per 100 g (1.6 g) than salmon from Canada (0.70 g), Chile (0.66 g), and Ireland (0.61 g). While nutritional content differed among salmon types, each type can provide dietary essential nutrients that can benefit consumers.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Salmon farming stands out from many other industries with its very high profitability, but it is also highly volatile. The main question is whether the profit of individual firms is stable, or whether profitable firms change from year to year. The purpose of this article is to apply the theory of profit persistence to answer this question for salmon farming in Norway. By using panel data from 2010 to 2019, available from public statistics, we study the relative deviation from the average profits. We estimate the speed of adjustment to the profit norm by using a dynamic GMM estimator. We find a high degree of convergence to the average profit among salmon farmers. For companies belonging to the group with below-average profit, there is a positive correlation between growth and profitability and a negative link between debt ratio and deviation of profit rate. Our finding is that although the Norwegian aquaculture industry has large profits, there is large volatility in the profits of this industry. This is useful knowledge for investors, lenders, public authorities and others who need to know something about the risk in the aquaculture industry.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Seaweed surfaces harbor diverse epibiotic bacterial communities with functions related to morphogenesis, host health, and defense. Among seaweed holobionts, culturable strains can represent innovative sources of bioactive compounds and enzymes. The global industrial demand for microbial enzymes is continually growing in order to improve certain manufacturing processes with new perspectives of industrial exploitation. In this regard, the present study focuses on the enzymatic production and the antimicrobial activities of culturable epibiotic bacteria of <jats:italic>Ulva</jats:italic> from the Tunisian coast. Culturable associated bacteria were isolated and molecular identification was realized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. For each strain, eight enzymatic activities were investigated: amylase, hemolysis, DNase, cellulase, lecithinase, lipase, gelatinase, and chitinase. The antimicrobial activity of <jats:italic>Ulva</jats:italic>-associated bacteria was evaluated against seven pathogenic bacteria, <jats:italic>Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio alginoliticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella typhymurium</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>, and one yeast, <jats:italic>Candida albicans</jats:italic>. The antibiotic resistance of isolated strains was determined for 15 commonly used antibiotics. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates belonged to  Alphaproteobacteria (3), Gammaproteobacteria (5), Actinobacteria (3), and Firmicutes (4) phyllum. The majority of the isolates (66%) produced simultaneously more than one enzyme. Hemolysis was produced by 46.6% of isolates, while DNase was produced by 33% of strains. On the other hand, 13% of strains produced lecithinase, gelatinase, cellulase, and lipase. No chitinase was produced by the isolated bacteria. In addition, 60% of isolates displayed antimicrobial activity against at least one pathogenic strain. All  <jats:italic>Ulva ohnoi</jats:italic>-associated bacteria were resistant to at least seven commonly used antibiotics. These results highlighted the occurrence of several enzymatic activities within <jats:italic>Ulva</jats:italic>-associated bacteria that can have potential uses in the industrial sector.</jats:p>

        <jats:p>Healthy populations of salmonids are integral for the functioning of ecosystems and valuable for the socio-cultural well-being of humans. Past declines were attributed to anthropogenic stressors, raising concern about the sustainability of populations. Accordingly, many salmonids are listed on red lists and protected by national legislation. One region where salmonid populations are threatened is Northern Spain, the most southern distribution of both the Atlantic salmon (protected under the EU Habitat Directive) and the brown trout. Here, we collated ~ 700 biomonitoring samples of both species collected across 177 sites over a 10-year period (2010–2019) to describe ongoing trends in these species and to relate them to site characteristics and potential drivers. We showed that both species have declined substantially, with stocked individuals constituting the majority of both populations. Natural reproduction was almost entirely absent for the brown trout (&lt; 1%), but present in the Atlantic salmon (~ 20%). Both species expressed distinct spatial patterns, likely related to their stocking. As such, the observed trends for both species illustrate that reproduction is almost entirely lacking, underlined by a lack of adult salmonids. As a result, we not only underline alarming conditions of both species, but also question the effectiveness of currently employed stocking. Given that both species are of increasing conservation concern, targeted restoration measures like dam removal and pollution reduction must be applied to generate self-sustaining populations. River basin specific analyses of constraints are required to detect limiting factors on which conservation actions can be taken to ultimately make stocking dispensable.</jats:p>

AB  - With the increase in the human population, the need for protein-rich food is increasing. To cope with the increased demand for fish and fish-related products, aquaculture is shifted towards semi-intensive and intensive culture practices. These cultivation practices exacerbate disease outbreaks. Farmers use extensive antibiotics to manage disease outbreaks and lessen the economic impact due to fish mortality. Inappropriate and extensive use of antibiotics results in the development of resistant strains and the presence of antibiotic residues in fish muscles pose a serious threat to food safety for human consumption. Water and dietary supplements that can be effectively used as alternatives to antibiotics are an active area of research. Prebiotics and synbiotics are promising candidates to replace antibiotics and have been used for the treatment and control of pathogens in tilapia aquaculture. In this chapter, the use of prebiotics and synbiotics as growth promoters and as alternatives to antibiotics in tilapia aquaculture has been addressed, along with their possible mechanism of action. Moreover, the positive effects of pre and synbiotics on tilapia health are also highlighted with emphases on growth, immune modulation, and alteration in gut microflora.

AB  - <jats:p>Urban farming is a sustainable and adaptable farming alternative. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, urban farming is an efficient alternative since it does not require high mobility. This study examined the efficacy of implementing urban farming with the Community’s Economic Impact Analysis (EIA). This type of research is qualitative research with deep interview techniques by the 7 participants. The participants are the people of Kauman Village, Malang City, East Java, Indonesia. The results showed that the impact of urban farming in Kauman significantly increased the community’s Economic Impact Analysis (EIA). The public’s perception of the application of urban farming is quite good. Most people perceive the benefits of implementing urban farming, including using green land around their houses. According to Economic Impact Analysis, implementing urban farming can increase well-being in terms of food security. Community participation in implementing urban farming looks quite effective and enthusiastic so that people, individually and in groups, perceive the benefits of implementing this farming system.</jats:p>

AB  - Secondary metabolites-organic compounds that are often bioactive-produced by endophytes, among others, provide a selective advantage by increasing the organism's survivability. Secondary metabolites mediate the symbiotic relationship between endophytes and their host, potentially providing the host with tolerance to, and protection against biotic and abiotic stressors. Secondary metabolites can be secreted as a dissolved substance or emitted as a volatile. In a previous study, we isolated bioactive endophytes from several macroalgae and tested them in vitro for their ability to inhibit major disease-causing pathogens of aquatic animals in the aquaculture industry. One endophyte (isolate Abp5, <i>K. flava</i>) inhibited and killed, in vitro, the pathogen <i>Saprolegnia parasitica</i>, an oomycete that causes saprolegniasis-a disease affecting a wide range of aquatic animals. Here, using analytical chemistry tools, we found that Abp5 produces the volatile organic compound (VOC) 8-nonenoic acid. Once we confirmed the production of this compound by the endophyte, we tested the compound's ability to treat <i>S. parasitica</i> in in vitro and in vivo bioassays. In the latter, we found that 5 mg/L of the compound improves the survival of larvae challenged with <i>S. parasitica</i> by 54.5%. Our isolation and characterization of the VOC emitted by the endophytic <i>K. flava</i> establish the groundwork for future studies of endophytic biocontrol agents from macroalgae. Use of this compound could enable managing oomycete agricultural pathogens in general, and <i>S. parasitica</i> in particular, a major causal agent in aquaculture diseases.

La incertidumbre que conlleva el sufrimiento ambiental, sumado a la falta de evidencia y las dificultades de levantar información científica acerca de la salud del territorio costero e insular, configura un espacio residual propicio para la baja regulación de las industrias y la profundización de sus afectaciones sobre los territorios y sus habitantes.

AB  - This study explored the combined influence of tank color, stocking density, and gender on Tilapia zillii's performance and well-being. In this 120-day trial, 320 T. zillii, each initially weighing 10.0 ± 0.1 g/fish, were distributed among 24 tanks. The experiment included eight distinct treatment combinations, varying tank color (blue and green), stocking density (10 and 30 fish/m<sup>3</sup>) and sex (monosexual and mixed). The results showed that blue tanks improved specific growth rate and condition factor, while green tanks were better for feed utilization. Density at 30 fish/m<sup>3</sup> showed the highest mean values of final body weight and total length, weight gain (WG), and gain length. Mono-sex outperformed mixed-sex ones in WG and daily growth. Interactions between color, density and sex were significant, affecting growth and feed utilization. Green tanks were best for protein profiles, while blue tanks excelled in glucose. A density of 10 fish/m<sup>3</sup> yielded the highest protein profiles, and mono-sex fish had higher protein profiles. For lipid profiles, green tanks were superior, and density affected lipid profiles. Mixed-sex populations were best for certain lipid profile parameters. Interactions between these factors also played a significant role, making the biochemical profiles of T. zillii a complex interplay of various factors. The results explored that tank color, fish density and sex influence the activity of nonspecific immune enzymes in the liver of T. zillii. Blue tanks and lower fish density led to higher nonspecific immune enzymes, while mono-sex fish exhibited more significant nonspecific immune enzymes. Complex interactions between these factors also influenced nonspecific immune enzyme activities. Blue tanks increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, while green tanks raised glutathione S-transferases (GST) and catalase (CAT) levels. Lower fish density led to higher MDA, while higher density increased GST and CAT. Mono-sex fish had more MDA and GST, while mixed-sex fish showed greater CAT levels. Complex interactions among these factors affected the antioxidant levels in T. zillii. In summary, our study suggests that rearing T. zillii in green tanks at higher densities (30 fish/m<sup>3</sup>) and in mono-sex conditions yields the best results in terms of growth and overall performance.

AB  - Conflict between stakeholder groups around social and environmental issues can fragment communities and disrupt development. For the past decade, salmon farming has globally been one of the most contentious issues within the aquaculture sector. Attempts to mitigate these conflicts have often been counterproductive due to high levels of distrust across stakeholder groups. A lower risk approach is to evaluate strategy options within a virtual socio-ecological system prior to real-world implementation. Using the Tasmanian salmon debate as a case study, this paper describes results from a social influence model that for the first time represents key stakeholder groups. This approach has allowed the responses of different stakeholders and their contribution to overall conflict to be explored and assessed under alternative communication strategies. Reductions in community conflict were achieved through improved marine literacy, collaborative learning amongst key stakeholder groups, and broad dissemination of information relating to industry performance on social and environmental issues. Model results further demonstrate that the perceived legitimacy of such initiatives depends on depoliticising the debate to address issues around regulatory capture. While applied here to salmon aquaculture, the modelling approach and lessons on effective communication strategies are likely to be relevant to a broad range of socio-ecological conflicts.

AB  - Sea louse ectoparasitosis is a major threat to fish aquaculture. Avermectins such as ivermectin and emamectin have been effectively used against sea louse infestation, but the emergence of resistance has limited their use. A better understanding of the molecular targets of avermectins is essential to the development of novel treatment strategies or new, more effective drugs. Avermectins are known to act by inhibiting neurotransmission through allosteric activation of glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls). We have investigated the GluCl subunit present in Caligus rogercresseyi, a sea louse affecting aquaculture in the Southern hemisphere. We identify four new subunits, CrGluCl-B to CrGluCl-E, and characterise them functionally. CrGluCl-A (previously reported as CrGluClα), CrGluCl-B and CrGluCl-C all function as glutamate channel receptors with different sensitivities to the agonist, but in contrast to subunit -A and -C, CrGluCl-B is not activated by ivermectin but is rather antagonised by the drug. CrGluCl-D channel appears active in the absence of any stimulation by glutamate or ivermectin and CrGluCl-E does not exhibit any activity. Notably, the expression of CrGluCl-B with either -A or -C subunits gives rise to receptors unresponsive to ivermectin and showing altered response to glutamate, suggesting that coexpression has led to the preferential formation of heteromers to which the presence of CrGluCl-B confers the property of ivermectin-activation refractoriness. Furthermore, there was evidence for heteromer formation with novel properties only when coexpressing pairs E/C and D/B CrGluCl subtypes. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that three transmembrane domain residues contribute to the lack of activation by ivermectin, most crucially Gln 15' in M2, with mutation Q15'T (the residue present in ivermectin-activated subunits A and C) conferring ivermectin activation to CrGluCl-B. The differential response to avermectin of these Caligus rogercresseyi GluClsubunits, which are highly conserved in the Northern hemisphere sea louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis, could have an influence on the response of these parasites to treatment with macrocyclic lactones. They could serve as molecular markers to assess susceptibility to existing treatments and might be useful molecular targets in the search for novel antiparasitic drugs.

AB  - <jats:p>Aquatic food production holds great promise as a viable solution to tackle the pressing issue of meeting the protein requirements of the African populace. It plays a crucial role in food security and economic growth, especially in tropical Africa. With a fast-expanding population, there is a growing need for aquatic food sources to provide inexpensive protein and essential nutrients. Despite Africa’s vast aquatic food source supplies and the importance of aquatic food in healthy and sustainable diets, several challenges hinder its full exploitation in the tropical African environment. This study, therefore, aims to assess the existing state of aquatic food resources in Africa, examine the nutritional advantages associated with these foods, and identify the problems that hinder their maximal utilization. The findings highlight the differences in aquatic protein consumption across various countries, emphasizing the importance of considering local factors when formulating nutritional interventions and policies. The comparison between the supply of protein from aquatic sources and land animals across African nations revealed a consistent trend of lower availability of aquatic protein. Africa, in particular, had relatively lower <jats:italic>per capita</jats:italic> consumption values of animal protein. The continent’s average quantity of land animal food significantly surpassed the average aquatic food supply. This suggests a predominant reliance on land animal sources in African countries to meet dietary protein needs. This finding holds significant importance for policymakers, nutritionists, and stakeholders, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to improve protein accessibility in African countries. Moreover, it calls for attention to address any existing imbalances between the utilization of land and aquatic protein sources in the region.</jats:p>

AB  - Gut microbiota play a vital role in fish health homeostasis. Antibiotics are known to alter microbial community composition and diversity; however, the substantial effects of antibiotics upon the gut microbiome with respect to immune-related pathways in healthy fish remain unclear. Accordingly, here we explored the impact of two antibiotics on the intestinal health, immune response, microbiome dynamics, and transcriptome profiles of grass carp. A two-week feeding trial was carried out in which the basal diet was complemented with enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg) or florfenicol (10 mg/kg). The results showed that: (1) Enrofloxacin and florfenicol both induced intestinal oxidative stress and reduced the digestive enzyme activity of grass carp. (2) High-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA revealed that enrofloxacin but not the florfenicol treatment influenced gut microbiota diversity in grass carp by shifting α/β-diversity with more abundant pathogens detected. (3) Transcriptome profiling demonstrated that florfenicol down-regulated the immune-related pathways of grass carp, and the network analysis revealed that IgA was negatively correlated with certain pathogens, such as <i>Shewanella</i> and <i>Aeromonas</i>. (4) Antibiotic-induced alternations of gut core microbes were revealed <i>via</i> immune-related transcripts, as were lower mRNA expression levels of mucosal-related genes. (5) Apoptosis and histopathological changes were detected in the enrofloxacin- and florfenicol-treated groups compared with the control group. Overall, administering antibiotics will promote oxidative stress, cause intestinal flora dysbiosis, inhibit the mucosal immune system, and induce apoptosis in grass carp.

AB  - Recent developments in rapid digital phenotyping methods have resulted in new phenotypes in finfish aquaculture like feed intake, growth, and body fat towards improving the feed efficiency complex. Similarly, digital operational welfare indicators have been newly developed for Atlantic salmon including: the number of lice, the number and severity of wounds, condition of fins and smoltification status. The methods employed across these diverse phenotypes vary in approach but show some similarities. In general, they focus on being high throughput and non-invasive, reducing the fish time out of water by using semi-automated image or vibrational spectroscopy. All phenotypes tested were significantly heritable (0.18-0.61) and correlated to their respective gold standards (0.70-0.98). The added benefit of being either higher throughput, cheaper or less invasive than their gold standard counter parts; means digital phenotyping methods will likely continue to develop to meet the needs of future genetic selection programmes.

AB  - <jats:p>Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) have been classified depending on the causative organism and its impacts: non-toxic HAB (microalgae capable of affecting tourism and causing oxygen deficiency, which generates mortality of marine organisms), toxic HAB (microalgae capable of transferring toxins to the food chain), and ichthyotoxic HAB (microalgae capable of generating mechanical damage in fish). HABs represent a worldwide problem and have apparently increased in frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution at different latitudes. This review details the occurrence of HAB events in the Southeast Pacific, Chile, over a 65-year period, analysing two of the three types of HAB described: toxic and ichthyotoxic HABs. For this, we conducted a review from many different scientific sources and from the written press and social media, that have mentioned HAB events in the country. In Chile, the microalgae involved in HAB events are dinoflagellate (52%), diatoms (33%) and silicoflagellate (10%), with a total of 41 species and/or genera described in the literature. A total of 501 HAB events were recorded in Chile between 1956 and 2021, where 240 (47.9%), 238 (47.5%), 14 (2.7%), 8 (1.5%) and 1 (0.2%) event were caused by diatoms, dinoflagellate, silicoflagellate, raphidophycean and haptophyte, respectively. An apparent increase in the frequency of HAB events is observed since the first record in 1956, with a maximum of 46 events during the years 2017 and 2019. The highest incidence in fish is caused by the group of silicoflagellate, raphidophycean and haptophyte (23 events), where 10 events caused mortalities in salmon with an incidence rate of 43.4%. Unlike what is observed with diatoms and dinoflagellate, the events associated with these groups are less frequent, but hold a much higher salmon mortality rate. During the last 65 years, HAB’s geographic extent shows an apparent trend to increase south-to-north. However, the identification of events is closely linked to the areas where much of the country’s aquaculture is located and, therefore, it could be biased. In turn, it is observed that the apparent increase in HAB events could be associated with a greater monitoring effort after major events (e.g., after the 2016 HAB event). On the other hand, it is also recognized a lack of knowledge about harmful algae throughout the Chilean Humboldt Current system, particularly in the northern regions, such as Atacama and Coquimbo. Therefore, the total number of blooms that have occurred in fjords and channels, particularly those that have caused minor economic impacts for artisanal fishermen and the salmon and mussel farming sector, might be underestimated.</jats:p>

TorbjBrn Einar Asgard NUMBER OF PAGES/APPENOICES .. 30 + Appendices This report presents the carbon footprint and area use of Norwegian farmed salmon that is fed five different diets. It also compares the carbon footprint and occupation of agricultural land of Norwegian farmed salmon from 2010 with Swedish pig and chicken. All results are calculated according to LCA methodology where the functional unit is 1 kg edible product and the system boundaries From fishing/growing oFfeed ingredients and until the products are at the farm gate. Results show that changes in the content of marine ingredients can change the final carbon footprint with ± 7 %. Per kilo edible product a salmon that is Fed the average Norwegian feed diet in 201 D has a carbon footprint of 2.6 kg C02e, it occupies 3J m 2 agricultural land and requires 115 m of sea primary production area. Although only liD % of the diet was of marine origin, the area needed to produce those inputs was much larger than the area used for farming. The comparison with pig and chicken concluded that salmon has the lowest carbon footprint and occupies least agricultural land. Even an almost "vegetarian" salmon can occupy less agricultural land than chicken. Pig had the highest carbon Footprint and the highest occupation of agricultural land.

AB  - <jats:p>Marine aquaculture has been expanded into more remote areas due to the increasing demand for high value-added fish products, bringing more challenges in fuel supply and mooring safety to open ocean aquaculture farms. Therefore, the idea of integrating aquaculture farms with offshore renewable energy has attracted tremendous interest. This study proposes a novel open ocean aquaculture ship integrated with a NREL 5 MW wind turbine. In addition, an internal turret mooring system is installed at the bow of the aquaculture ship, making the wind turbine always face the wind blowing direction due to the weathervaning effect. In this study, a preliminary study of the dynamics and wind power generation of the proposed open ocean aquaculture ship was conducted. The aerodynamic and elastic effects of the wind turbine and the effect of nets under the wave and current behavior on the dynamics of the single-point moored aquaculture ship were investigated. Furthermore, the effects of the dynamics of the aquaculture ship on the power generation of the wind turbine were also studied to investigate the feasibility of the idea to integrate an aquaculture ship with a wind turbine.</jats:p>

AB  - Fed aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing and most valuable food production industries in the world. The efficiency with which farmed fish convert feed into biomass influences both environmental impact and economic revenue. Salmonid species, such as king salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), exhibit high levels of plasticity in vital rates such as feed intake and growth rates. Accurate estimations of individual variability in vital rates are important for production management. The use of mean trait values to evaluate feeding and growth performance can mask individual-level differences that potentially contribute to inefficiencies. Here, the authors apply a cohort integral projection model (IPM) framework to investigate individual variation in growth performance of 1625 individually tagged king salmon fed one of three distinct rations of 60%, 80%, and 100% satiation and tracked over a duration of 276 days. To capture the observed sigmoidal growth of individuals, they compared a nonlinear mixed-effects (logistic) model to a linear model used within the IPM framework. Ration significantly influenced several aspects of growth, both at the individual and at the cohort level. Mean final body mass and mean growth rate increased with ration; however, variance in body mass and feed intake also increased significantly over time. Trends in mean body mass and individual body mass variation were captured by both logistic and linear models, suggesting the linear model to be suitable for use in the IPM. The authors also observed that higher rations resulted in a decreasing proportion of individuals reaching the cohort's mean body mass or larger by the end of the experiment. This suggests that, in the present experiment, feeding to satiation did not produce the desired effects of efficient, fast, and uniform growth in juvenile king salmon. Although monitoring individuals through time is challenging in commercial aquaculture settings, recent technological advances combined with an IPM approach could provide new scope for tracking growth performance in experimental and farmed populations. Using the IPM framework might allow the exploration of other size-dependent processes affecting vital rate functions, such as competition and mortality.

AB  - Preventing farmed fish from escaping sea cages is a major challenge for developing sustainable aquaculture practices. In this study, the individual behaviour of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua to inspect and bite the net was investigated in 4 replicate multi-patch experiments, using underwater video techniques and behavioural event recording. The experimental system in - cluded a tank enclosure where cod were presented with 6 separate net panels: duplicate pairs of plain control nets and 2 different treatment panels. Four holes were made in the treatment panels, 3 of which were mended with different repair techniques including short and loose thread ends and contrasting colour repair threads. Behavioural effects of feed stimulants were studied before, during and after a feed source was placed outside the net. The cod inspected and bit the net sys- tematically, significantly focusing on loose threads or minor damage on the net, and the fish were capable of causing severe net damage within a few days. The observed behaviours were related to hunger level and feed stimulation, and increased significantly during times when a feed source was present outside the net wall. Few bites were observed, and almost no measureable damage was recorded to plain control panels and the area around unrepaired holes during the treatment. Repairs made with white and black threads, and loose, long ends were significantly more dam- aged than repairs made with short thread ends and threads of similar colour as the net. The exper- iments demonstrated how a behavioural approach might be used in interpretation of a practical problem in aquaculture, and the results will be useful in the development of technology and escape mitigation strategies.

AB  - The deliberate release of captive-bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridization, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco-genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence of such competitive interactions on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing an influx of foreign/domesticated individuals. The model is applicable to any taxon that experiences natural or human-mediated inputs of locally maladapted genotypes ('intrusion'), in addition to phenotype-dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g. breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, density-dependent regulation limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under-appreciated interactions between phenotype-dependent competitive interactions and maladaptive hybridization, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self-sustaining wild populations.

AB  - Fishery managers and resource conservationists are increasingly interested in understand- ing the fish health and disease risks of free-ranging fishes and whether propagated fishes or features and practices used at fish culture facilities pose a health risk to free-ranging populations. Disease agents are present in most both captive and all free-ranging fish populations, but the consequences and extent of infections in free-ranging populations are often difficult to measure, control, and understand. Sampling methods, protocols, and assay techniques developed to assess the health of captive populations are not as applicable for assessments of free-ranging fishes. The use of chemicals and therapeutics to control diseases and parasites in propagated fishes likely reduces the risk of introducing specific pathogens into the environment, but control measures may have localized effects on the environment surrounding fish culture facilities. To understand health risks of propa- gated and free ranging fishes, we must consider fish populations, culture facilities, fish releases, and their interactions within the greater geospatial features of the aquatic environment.

AB  - To maintain the health of aquaculture fish, it is critical to understand the composition of microorganisms in aquaculture water and sediment and the factors affecting them. This study examined the water and sediment microbiota compositions of four different types of ponds in South China that were used to culture grass carp (<i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>) of different sizes through high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and analyzed their correlations with environmental factors. The results showed that ponds with cultured grass carp of different sizes exhibited significant differences in terms of water physicochemical properties and composition of water and sediment microbiota. Furthermore, the exchange of microorganisms between water and sediment microbiota was lowest in ponds with the smallest grass carp and highest in ponds with the largest grass carp. All detected environmental factors except water temperature were significantly correlated with the water microbiota, and all detected environmental factors in the sediment were correlated with sediment microbiota. Moreover, <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> and <i>Vibrio</i> were significantly increased in the water microbiota, especially in ponds with small juvenile grass carp, implying an increased risk of <i>A. hydrophila</i> and <i>Vibrio</i> infections in these environments. Our results provide useful information for the management of grass carp aquaculture ponds.

AB  - Consumers prefer ecolabeled products. However, little is known about the effects of ecolabels when consumers are simultaneously exposed to negative environmental information. We conducted a stated choice experiment in France with eight fish products that were either ecolabeled or unlabeled. Four types of negative information concerning the potential negative environmental consequences of catching wild fish or producing farmed fish were randomly administered to the participants. The data were analyzed by a mixed logit model. Several results emerged. First, there are positive ecolabeling effects on the willingness to pay (WTP) for fish. Second, ecolabeling cannot fully mitigate the negative effects on WTP of negative environmental information. Third, there is a positive effect on the WTP for substitute fish produced with the same production technology as the type of fish that receives negative environmental information.

AB  - Marine aquaculture has the potential to increase its contribution to the global food system and provide valuable ecosystem services, but appropriate planning, licensing and regulation systems must be in place to enable sustainable development. At present, approaches vary considerably throughout the world, and several national and regional investigations have highlighted the need for reforms if marine aquaculture is to fulfil its potential. This article aims to map and evaluate the challenges of planning and licensing for growth of sustainable marine aquaculture. Despite the range of species, production systems and circumstances, this study found a number of common themes in the literature; complicated and fragmented approaches to planning and licensing, property rights and the licence to operate, competition for space and marine spatial planning, emerging species and diversifying marine aquaculture production (seaweed production, Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture [IMTA], nutrient and carbon offsetting with aquaculture, offshore aquaculture and co-location and multiuse platforms), and the need to address knowledge gaps and use of decision-support tools. Planning and licensing can be highly complicated, so the UK is used as a case study to show more detailed examples that highlight the range of challenges and uncertainty that industry, regulators and policymakers face across interacting jurisdictions. There are many complexities, but this study shows that many countries have undergone, or are undergoing, similar challenges, suggesting that lessons can be learned by sharing knowledge and experiences, even across different species and production systems, rather than having a more insular focus.

AB  - <jats:p>The manuscript endeavors to provide a perspective on the role of water bodies in the spread of antimicrobial (antibiotic) resistance (AMR), antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB), and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) among pathogens, animals, and humans. We briefly indicate how the AMR problem is globally affecting public health, along with strategies and mechanisms to combat the dissemination of ARB and ARGs. A brief systematic survey of the literature (2015-onwards) for the presence of antimicrobial residues and the occurrence of ARGs and antimicrobial resistant microorganisms in different water bodies/sources indicates the gravity of the situation and suggests their important role in the occurrence and spread of AMR, ARB, and ARGs. The prevalent water treatment methods which tend to reduce ARB and ARGs from water resources are unable to remove them completely, allowing the problem of AMR to continue and spread to organisms of concern. In this opinion article, we attempt to underline the key role of controlling the release/discharge of antimicrobial contaminants in water bodies and their buildup in checking the development and spread of AMR. The reduction in the release of antibiotic residues in the environment, especially water bodies, combined with the development of improved surveillance means and efficacious treatment/removal/decomposition methods could help curb the menace of AMR effectively. We suggest the expansion of the ambit of ‘One Health Approach to AMR crises proposed by the World Bank, 2021 to include the ‘reduction of antimicrobial contamination of the environment’ as the ‘seventh domain’ of activity to effectively achieve its objective.</jats:p>

AB  - Feed efficiency is a highly desirable breeding goal trait as it can potentially reduce the relative economic cost of feed and concurrently reduce the environmental footprint of fish production. However, recording feed intake is a bottleneck in Atlantic salmon production. We recorded feed intake in 700 Atlantic salmon parr from 34 full sibling families using the X-ray method, where fish were fed feed containing radio-opaque beads and subsequently X-ray imaged one time after a full meal corresponding to the daily ration. In parallel, we cultured siblings from the same 35 families in duplicate family tanks of 25 individuals per tank and recorded the daily feed intake of each family at the tank level, which is known as the gold standard tank-based method. The heritability estimate for daily feed intake in Atlantic salmon using the X-ray method was significantly different from zero (0.19 ± 0.06) and was genetically correlated to growth-related traits (rg = 0.48–0.81). Daily feed intake at the family level with the X-ray method was highly genetically correlated to the daily feed intake traits using the tank-based feeding method at 0.78–0.82, depending on whether the comparison was made at a common time, common weight, or cumulative feed intake for the entire period. Whilst the X-ray method holds promise for research on the genetic background of feed intake and feed efficiency, more studies are needed to investigate the feasibility during the sea phase of Atlantic salmon production.

AB  - Modern wild-capture marine fisheries are underpinned by energy derived from fossil
fuels. This energy is required for vessel propulsion and gear operation, onboard
processing, freezing and refrigeration, and producing electricity for ancillary services.
Fuel use is the primary driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from marine
fisheries, and the second highest cost to fishers globally after labour. Fuel
consumption has received increased attention from industry, consumers, governments,
and environmental organizations in response to higher and more unpredictable energy
prices and the need to reduce GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. A large and
growing amount of research has been undertaken since the beginning of the 21st
century to measure, characterize, and reduce energy use and GHG emissions in
fishing fleets. This thesis provides an overview of the magnitude of fuel consumption
in marine wild-capture fisheries, assesses how and why fuel consumption and GHG
emissions vary between vessels, fleets, and national industries, and discusses the
environmental and economic implications of energy use in fisheries at global,
regional, and local scales.
The global-scale research here involved the synthesis and analysis of data pertaining
to fuel use in fisheries. Data from all available primary and secondary sources were
compiled in a global fisheries and energy use database (FEUD). Observed rates of
fuel inputs to global fisheries were characterized by target species, primary gear type,
and region. Fuel use rates were then used as a proxy to estimate GHG emissions from
national and global fishing fleets, assess the relative emissions from different sectors
of the global fishing fleet, and track emissions from the industry from 1990 to 2011.
World fisheries in 2011 consumed 40 billion litres of fuel and emitted 168 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHGs to the atmosphere. Energy performance
varied between fisheries by three orders of magnitude, with crustacean fisheries
consuming vastly more fuel than fisheries targeting small pelagic forage fish.
Regional-scale research applied cost and revenue data to estimate the fuel use
intensity (FUI) of a range of Australian fisheries and compare environmental
(emissions) and economic (costs) roles of fuel use. Australian fisheries followed
similar patterns to global fisheries, with all of the more fuel-intensive fisheries
targeting rock lobsters and prawns, while the more efficient fisheries targeted small
pelagics. The economic role of fuel also varied markedly, although fuel costs as a
percentage of fishing revenue did not consistently correlate with consumption rates.
Fuel expenditures in Australian fisheries ranged from 2% of revenue in abalone
fisheries to almost 50% in some prawn fisheries, reflecting not only consumption but
also product value. Importantly, some Australian fisheries were identified as having
reduced their FUI in recent years: in particular, the Northern Prawn Fishery
experienced dramatic improvement in energy performance following substantial
management changes including a rapid reduction in number of fishing vessels.
Local-scale research surveyed rock lobster fishers in several locations in Australia and
New Zealand to quantify energy performance of different sectors of a single fishing
industry (targeting similar species with similar gear and producing similar products),
and to determine the relative role of technological, behavioural, and managerial
factors in driving fuel use. Average weighted FUI of rock lobster fisheries was 1,890
L/t. Interregional comparisons showed that fuel consumption was lowest in Western
Australia and New Zealand, where catch per unit effort (CPUE) was highest. The
drivers of fuel use varied between single day and multiday trips—managementrelated
factors, particularly CPUE, were more influential in single day trips, while
technological variables played a larger role in multiday trips.
This thesis demonstrates that fisheries vary markedly in fuel use and GHG emissions.
Globally and regionally, fuel use largely reflects the species being targeted and the
gear being used. Within fisheries, fuel use is influenced by a range of factors, and the
relative effect of these factors varies between fishery. It is therefore difficult to
generalize across the entire industry when assessing the economic and environmental
performance of fisheries and their products in relation to energy use and GHG
emissions. Many fisheries can produce low-carbon, climate-friendly sources of animal
protein and should be promoted as such, while others are as intensive as high-impact
ruminant production. Importantly, more efficient fisheries are not necessarily more
resilient to fuel costs, and the economic impacts on these fisheries needs to be
considered when discussing subsidies and carbon-pricing policies.
The measurement and characterization of fuel use contributes to our understanding of
both the environmental sustainability of fisheries and the economic resilience of
fisheries to rising and volatile energy prices and carbon-related policies. Energy
resource use and climate change will be defining challenges of the 21st century, and
the measurement, characterization, and improvement of energy performance in
fishing fleets is required to ensure the socio-economic resilience and environmental
sustainability of the industry. Incorporation of these issues into fisheries management
and assessments can benefit the industry in the long-term, and help provide a growing
global population with affordable, sustainable products from the ocean.

AB  - <jats:p>Monitoring the first seaward migration of juvenile salmonids, known as smolts, is challenging because there is limited tracking technology suited to their small size. Nevertheless, for their management and conservation purpose, it is critical to understand this phase of their life cycle when they adapt to increased salinity, novel predators and new prey. Smolts of 2 species, Atlantic salmon <jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic> and brown trout <jats:italic>Salmo trutta</jats:italic>, were acoustically monitored at 4 study sites, together with biotic and abiotic parameters, to estimate and explain their survival during their estuarine migration to sea. The 2 species exhibited different levels of survival during this seaward migration, with a higher survival for trout smolts. For both species, survival was similar among 3 of the 4 sites. Migration speed and migratory distance influenced smolt estuarine survival, but body length, body condition, sex, age, and environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen) did not. Migration speed, potentially reflecting smolts’ capacity to avoid predators or escape dangerous areas, had a positive effect on their survival. Increased distance negatively influenced estuarine survival, which could lead to lower survival rate in the River Frome Estuary where orientation is more difficult for smolts due to widely separated environmental cues. Overall, smolt survival through estuaries was estimated between 51 and 97% among 4 populations, suggesting that estuaries are variably challenging environments for migrating smolts, accounting for non-negligible early marine survival. Understanding which estuaries have low survival and why is imperative to prioritise management actions.</jats:p>

AB  - Temperature fluctuations occurring during the cold chain logistics of salmon contribute to lipid oxidation. This study aimed to simulate cold chain interruption through freeze-thaw operations and evaluate the lipidomics data from salmon samples subjected to different numbers of freeze-thaw cycles by using rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) combined with an intelligent surgical knife (iKnife). The results indicated significant differences in the relative abundance of characteristic ions among the samples (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A total of 34 ions with variable importance for the projection values ≥1 were identified as potential biomarkers, including <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 719.4233 ([PC<sub>C36:5</sub>-NH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup>), <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 337.3134 ([FA<sub>C22:1</sub>]<sup>-</sup>), <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 720.4666 ([PE<sub>C35:6</sub>-H]<sup>-</sup>), <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 309.2780 ([FA<sub>C20:1</sub>]<sup>-</sup>), <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 777.4985 ([PC<sub>C40:4</sub>-NH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup>), <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 745.4421 ([PC<sub>C38:6</sub>-NH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup>/[PE<sub>C38:6</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup>), <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 747.4665 ([PC<sub>C38:5</sub>-NH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup>/[PE<sub>C38:5</sub>-NH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>-</sup>), etc. The degree of lipid oxidation was found to be associated with the number of freeze-thaw cycles, exhibiting the most significant alterations in the relative abundance of lipid ions in the 8T samples. Additionally, sensory evaluation by the CIE-<i>L</i>*<i>a</i>*<i>b</i>* method and volatile analysis by headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated significant differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in color and odor among the salmon samples, with a correlation to the number of freeze-thaw cycles. The primary compounds responsible for alterations in salmon odor were aldehydes with lower odor thresholds. In summary, the iKnife-REIMS method accurately differentiated salmon muscle tissues based on varying levels of lipid oxidation, thus expanding the application of REIMS.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">To maintain the quality of frozen Atlantic salmon after thawing and highlight the potential for moving from air fright to boat for long-distance export, a study was designed to investigate the effects of sub-chilling before rapid freezing on the quality of thawed fillets. Atlantic salmon chilled on wet ice before filleting and freezing was used as a control for the experimental factor chilling, whereas fresh fillets were used for the frozen-thawed samples.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The pre-freezing chilling method interacted with the storage protocol and significantly affected the product. For fresh stored fillets, sub-chilling improved the microbiological and textural stability and degradation of proteins. After 1 month of frozen storage, sub-chilled fillets gave better color and textural properties, less adenosine triphosphate degradation and protein denaturation. In addition, sub-chilled 4-month-frozen fillets also showed improved microbial stability compared to those initially chilled with ice before frozen storage. Quality was lost as a function of storage. Fresh fillets generally had higher bacterial counts, surface breaking force, firmness, hue and contents of inosine monophosphate, and lower drip loss and inosine (HxR) levels than those stored frozen-thawed. Moreover, 4-month-frozen fillets had higher HxR levels and lower psychrotrophic viable count growth than those that were frozen for 1 month. The time fillets were stored frozen did not profoundly affect their quality.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">It is concluded that a frozen product might be competitive with a fresh product when sub-chilling is performed before freezing, especially when including the environmental benefits of frozen export by boat rather than air freight. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In this work, Fe2O3-Ni, Fe2O3-Ni-Pd, MgO-Ni, and MgO-Ni-Pd nanoparticles were synthesized, characterized, and used for the degradation of florfenicol (FLO). The main goals were to compare the removal capacity of Fe2O3-Ni and MgO-Ni nanocatalysts and evaluate the effect of Pd incorporation on Fe2O3-Ni and MgO-Ni nanoparticles on the degradation of FLO by heterogeneous Fenton(-like) and photo-Fenton(-like) processes. The adsorption and degradation processes of FLO were assessed, determining that the latter process is the principal mechanism for FLO degradation. Through the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process, the antibiotic was 78 and 44% removed using the Fe2O3-Ni and MgO-Ni nanocatalyst, respectively, improving degradation by 22% when Pd is incorporated into both nanostructures. FLO degradation occurs because of the generation of hydroxyl and superoxide radical and holes in the interface and the Fenton reaction with Fe and Mg present in the nanoparticles. Finally, the main organic intermediates produced during the degradation were identified, allowing the proposal of a degradation pathway. Thus, heterogeneous Fenton(-like) and photo-Fenton(-like) processes using nanoparticles as solid phase catalysts are an excellent alternative to FLO degradation from water, especially considering the easy recovery of the nanoparticles through a simple separation process such as filtration.

AB  - Both the American lobster fishery and salmon aquaculture are important to the economy of Atlantic Canada. Where these industries operate in proximity, research is needed to better understand any interactions and their possible effects. This study explored the effects of azamethiphos on survival and development of larval American lobsters, Homarus americanus, using exposures that reflect concentrations and durations of azamethiphos (anti-sea lice therapeutant used in salmon aquaculture) that can be found in the environment following treatment. In adult trials, we recorded the survival and behaviour of individuals consecutively exposed to short pulses of low concentrations of azamethiphos for a period of 1 to 4 days. Larvae from all stages (I-IV) exhibited an immobilization response when exposed to azamethiphos and that the concentration of azamethiphos that results in a 50% increase in immobilization decreases at increasing exposure time and was as low as 2.9 μgL−1 for a 3 h exposure. After exposure, we registered mortality occurring within 5 days and during the moulting window. In the larval trials the concentration required to reduce the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by 50% increased from stages I to III. In the trials conducted with adults, we observed no mortality over 21 days, but did record an increase in aggressive behaviour with an increasing number of exposures. The temporal overlap between the release of larval lobster stages and the use of azamethiphos is important to consider when assessing potential risk.

AB  - <jats:p>The analysis of offshore fishing capacity is of great significance and practical value to the sustainable utilization and conservation of marine fishery resources. Based on the 2004–2020 China Fishery Statistical Yearbook, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was applied for measuring fishing capacity using a number of fishing vessels, total power, total tonnage, and the number of professional fishermen as the input measures and the annual catch as the output measure. Capacity utilization had a calculated range from 80.7 to 100%, and its average is 93.5%. In the first four years of 2003–2007, the excess investment rate of fishing vessels, total tonnage, total power, and fishermen was low (&lt;5%). There was a consistent sharp upward trend in 2007, a gradual downward trend from 2007 to 2015, and an upward trend after reaching a low point in 2015, with the highest gross tonnage of fishing vessels reaching 25.5%. Four regression models that incorporate machine learning algorithms are used, including Lasso, Ridge, KNN, and Polynomial Features. The goodness of fit for the four models was used as the evaluation index, and the offshore annual catch based on the evaluation index was proposed. The forecasting annual catch of the polynomial model can reach 0.98. Furthermore, a comparative simulation of the DEA incorporating the polynomial model was carried out. The results show that DEA can evaluate input factors under the conditions of a given range, and the polynomial model has more advantages in forecasting annual catches. Furthermore, the combined application of DEA and polynomial model was used to analyze and discuss the management policies of China’s offshore fishery, which can provide help and reference for future management.</jats:p>

AB  - Animal welfare assessments have struggled to investigate the emotional states of animals while focusing solely on available empirical evidence. Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA) may provide insights into an animal's subjective experiences without compromising scientific rigor. Rather than assessing explicit, physical behaviours (i.e., what animals are doing, such as swimming or feeding), QBA describes and quantifies the overall expressive manner in which animals execute those behaviours (i.e., how relaxed or agitated they appear). While QBA has been successfully applied to scientific welfare assessments in a variety of species, its application within aquaculture remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to assess QBA's effectiveness in capturing changes in the emotional behaviour of Atlantic salmon following exposure to a stressful challenge. Nine tanks of juvenile Atlantic salmon were video-recorded every morning for 15 min over a 7-day period, in the middle of which a stressful challenge (intrusive sampling) was conducted on the salmon. The resultant 1-min, 63 video clips were then semi-randomised to avoid predictability and treatment bias for QBA scorers. Twelve salmon-industry professionals generated a list of 16 qualitative descriptors (e.g., relaxed, agitated, stressed) after viewing unrelated video-recordings depicting varying expressive characteristics of salmon in different contexts. A different group of 5 observers, with varied experience of salmon farming, subsequently scored the 16 descriptors for each clip using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Principal Components Analysis (correlation matrix, no rotation) was used to identify perceived patterns of expressive characteristics across the video-clips, which revealed 4 dimensions explaining 74.5% of the variation between clips. PC1, ranging from 'relaxed/content/positive active' to 'unsettled/stressed/spooked/skittish' explained the highest percentage of variation (37%). QBA scores for video-clips on PC1, PC2, and PC4 achieved good inter- and intra-observer reliability. Linear Mixed Effects Models, controlled for observer variation in PC1 scores, showed a significant difference between PC1 scores before and after sampling (<i>p</i> = 0.03), with salmon being perceived as more stressed afterwards. PC1 scores also correlated positively with darting behaviours (<i>r</i> = 0.42, <i>p</i> < 0.001). These results are the first to report QBA's sensitivity to changes in expressive characteristics of salmon following a putatively stressful challenge, demonstrating QBA's potential as a welfare indicator within aquaculture.

               <jats:p>Marine aquaculture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a relatively new industry where breeding programs have led to rapid genetic change in the captive populations that were built up alongside conspecific wild individuals. Throughout its 50-years history, marine aquaculture of Atlantic salmon has been associated with escapes, and studies have shown that escapees may enter rivers, spawn successfully, and this may lead to farmed-to-wild genetic introgression and maladaptation in wild populations. Yet, an open question is what factors can best explain the variability in the proportion of farmed escapees in wild populations, and when present, which additional factors lead to introgression. Here, we combine two large-scale data sets from monitoring escaped farmed salmon and introgression in Norwegian rivers between 2006 and 2018 to model how anthropogenic, environmental, and population factors influence proportion of escapees and level of introgression. We found that increasing farming intensity and river discharge increase the expected proportions of escaped farmed salmon in rivers, whereas a larger wild salmon population size reduces the expected proportion of escapees despite increasing the expected absolute numbers of escaped farmed salmon. On a large scale, introgression is primarily a function of proportions of escaped farmed salmon, and only to a minor extent a function of local environmental factors or salmon population characteristics. This suggests that as long as salmon aquaculture is based on technologies where non-sterile fish can escape, all anadromous wild Atlantic salmon populations are at risk. Large marine protected areas without salmon aquaculture may slow down the rate of intrusion and introgression by increasing the distance between intensive aquaculture and wild populations.</jats:p>

AB  - A growing awareness of the difference between the supply and demand for fish products is fueling rapid growth of an aquaculture industry in Canada, including a freshwater sector, based mainly on the cage farming of rainbow trout. Cage farms can release relatively large loads of organic matter and nutrients to the environment. In consequence, federal and provincial resource management agencies need to develop regulatory instruments that will foster the growth of the industry while ensuring minimal water quality impacts. Such instruments should be science based, but there are currently key gaps in our understanding of the water quality implications of the operations of freshwater cage aquaculture. Here I review the state of science of the water quality implications of cage aquaculture and identify 11 knowledge gaps that currently hamper the development of sound, science-based cage culture management instruments. Perhaps the most important finding of the review is the recognition that, while aquaculture has produced significant increases in lakewater total phosphorus (TP) levels in some situations, classic phosphorus mass balance models may substantially overestimate the contributions of cage farms to TP concentrations in some lakes. Research on this, and perhaps the other knowledge gaps identified in this review, should aid the development of sound management instruments for freshwater cage aquaculture in Canada and elsewhere.

AB  - <jats:p>Mariculture areas are an important non-renewable natural resource and continuously improving their efficiency is important for increasing mariculture output and adjusting its structure. The aim of this study was to measure the mariculture area production efficiency (MAPE) considering undesirable outputs, further analyze its spatiotemporal disparities, and analyze the reasons for the differences observed during the period from 2008 to 2019. The super-efficiency Engel–Blackwell–Miniard (S-EBM) model and global Malmquist–Luenberger (GML) index was selected to analyze the technical efficiency and productivity of MAPE from both the static and dynamic aspects, and the Theil index was used to decompose the regional differences. The results showed that the MAPE showed fluctuation and an increasing trend overall; the production efficiency and technical progress showed a fluctuating rising trend, and technical progress had a significant driving effect on the production efficiency; and intra-regional differences were the main factors that cause the differences in MAPE. The findings suggest the increase of scientific and technological investment in mariculture, changes in mariculture methods, the establishment of environmental monitoring centers in mariculture areas, and the sharing of information technology between regions to achieve sustainable development.</jats:p>

AB  - The effects of nutrient effluents from fish cage aquaculture are an important eutrophication concern. It has been proposed that marine fish farm derived nutrients have the potential to increase phytoplankton abundance and lead to intensification of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and that these blooms may negatively impact both the finfish and the shellfish industry. This study addressed this hypothesis using farmed salmon biomass in Scottish marine waters (as a proxy for nutrient load added to the water column as a consequence of fish farming) cell abundance of HAB taxa that most frequently impact shellfish farms and human health in the region (Dinophysis spp., Alexandrium spp. and Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), and cell abundance of one phytoplankton species of particular concern to the salmon farming industry (Karenia mikimotoi). Data from a 15-year weekly HAB monitoring programme and parallel national monitoring data relating to salmon farm stocking biomass were summarised in 5 km per 5 km aggregation boxes. Linear regression models were used to assess (i) inter-annual variation in cell abundance and total annual farmed salmon biomass; (ii) intra-annual (monthly) variation in harmful phytoplankton cell abundance and salmon biomass; (iii) a further analysis included seasonal effects within the intra-annual analysis. Farmed salmon biomass alone had a non-significant effect on cell abundance of any of the studied phytoplankton taxa. In contrast, a significant effect on cell abundance was found when using location, month or season as the predictive variable. Despite the non-significant impact of fish biomass on phytoplankton counts, the relationship varied seasonally, with a different response of Dinophysis spp. indicating a taxa specific interaction. A possible explanation for the lack of a significant relationship between farmed salmon and harmful phytoplankton cell abundance is that aquaculture farms are generally located in hydrodynamically energetic locations where recurrent flushing likely allows efficient dilution of nutrients. Overall, the analyses suggest that current levels of salmon farming activities do not markedly impact the abundance of routinely monitored biotoxin producing or fish killing phytoplankton taxa in Scottish waters.

               <jats:p>Salmon lice can impact the marine behaviour, growth, and survival of salmonids, but little is known about their effects on Arctic char. We present behavioural responses from the first dose-response experiment with wild anadromous Arctic char (n = 50) infested in situ with salmon lice (0.0–1.2 lice g−1 fish) in an area with low natural infestations. Infested fish spent less time at sea (mean ± SD = 22 ± 6 d) than non-infested fish (mean ±SD = 33 ± 5 d), and a significant dose response was evident, with even very low louse burdens (&amp;lt;0.05 lice g−1 fish) reducing the marine feeding time. Furthermore, a negative correlation was present between time spent close to their native watercourse and parasite burden, suggesting that salmon lice influence the marine habitat use of Arctic char. No impact of salmon lice was evident on the return probability, i.e. marine survival. However, the presence of louse-induced mortality cannot be excluded as the modest sample size was only sufficient to detect extreme effects. Reduced marine feeding time and altered marine habitat use will likely have substantial negative effects on growth and fitness, suggesting that impacts of salmon lice must be considered in the conservation of anadromous Arctic char.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Amidst a global food crisis, securing sustainable food sources is vital. Bivalves such as Naked Clams, historically known as shipworms, offer a promising solution due to their low environmental impact, high nutritional value, and rapid growth rates. Contrary to their image as pests, Naked Clams are the fastest growing bivalves and have various health benefits. Believed to be the world's first aquaculture species, cultivated by Aboriginal Australians 8000 years ago, they are a delicacy in Southeast Asia. Public perception of Naked Clams remains largely unexplored, hindered by their association as pests and worm‐like appearance. This study assesses the perception of Naked Clams through social media, analyzing 40 posts across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, with millions of views and likes. Analysis of nearly 8000 comments revealed that public perception was split, though generally more positive than negative. Concerns included appearance, potential religious dietary conflicts, and the risk of parasites, which can be addressed with educational campaigns. Importantly, 84% of commenters who tried Naked Clams reported liking them. Naked Clams are noted for their high protein content, nutrient density, and health benefits, and are enjoyed in diverse culinary forms, from traditional raw dishes, to battered calamari‐style street foods, to innovative recipes like Naked Clam ice cream. This study highlights the untapped potential of Naked Clams in global diets and calls for further exploration into moving Naked Clams from “gross to gourmet.”</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p> Recent decades have seen an increased appreciation for the role infectious diseases can play in mass mortality events across a diversity of marine taxa. At the same time many Pacific salmon populations have declined in abundance as a result of reduced marine survival. However, few studies have explicitly considered the potential role pathogens could play in these declines. Using a multi-year dataset spanning 59 pathogen taxa in Chinook and Coho salmon sampled along the British Columbia coast, we carried out an exploratory analysis to quantify evidence for associations between pathogen prevalence and cohort survival and between pathogen load and body condition. While a variety of pathogens had moderate to strong negative correlations with body condition or survival for one host species in one season, we found that Tenacibaculum maritimum and Piscine orthoreovirus had consistently negative associations with body condition in both host species and seasons and were negatively associated with survival for Chinook salmon collected in the fall and winter. Our analyses, which offer the most comprehensive examination of associations between pathogen prevalence and Pacific salmon survival to date, suggest that pathogens in Pacific salmon warrant further attention, especially those whose distribution and abundance may be influenced by anthropogenic stressors. </jats:p>

AB  - Mariculture products are generally deemed to have less negative environmental externalities and more nutrient content, and are therefore a promising food substitute for land-based protein products (LPPs). China is the world's largest mariculture producer, with 66% of global production share in 2018. However, different categories of mariculture products have varied nutrient composition and environmental impacts, and ignoring such heterogeneity potentially misleads policy decision making in mariculture development in China. Here, we compare the environmental and nutritional performance of 28 mariculture products with 7 LPPs produced in China. Our results show that although mariculture products are more environmentally friendly than LPPs on the whole, not all mariculture products have better nutrition-environmental performance than LPPs. Only 17 out of 28 mariculture products, mainly shellfish and fish, are found to be both nutritionally and environmentally more friendly than LPPs. Shellfish are promising substitutes for LPPs due to their minor environmental impact, higher nutrient density, greater production volume and lower average price compared with other mariculture products. However, upper dietary limits on daily intake of shellfish due to potential overconsumption of certain micronutrients must also be considered. We also found mariculture derived fish have no distinct environmental, nutritional or cost benefits over some LPPs, such as egg and chicken. The current structure of the mariculture industry in China may be optimized by expanding the production of nutrient-rich mariculture products with low environmental impact and affordable price.

AB  - The management of bacterial pathogens remains a key challenge of aquaculture. The marine gammaproteobacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis is the etiological agent of piscirickettsiosis and causes multi-systemic infections in different salmon species, resulting in considerable mortality and substantial commercial losses. Here, we elucidate its global diversity, evolution, and selection during human interventions. Our comprehensive analysis of 73 closed, high quality genome sequences covered strains from major outbreaks and was supplemented by an analysis of all P. salmonis 16S rRNA gene sequences and metagenomic reads available in public databases. Genome comparison showed that Piscirickettsia comprises at least three distinct, genetically isolated species of which two showed evidence for continuing speciation. However, at least twice the number of species exist in marine fish or seawater. A hallmark of Piscirickettsia diversification is the unprecedented amount and diversity of transposases which are particularly active in subgroups undergoing rapid speciation and are key to the acquisition of novel genes and to pseudogenization. Several group-specific genes are involved in surface antigen synthesis and may explain the differences in virulence between strains. However, the frequent failure of antibiotic treatment of piscirickettsiosis outbreaks cannot be explained by horizontal acquisition of resistance genes which so far occurred only very rarely. Besides revealing a dynamic diversification of an important pathogen, our study also provides the data for improving its surveillance, predicting the emergence of novel lineages, and adapting aquaculture management, and thereby contributes towards the sustainability of salmon farming.

AB  - <jats:p>The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of krill meal (KM) inclusion at various levels (0%, 2.5%, 5%) in plant-based and animal-based feeds, that were fishmeal (FM) and fish oil (FO) free, on Atlantic salmon growth. A FM/FO feed containing 0% KM was the control. Using a 2 × 3 factorial approach, diets were randomly assigned to one of 28 0.5 m3 flow-through tanks (n = 4 tanks per diet) initially stocked with 60 fish (148.4 ± 12.9 g; 23.6 ± 0.8 cm; condition factor (K) = 1.16 ± 0.08) each. Salmon were fed for 90 days using automatic feeders ad libitum. On day 45, stocking densities were reduced to 45 fish per tank by the random removal of 15 individuals to remove any potential of density affecting growth through the trial end. Water temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, and salinity throughout the trial were 11.8 °C, 103.5%, 7.38, and 32.0 g L−1, respectively. Fish fed plant-based feed without KM were lighter (p &lt; 0.05) than all other groups at day 45 and 90, but those fed a plant-based feed with KM had comparable growth and feed intake compared to that of fish fed the control diet. Irrespective of the presence of KM, animal-based feeds achieved comparable weight growth (p &gt; 0.05) to the control and 5% KM plant-based groups, with KM increasing feed intake (p &lt; 0.05). Between day 45 and 90, feed conversion ratios increased in all groups except the control and 0% KM plant-based group, while specific growth rates (SGRs) decreased for all except the 0% KM plant-based diet. Between-group differences (p &lt; 0.05) were also noted for the thermal growth coefficient. No differences were recorded in visceral or intestinal weight, and whole-body lipid levels were identical, proportional for all groups. Although differences (p &lt; 0.05) were apparent in the concentrations of individual fillet fatty acids between groups, a 75 g serving size of any treatment would be sufficient to exceed daily intake recommendations for EPA + DHA. This trial determined that benefit, in terms of feed intake and growth performance, was gained when KM was added to plant-based feeds. However, no such advantage was observed when KM was used with animal-based feeds.</jats:p>
