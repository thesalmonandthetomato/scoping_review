AB  - The ecology of infectious diseases in wild and managed salmon populations is reviewed. Few pathogens have caused significant disease epidemics in the wild, and although parasites of returning adults are best documented, diseases among parr (e.g., Gyrodactylus salaris) are probably most important. The greatest diversity of parasites is known from the marine phase but few are likely to be significant pathogens, although conclusive evidence is lacking because diseased salmon cannot be tracked. The importance of stress as an immunosuppressant of fishes in degraded habitats is discussed. In addition, releases and restocking have probably also reduced the genetic disease resistance of wild fishes. We note that myxozoans, furunculosis, G. salaris, and sea lice are the pathogens most likely to threaten wild and managed salmon stocks in future. Despite abundant research on pathogens of farmed salmon, little is known of their impact on wild or managed stocks and an adequate theoretical framework for salmon disease ...

AB  - The outbreak, persistence, and eradication of infectious diseases often depend on the density of hosts. In coastal seas, many fisheries are fully or over-exploited; meanwhile, farmed popu- lations are increasing rapidly with aquaculture growth. Marine aquaculture facilities are typically open to the surrounding ecosystem and, therefore, wild and farmed populations are connected by their shared parasites. At the core of epidemiological theory are host density thresholds, above which diseases can persist or invade and below which diseases can be eradicated. Host density thresholds in aquaculture-fishery interactions likely function at regional scales that encompass multiple farms, which are connected by pathogen dispersal and the movement of wild hosts. Sudden outbreaks of parasitic copepods in wild-farmed salmon systems may be linked to aquaculture growth exceeding host density thresholds. Abiotic (e.g. temperature and salinity), management (e.g. husbandry and farm siting), and biotic factors (e.g. migrations of wild hosts) likely affect threshold values. A con- nected wild-farmed host population can exceed a host density threshold due to an influx of wild hosts via migration, increases in aquaculture production, or environmental change such as climate warm- ing. Coastal management and policy should heed the disease implications of climate warming, aqua- culture growth, and fisheries restoration that suggest increasing host densities and decreasing threshold values.

AB  - Artificial propagation programs focused on production, such as commercial aquaculture or forestry, entail strong domestication selection. Spillover from such programs can cause unintended fitness and demographic consequences for wild conspecifics. The range of possible management practices to minimize such consequences vary in their control of genetic and demographic processes. Here, we use a model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics to evaluate alternative management approaches to minimizing unintended consequences of aquaculture escapees. We find that, if strong natural selection occurs between escape and reproduction, an extremely maladapted (i.e., nonlocal-origin, highly domesticated) stock could have fitness consequences analogous to a weakly diverged cultured stock; otherwise, wild population fitness declines with increasing maladaptation in the cultured stock. Reducing escapees through low-level leakage is more effective than reducing an analogous number of escapees from large, rare pulses. This result arises because low-level leakage leads to the continual lowering of wild population fitness and subsequent increased proportional contribution of maladapted cultured escapees to the total population. Increased sterilization efficacy can cause rapid, nonlinear reductions in unintended fitness consequences. Finally, sensitivity to the stage of escape indicates a need for improved monitoring data on how the number of escapees varies across life cycle stages.

AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) escapees from commercial salmon farms in Washington State, USA, and British Columbia, Canada, arecaught in fisheries from Washington State to Alaska. A large escape from a farm near Cypress Island, Washington, was likely to have been the cause of increased abundance of Atlantic salmon in Juan de Fuca Strait and higher than average catches on the west coast of Vancouver Island during the summer of 1996. The catch of Atlantic salmon in Alaska in 1996 exceeded the sum of catches in all previous years. The number of escapees recorded in fresh water has been increasing, with more than 210 adult fish observed in 29 rivers in British Columbia during 1996. During the winter of 1995/1996, 39 Atlantic salmon were reported caught in the Salmon River on Vancouver Island. Analysis of the stomach contents of these fish indicated that some were feeding in fresh water.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance and associated genes are ubiquitous and ancient, with most genes that encode resistance in human pathogens having originated in bacteria from the natural environment (eg, β-lactamases and fluoroquinolones resistance genes, such as qnr). The rapid evolution and spread of "new" antibiotic resistance genes has been enhanced by modern human activity and its influence on the environmental resistome. This highlights the importance of including the role of the environmental vectors, such as bacterial genetic diversity within soil and water, in resistance risk management. We need to take more steps to decrease the spread of resistance genes in environmental bacteria into human pathogens, to decrease the spread of resistant bacteria to people and animals via foodstuffs, wastes and water, and to minimize the levels of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria introduced into the environment. Reducing this risk must include improved management of waste containing antibiotic residues and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.

AB  - Soil is a large reservoir of microbial diversity and the majority of antimicrobial compounds used today in human and veterinary health care have been isolated from soil microorganisms. The Darwinian hypothesis of an 'arms-shields race' between antibiotic producers and resistant strains is often cited to explain antibiotic resistance gene determinants (ARGD) origins and diversity. ARGD abundance and antibiotic molecule exposure are, however, not systematically linked, and many other factors can contribute to resistance gene emergence, selection and dissemination in the environment. Soil is a heterogeneous habitat and represents a broad spectrum of different ecological niches. Soil harbours a large genetic diversity at small spatial scale, favouring exchange of genetic materials by means of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) that will contribute to ARGD dissemination between bacteria and eventually acquisition by pathogen genomes, therefore threatening antibiotic therapies. Our current knowledge on the extent of the soil resistome abundance and diversity has been greatly enhanced since the metagenomic revolution and help of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Different ecological hypotheses explaining their high prevalence in soil and questioning their transfer rate to pathogens, in respect to these recent experimental results, will be discussed in the present review.

AB  - Keywords: antibiotic resistance, gyrA, Piscirickettsiasalmonis, quinolones.Piscirickettsia salmonis is a gram-negative, pleomor-phic coccoid-shaped and facultative intracellularﬁsh pathogenic bacterium, that causes piscirickettsi-osis, a disease also known as salmonid rickettsialsepticaemia (SRS) (Fryer et al. 1990). In Chile,P. salmonis was isolated for the ﬁrst time in 1989,but probably has been present since 1983 (Bravo C Rozas &Enriquez 2013). SRS has also been reported inimportant salmon producing countries such asCanada, Ireland, Scotland and Norway, but with alower economic impact (Rozas & Enriquez 2013).P. salmonis cells are slow growing and hard to culti-vate in free-cell media, which has hindered its isola-tion and further characterization. However, recentlydescribed supplemented media (Mikalsen et al.2008) facilitate their growth and the antibiotictesting assays to evaluate effective antimicrobial ther-apy. In this regard, quinolones were the former mostwidely used antimicrobial compounds in Chileanaquaculture, especially as a ﬁrst line drug againstSRS.In Chile, a large proportion of antibiotics is usedfor prophylaxis rather than for chemotherapy. Forinstance, in comparison with Norway and Canada,1500 and eight times more antimicrobials wereneeded to obtain similar amounts of salmon inChile in 2007 (Cabello et al. 2013). The same year,930 metric tons of antibiotics were mostly used insalmon production. Of those antibiotics, 24% werequinolones (Cabello et al. 2013). This practice hasalready altered the microbiota of sediments in closeproximity to aquaculture sites, where a signiﬁcantfraction of isolated bacteria is antibiotic resistant(Buschmann et al. 2012). Therefore, the emer-gence and potential spread of antibiotic-resistantP. salmonis isolates cannot be ruled out.Twenty P. salmonis isolates cultured from kid-ney samples of diseased ﬁsh collected from diversegeographic origin (Fig. 1) between 2010 and2012 were phenotypically characterized for quinol-ones susceptibility. The isolates were grown onagar (Mikalsen et al. 2008), at 18 °C for 10 daysand kept frozen in liquid nitrogen. For antibioticsensitivity testing, the minimal inhibitory concen-tration (MIC) for enroﬂoxacin, ﬂumequine andoxolinic acid were assessed according to theinstructions given by the Clinical and LaboratoryStandards Institute (CLSI), guide M49-A. 96-wellmicroplates containing twofold serial dilutions(0.03–64 lgmL

AB  - Institutions matter for development but there is no clear consensus on how existing institutions can be transformed to better accommodate economic activities in an inclusive and sustainable manner (Acemoglu and Johnson 2012). Institutions can be defined in various ways. In this chapter, we consider institutions as mechanism that shape agents’ behaviors: “a system of social factors that conjointly generate a regularity of behavior” (Greif 2006, 30). Here, a system is considered as the combination of ‘rules of the game’, norms, beliefs, routines, organizations, and interactions that influence the outcome and the behavior of the various agents involved. It is also “self-sustaining salient patterns of social interactions, as represented by meaningful rules that every agent knows and are incorporated as agents’ shared beliefs about how the game is played and to be played” (Aoki 2007, 6). The common point in the above statements is the idea that institutions are the mechanisms that determine the individuals’ behaviors as well as the outcomes of complex interaction among stakeholders.

AB  - Populations of aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria occurring in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy rainbow trout were estimated using a dilution plate technique. Data revealed a progressive decline in numbers of aerobic bacteria along the digestive tract from oesophagus to lower intestine. However, the highest numbers were recovered from the intestinal contents and faeces. Anaerobes were generally restricted to the upper intestine and intestinal contents. The aerobic component of the bacterial microflora from the digestive tract was equated with Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus circulans, Bac. megaterium, coryneforms, Grampositive irregularly shaped rods, Flavobacterium sp., Kurthia sp., Microhacterium sp., Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas spp., Ps.fluorescens and Ps. pseudoalcaligenes. Evidence from scanning electron microscopy pointed to a general lack of colonization of the gut wall: instead, microorganisms were abundant in the intestinal contents. Antimicrobial compounds, i.e. oxolinic acid, oxytetracycline and sulphafurazole (which are commonly used to combat infections by Gramnegative bacterial fish pathogens), caused an increase in bacterial numbers throughout the digestive tract, with maximal numbers in the lower intestine. The bacteria, comprising an essentially different range of taxa, were generally resistant to the antibiotics in use. Conversely, erythromycin and penicillin G, which are used to treat some diseases caused by Gram-positive bacteria, caused a rapid reduction in bacterial numbers within the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture has emerged as a successful economic industry generating high economic revenues to invest in the development of Chiloe region, Southern Chile. However, salmon aquaculture also consumes a substantial amount of ecosystem services, and the direct and indirect impacts on human wellbeing are still unknown and unexplored. This paper identifies the synergies and trade-offs caused by the salmon industry on a range of ecosystem services. The results show that large economic benefits due to the increase of provisioning ecosystem services are also causing a reduction on regulating and cultural services. Despite the improvement on average income and poverty levels experienced in communities closely associated with the sector, this progress is not large enough and social welfare did not improve substantially over the last decade. The rest of human wellbeing constituents in Chiloe region have not changed significantly compared to the development in the rest of the country.

AB  - Summary
Greenhouse gas emissions caused by food production are receiving increased attention worldwide. A problem with many studies is that they only consider one product; methodological differences also make it difficult to compare results across studies. Using a consistent methodology to ensure comparability, we quantified the carbon footprint of more than 20 Norwegian seafood products, including fresh and frozen, processed and unprocessed cod, haddock, saithe, herring, mackerel, farmed salmon, and farmed blue mussels. The previous finding that fuel use in fishing and feed production in aquaculture are key inputs was confirmed. Additional key aspects identified were refrigerants used on fishing vessels, product yield, and by-product use. Results also include that product form (fresh or frozen) only matters when freezing makes slower transportation possible. Processing before export was favorable due to the greater potential to use by-products and the reduced need for transportation. The most efficient seafood product was herring shipped frozen in bulk to Moscow at 0.7 kilograms CO2 equivalents per kilogram (kg CO2-eq/kg) edible product. At the other end we found fresh gutted salmon airfreighted to Tokyo at 14 kg CO2-eq/kg edible product. This wide range points to major differences between seafood products and room for considerable improvement within supply chains and in product choices. In fisheries, we found considerable variability between fishing methods used to land the same species, which indicates the importance of fisheries management favoring the most resource-efficient ways of fishing. Both production and consumption patterns matter, and a range of improvements could benefit the carbon performance of Norwegian seafood products.

AB  - Abstract Global warming is expected to affect the ecosystem in the Northeast Atlantic, and substantial changes will also affect the aquaculture industry. Farming of salmon and trout is the biggest aquaculture industry in Norway, with an export value of about 3 billion US dollars in 2007. The objective of the paper is to analyze the potential economic effect a general increase in sea temperature can have on the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry. The assessment of the economic impact of global warming is made possible by estimating a growth function, which explicitly includes sea water temperature. The analysis compares the economic effect of a climate change on fish farming plants in the south and the north of Norway. The scenarios are based on a model with monthly seasonal variation in temperature.

Florfenicol is an important antibiotic in veterinary medicine that is used extensively in aquaculture, including salmon farming in Chile. We analysed a set of 119 florfenicol-resistant Gram-negative bacilli from seven freshwater Chilean salmon farms for the molecular determinants involved in the florfenicol resistance. Ninety-seven of these strains were glucose non-fermenting bacilli, mainly belonging to the Pseudomonas genus, whereas 22 strains were glucose-fermenters. The floR gene was detected in 26 strains (21.8%) that had been isolated from three of the seven salmon farms. Most of the floR-carrying strains were glucose fermenters (21 strains), and most of the floR-carrying strains were also resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline. The minimum inhibitory concentrations against florfenicol were assessed in the presence and absence of the efflux pump inhibitor Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide (MC-207,110). There was evidence that in the majority of non-fermenting bacteria (82 strains), florfenicol resistance was at least partially mediated by non-specific efflux pump systems. Given the diversity of antibiotic resistance patterns observed in this study in the floR-positive isolates, a single antibiotic has the potential to co-select for a diversity of resistances. For this reason, human health as well as animal health can potentially be impacted by the use of antibiotics in aquaculture. To assess this potential risk, future studies should focus on the ability of different antibiotics used in aquatic environments to co-select for multiple resistances, the molecular basis of this diversity of resistance, and whether the genes conferring resistance can be transferred to other bacteria, including those of human health concern.

AB  - AIM: Species distribution models are useful tools for depicting important habitat, assessing abundance and orienting conservation efforts. For small populations in poorly studied ecosystems, available data are often scarce and patchy. To overcome this limitation, we aim to evaluate the use of different data types within a hierarchical Bayesian framework with the goal of modelling the abundance and distribution of a small and highly migratory population of blue whale (BW, Balaenoptera musculus) summering in Chilean Northern Patagonian (CNP). LOCATION: CNP, Eastern South Pacific (ESP). METHODS: We constructed a Bayesian hierarchical species distribution Model (HSDM), combining a binomial N‐mixture model used to model BW groups counts in line‐transect data (2009, 2012 and 2014) with a logistic regression for modelling presence‐availability data (2009–2016), allowing both models to share covariate parameters for borrowing strength in estimations. RESULTS: Distance to areas of high chlorophyll‐a concentration during spring before summering season (AHCC‐s) was the most important and consistent explanatory variable for assessing BW abundance and distribution in CNP. Incorporating accessorial presence‐only data reduced uncertainty in parameters estimation when comparing with a model using only line‐transect data, although other covariates of secondary importance failed to be retained in this model. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results remark the capability of HSDM for integrating different data types providing a potential powerful tool when data are limited and heterogeneous. Results indicate that AHCC‐s, and possibly thermal fronts, could modulate BW abundance and distribution patterns in CNP. Preliminary model‐based delimitations of possible priority conservation areas for BW in CNP overlap with highly used vessel navigation routes and areas destined to aquaculture.

AB  - Abstract In this study we measure change in total factor productivity for production of Atlantic salmon in Norway from 2001 to 2008. The Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) is used. Our results demonstrate that total factor productivity change measured by MPI increased from 2001 to 2005, but thereafter regressed. This is due to a regress in the technical change component of the MPI. The efficiency change component is as strong as before. We interpret this result as an indication that the industry has reached a level of technological sophistication from where it is difficult to make substantial progress. For an individual producer it may still be possible to improve efficiency by catching up relative to the best practice frontier. When this possibility is exhausted, the total factor productivity change for the industry may come to a halt. JEL Classification Codes: Q22, O33, D24, C43.

AB  - Algal blooms in Swedish marine waters are not a new phenomenon. In the low saline waters (4–7 °/oo) of the Baltic Sea blooms of Nodularia spumigena (Cyanophyceae) were documented one hundred years ago (Apstein, 1902). Nodularia has often bloomed since then, but the intensity and size seems to have increased lately, probably in response to eutrophication (Horstmann, 1975). These blooms have been correlated with warm summers with, low precipitation (Edler et al., 1982).

AB  - Increased farm salmon production has heightened concerns about the association between disease on farm and wild fish. The controversy is particularly evident in the Broughton Archipelago of Western Canada, where a high prevalence of sea lice (ectoparasitic copepods) was first reported on juvenile wild pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in 2001. Exposure to sea lice from farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was thought to be the cause of the 97% population decline before these fish returned to spawn in 2002, although no diagnostic investigation was done to rule out other causes of mortality. To address the concern that sea lice from fish farms would cause population extinction of wild salmon, we analyzed 10–20 y of fish farm data and 60 y of pink salmon data. We show that the number of pink salmon returning to spawn in the fall predicts the number of female sea lice on farm fish the next spring, which, in turn, accounts for 98% of the annual variability in the prevalence of sea lice on outmigrating wild juvenile salmon. However, productivity of wild salmon is not negatively associated with either farm lice numbers or farm fish production, and all published field and laboratory data support the conclusion that something other than sea lice caused the population decline in 2002. We conclude that separating farm salmon from wild salmon—proposed through coordinated fallowing or closed containment—will not increase wild salmon productivity and that medical analysis can improve our understanding of complex issues related to aquaculture sustainability.

AB  - Emergence and dissemination of bacteria resistant to multiple antimicrobials is currently one of the major global threats to human and animal public health. Veterinary use of antimicrobials in both developing and developed countries is many-fold greater than their use in human medicine and is an important determinant in selection of these resistant organisms. Our findings on antimicrobial use in salmon aquaculture and their impact on the environment and human health are highly relevant in light of the recently outlined National Plan Against Antimicrobial Resistance in Chile. Ninety-five percent of tetracyclines, phenicols and quinolones imported into Chile between 1998 and 2015 were for veterinary use, mostly in salmon aquaculture. Excessive use of antimicrobials at aquaculture sites was associated with antimicrobial residues in marine sediments 8 km distant, and the presence of resistant marine bacteria harboring easily transmissible resistance genes in mobile genetic elements to these same antimicrobials. Moreover, quinolone and integron resistance genes in human pathogens isolated from patients in coastal regions adjacent to aquaculture sites were sequence-identical to genes isolated from regional marine bacteria, consistent with genetic communication between bacteria in these different environments. Passage of antimicrobials into the marine environment can potentially diminish environmental diversity, contaminate wild fish for human consumption, and facilitate the appearance of harmful algal blooms and resistant zoonotic and human pathogens. Our findings suggest that changes in aquaculture in Chile that prevent fish infections and decrease antimicrobial usage will prove a determining factor in preventing human and animal infections with multiply antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in accord with the modern paradigm of One Health.

AB  - The goal of this review was to describe in some detail the Nordic aquaculture industries in order to illuminate the similarities and differences. Information that was gathered for each country includes aquaculture history, aquaculture acts and regulations, production and production systems, environmental concerns, organic aquaculture and outlook for the future. The information will be useful for risk assessments, design of risk-based surveillance programs and for construction of comparative risk profiles for endemic and exotic diseases affecting aquaculture in the Nordic countries. Aquaculture in the Nordic countries has a long history; beginning in the 1850s when hatcheries for restocking of salmon and trout were established in Norway. Nowadays, Atlantic salmon is the dominant cultured species in Norway and the Faroe Islands, whereas rainbow trout dominate in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Arctic char and cod are most important in Iceland. Other important cultured species include eel and blue mussels. There is much diversity in Nordic aquaculture industries in terms of production, farmed species, and production systems. Although the vast majority of the Nordic aquaculture production is for human consumption, significant numbers of fish are grown for restocking of rivers, lakes, or other bodies of freshwater or seawater.

AB  - The pursuit of sustainability in particular places and sectors often unravels at the edges. Efforts to tackle environmental problems in one place shift them somewhere else or are overwhelmed by external changes in drivers. Gains in energy efficiency of appliances used in houses are offset by greater total numbers or compensating changes in patterns of use. Analytical perspectives and practical initiatives, which treat production and consumption jointly, are needed to complement experiences and efforts with sector-, place-, product- and consumer-oriented approaches. There is now a growing body of scholarship exploring a diverse range of initiatives and experiments aimed at enabling sustainable production-consumption systems (PCSs). Different approaches make divergent assumptions about market institutions, government regulation, sociotechnical innovation, and actor partnerships. From this body of work flow useful insights for others who would engage, for example, in redesigning relationships around services...

AB  - Large annual escapees of farmed Atlantic salmon enhance the risk of extinction of wild populations through genetic and ecological interactions. Recently, we documented evolutionary change in gene transcription between farmed and wild Atlantic salmon after only five generations of artificial selection. While differences for most quantitative traits are expected to gradually dilute through repeated backcrossing to wild populations, the genetic basis of gene transcription has been shown to be largely nonadditive and hybrid crosses may display unexpected inheritance patterns. This makes it difficult to predict to what extent interbreeding between farmed and wild individuals will change the genetic makeup of wild salmon populations. Here, we compare the genome-wide gene transcription profiles of Norwegian wild salmon to that of a second generation hybrid cross [backcross: (Farmed X Wild) X Wild]. Over 6% (298, q-value < 0.01) of the detected genes exhibited highly significantly different transcription levels, and the range and average magnitude of those differences was strikingly higher than previously described between pure farmed and wild strains. Most differences appear to result from nonadditive gene interactions. These results suggest that interbreeding of fugitive farmed salmon and wild individuals could substantially modify the genetic control of gene transcription in natural populations exposed to high migration from fish farms, resulting in potentially detrimental effects on the survival of these populations. This further supports the idea that measures to considerably reduce the number of escaped farmed salmon and their reproduction in the wild are urgently needed.

AB  - This article summarizes the eutrophication of two sea areas: 1) the Baltic Sea and in particular a coastal area which is affected primarily by effluents from a tertiary sewage plant; and 2) the Kattegat and in particular the Laholm Bay, which is affected primarily by nutrient inputs from agriculture and forest land. During this decade, inputs of N and P to these larger sea areas have increased by factors of approximately 4 to 6 and >8, respectively. Internal nutrient transport and atmospheric deposition is discussed. It is concluded that N availablility generally limits primary production, except in the Bothnian Bay, where P has this role. P is, however, the limiting factor at times in some coastal areas, and in the Baltic for N-fixing blue-green-algae, which bloom in warm summers when low N/P ratios prevail. Noted eutrophication effects are localized elevated primary production, decreased depth distribution and species richness of macroalgae. Eutrophication is most likely a stimulus to high benthic infaunal biomass and fish biomass in well ventilated sea areas. Other areas suffer today from almost permanent (the Baltic proper) or seasonal (the Kattegat) hypoxia with devastating effects on benthos and demersal fish. The N cycle and future possible consequences in relation to nutrient input are discussed. It is concluded that a reduction by at least half of external N and P inputs to the Baltic sea, and of N inputs to the Kattegat is needed to mitigate the negative effects of eutrophication The seas surrounding Sweden. > tniHef

AB  - Los lagos monomicticos templados del sur de Chile son generalmente oligotroficos de gran transparencia, baja productividad y aparente resistencia a perturbaciones tales como adiciones de fosforo. Este trabajo intenta explicar los bajos valores de clorofila de acuerdo a aproximaciones descriptivas y experimentales. Se utilizan aqui tres escalas de aproximacion; (a) una microescala en espacio y tiempo con manipulaciones experimentales de nitrogeno (N), fosforo (P) y luz en 24 limnocorrales ubicados en una bahia del lago Llanquihue, (b) una escala mayor analizando 18 meses de muestreo en 10 sitios del lago Llanquihue agrupados como sitios de cultivo de salmones, bahias de ciudades y sitios de control, (c) una escala aun mayor en tiempo y espacio monitoreando semestralmente por 9 anos los lagos Puyehue, Rupanco, Llanquihue en la region de los Lagos Araucanos y el lago Yelcho en la region nor- patagonica. En el muestreo intra lago en el Llanquihue, los valores de fosforo total variaron entre 1 y 12 mg L-1 en los distintos sitios, mostrando efecto de sitio marginales, P = 0,09 (sitios de cultivo de salmones tuvieron los valores mayores). Sin embargo las concentraciones de clorofila a (Chl-a) fueron generalmente bajas (< 2 mg L-1) y no indicaron efectos de sitio. Las concentraciones de nitrogeno organico disuelto (DIN) fueron menores que 30 mg L-1 y mostraron mejor poder predictivo sobre las variaciones de Chl-a. El analisis entre lagos mostro los valores mas bajos de Chl-a en el lago Yelcho (0,7 µg L-1) y los mayores en el lago Puyehue (2,1 µg L-1). Los valores de P total mostraron un patron similar sin embargo no hubo tendencias temporales claras en los 9 anos de muestreo. La razon molar N/P para las formas disueltas fue generalmente menor que 20. En el experimento en limnocorrales el N tuvo un efecto significativo positivo (P< 0,001) sobre la concentracion de Chl-a en cambio ni el P ni la disponibilidad de luz mostraron efectos significativos. Otro resultado notable fue que la concentracion de Chl-a fue superior en los limnocorrales control que en el lago. En todos los lagos estudiados los valores de N total no excedieron 20 mmol L-1 y las concentraciones de P total no superaron los 0,8 mmol L-1 lo que sugeriria particularmente una limitacion por N como un elemento clave en la regulacion de la Chl-a y productividad. Un factor adicional regulador de la productividad y biomasa, y que solo se evalua indirectamente aqui, seria la gran profundidad de mezcla, caracteristica peculiar de los lagos templados del hemisferio sur y que tiene un mejor poder explicativo, afectando negativamente la concentracion de Chl-a de los lagos. Su efecto tambien puede explicar el aumento de la Chl-a en los limnocorrales con un epilimnion forzadamente muy reducido. Si la gran profundidad de mezcla condiciona la productividad, entonces las tramas troficas de los lagos de profundo epilimnion debieran estar mas ligadas al bentos y zonas costeras

AB  - The mat forming bacteria covering organic matter-enriched and anoxic marine sediments underlying a salmon farm in Southern Chile, were examined using 16S rRNA gene phylogenies. This mat was absent in the sea bed outside the direct influence of the farm (360 m outside fish cages). Based on nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences (similar to 1500 bp), mat-forming filamentous cells were settled as the sulphur-oxidizing and putatively dissimilative nitrate-reducing Beggictoa spp., being closely related (up to 97% sequence identity) to Beggiatoa spp. identified in eutrophic shallow sediments in northern Europe (Danish Limfjorden and German Dangast inlets). Their phylogenetic affiliation was consistent with their morphology as vacuolated and sulphur-containing cells arranged on tandem along trichomes (18 to 28 mu m diameter). Additionally, deltaproteobacterial sulphate reducers, Sulfurospirillum, Sulfurovum and Fusibacter were detected according to partial 16S rRNA gene sequences (similar to 500 bp). Their concurrence with Beggiatoa suggested an intense and complex sulphur cycle within the surface of these aquaculture-affected sediments, which may have important implications for the necessity of more efficient benthic-bioremediation of finfish aquaculture in Chile and worldwide.

AB  - The message conveyed in this chapter is that economic development depends on and may be limited by ecosystem life support. Through case studies of fisheries and aquaculture in Scandinavia, we illustrate that there is a strong complementarity between these human activities and the life-supporting environment, and argue that the life support environment is the precondition for their socio-economic development. The quantitative estimates reveal that Baltic fisheries and Norwegian fish farming are dependent on large ecosystem support areas, and that coastal seas put constraints on the possibilities to physically expand fisheries and aquaculture. In all of the studies reviewed the biophysical support from coastal seas is estimated to be at least twice as high as the total biophysical support from society required to sustain fisheries and aquaculture. The results are discussed in relation to basic ecological economic principles, conventional exploitative development, limits to scale and sustainability issues. We suggest that fisheries and aquaculture management would benefit from combining experiences gained in local-level community-based resource management with principles of ecological engineering.

AB  - Southern Chile encompasses one of the most extensive fjord regions of the world, the Patagonia, currently exposed to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. These fjord ecosystems provide important services to humans, which have not been adequately measured and valued. As a consequence, ecosystem services are commonly ignored in public policy design and in the evaluation of development projects. Here we tackle questions that are highly relevant for the nation’s development, namely (1) understanding fjord functioning, and (2) developing management strategies based on ecosystem services, in order to secure simultaneous and adequate use of these ecosystems which area influenced by ecological (e.g., biogeochemical) and productive (e.g., aquaculture, fisheries) processes. We also seek to strengthen the analysis of fjord ecosystem value from the economical (including coastal zoning), socio-cultural, institutional, and governmental points of view. In addition, the investigation of current and future effects of climate change on this large region offers a unique opportunity to understand the social and economic consequences of a global phenomenon at local to regional scales. Biogeochemical and socio-economic models will be used to simulate future scenarios under a gamut of management options.

AB  - Abstract A highly sensitive real-time PCR procedure to detect and quantify the number of Pisciricketsia salmonis units in seawater samples from affected farm sites has been developed. The purpose was to determine a fallowing period that would allow safe restocking of the target farm with new fish. Bacterial load was determined in water samples by comparing the obtained amplification values against a standard curve generated by the amplification of known concentrations of the ITS-ribosomal component of P. salmonis DNA, cloned in a suitable vector. The standard curve was linear over the range of 10(1)-10(10) log units. Target samples were taken every 10 days over a 40-day period, at 5 m depth and at the surface. In a highly affected area of southern Chile, the number of bacterial units in farm water decreased to zero at day 50. Therefore, a fallowing period of 50 days post-removal of cages of affected fish appears to be appropriate before restocking. This procedure could be adapted to control disease problems because of other pathogens in fish farm waters.

AB  - We report changes in brain serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity, along with plasma cortisol concentrations, occurring during the initial 24-h period following the establishment of dominant-subordinate relationships in pairs of rainbow trout. Immediately (within 5 min) after the termination of staged fights for social dominance, a large increase in blood plasma cortisol was observed in both fight losers (future subordinate fish) and winners (future dominant fish). In dominant fish, cortisol decreased rapidly (within 3 h) to the level of unstressed controls, while continuing to increase in subordinate fish. At 3 h following fights, the brain serotonergic system was activated in both dominant fish and subordinate fish, at least in some brain regions (telencephalon). This effect was reversed in dominant individuals within 24 h of social interaction, whereas in subordinate fish a substantial activation of the serotonergic system was manifest in all brain regions by 24 h. Similarly, a strong increase in brain catecholaminergic activation was indicated after 24 h of social interaction in subordinate fish, but not in dominant fish. Relationships between plasma cortisol and brain serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the various experimental groups suggest that these systems influence cortisol secretion under normal conditions and during moderate or short-term stress.

AB  - The ecological impact of parasite transmission from fish farms is probably mediated by the migration of wild fishes, which determines the period of exposure to parasites. For Pacific salmon and the parasitic sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, analysis of the exposure period may resolve conflicting observations of epizootic mortality in field studies and parasite rejection in experiments. This is because exposure periods can differ by 2-3 orders of magnitude, ranging from months in the field to hours in experiments. We developed a mathematical model of salmon-louse population dynamics, parametrized by a study that monitored naturally infected juvenile salmon held in ocean enclosures. Analysis of replicated trials indicates that lice suffer high mortality, particularly during pre-adult stages. The model suggests louse populations rapidly decline following brief exposure of juvenile salmon, similar to laboratory study designs and data. However, when the exposure period lasts for several weeks, as occurs when juvenile salmon migrate past salmon farms, the model predicts that lice accumulate to abundances that can elevate salmon mortality and depress salmon populations. The duration of parasite exposure is probably critical to salmon-louse population dynamics, and should therefore be accommodated in coastal planning and management where fish farms are situated on wild fish migration routes.

AB  - Amazon beef and soybean industries, the primary drivers of Amazon deforestation, are increasingly responsive to economic signals emanating from around the world, such as those associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, "mad cow disease") outbreaks and China's economic growth. The expanding role of these economic "teleconnections" (coupled phenomena that take place in distant places on the planet) led to a 3-year period (2002-2004) of historically high deforestation rates. But it also increases the potential for large-scale conservation in the region as markets and finance institutions demand better environmental and social performance of beef and soy producers. Cattle ranchers and soy farmers who have generally opposed ambitious government regulations that require forest reserves on private property are realizing that good land stewardship-including compliance with legislation-may increase their access to expanding domestic and international markets and to credit and lower the risk of "losing" their land to agrarian reform. The realization of this potential depends on the successful negotiation of social and environmental performance criteria and an associated system of certification that are acceptable to both the industries and civil society. The foot-and-mouth eradication system, in which geographic zones win permission to export beef, may provide an important model for the design of a low-cost, peer-enforced, socioenvironmental certification system that becomes the mechanism by which beef and soy industries gain access to markets outside the Amazon.

AB  - Salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis Kroyer have caused disease problems in farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. since the mid-1970s in Norway. High infection intensities and premature return of wild sea trout Salmo trutta L. were first reported in 1992. Later emaciated wild Atlantic salmon smolts carrying large amounts of lice have been observed both in fjords and offshore, The Norwegian Animal Health Authority regulations to control the problem, which came into operation in 1998, included compulsory louse level monitoring in farms and maximum legal numbers of lice per fish. Here, we present a model of salmon louse egg production in Norway and show that the effect of the current public management strategy is critically dependent on the yearly increase in salmon production. This is because the infection pressure is the product of the number of fish in the system, and the number of lice per fish. Due to the much larger number of farmed than wild salmonids, it is highly likely that lice originating from farmed salmon infect wild stock. Estimated tolerance limits for wild salmonids vary widely, and the level of louse egg production in farms which would be neaded to decimate wild populations is not known. Two possible thresholds for total lice egg production are investigated: (1) 1986 to 1987 level (i.e. before adverse effects on sea trout were recorded), and (2) a level corresponding to a doubling of the estimated natural infection pressure. The farm lice per fish limits that would have to be observed to keep louse production within the 2 thresholds are calculated for the period 1986 to 2005. A steady decrease in the permitted number of lice per fish may keep the total louse production stable, but the number of salmon required for verification of lice numbers will increase as the prevalence to be verified is decreased. At threshold (2), the model estimated that lice limits should have been 0.05 louse per fish in 1999. This would require 60 fish from each pen to be collected, anaesthetised and examined for a good estimate at a confidence level of 95%. Such sample numbers are likely to be opposed by farmers. The use of national delousing programs to solve the problem is discussed.

AB  - As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers approving a genetically modified (GM) Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ), it faces fundamental questions of risk analysis and impact assessment. The GM salmon—whose genome contains an inserted growth gene from Pacific chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) and a switch-on gene from ocean pout ( Zoarces americanus )—would be the first transgenic animal approved for human consumption in the United States ( 1 , 2 ). But the mechanism for its approval, FDA's new animal drug application (NADA) process ( 2 ), narrowly examines only the risks of each GM salmon compared with a non-GM salmon ( 2 , 3 ). This approach fails to acknowledge that the new product's attributes may affect total production and consumption of salmon. This potentially excludes major human health and environmental impacts, both benefits and risks. Regulators need to consider the full scope of such impacts in risk analyses to avoid unintended consequences ( 4 ), yet FDA does not consider ancillary benefits and risks from salmon market expansion ( 2 , 3 ), a result of what may be an overly narrow interpretation of statutes.

AB  - ABSTRACTAquaculture has been the world's fastest growing food production sector with an annual growth rate of 8%. Total aquaculture supply increased dramatically from 0.7 mMT in 1950 to 90 mMT in 2012. Growth of the global seafood supply was made possible through adoption of new technologies that brought more control over aquaculture production processes. This review presents evidence of supply-side technological progress that spurred growth in shrimp, salmon, and tilapia production from 1981 to 2012. Greater availability of hatchery-raised post-larvae, better feed formulations, and a shift in preferred shrimp species from Penaeus monodon to Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) Litopenaeus vannamei appear to have been critical technological advances that triggered rapid growth of shrimp farming. Nutritionally balanced feed, use of automated labor-saving equipment, genetic selection programs, and development of vaccines triggered growth of Atlantic salmon production.

AB  - Important antibiotics in human medicine have been used for many decades in animal agriculture for growth promotion and disease treatment. Several publications have linked antibiotic resistance development and spread with animal production. Aquaculture, the newest and fastest growing food production sector, may promote similar or new resistance mechanisms. This review of 650+ papers from diverse sources examines parallels and differences between land-based agriculture of swine, beef, and poultry and aquaculture. Among three key findings was, first, that of 51 antibiotics commonly used in aquaculture and agriculture, 39 (or 76%) are also of importance in human medicine; furthermore, six classes of antibiotics commonly used in both agriculture and aquaculture are also included on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) list of critically important/highly important/important antimicrobials. Second, various zoonotic pathogens isolated from meat and seafood were observed to feature resistance to multiple antibiotics on the WHO list, irrespective of their origin in either agriculture or aquaculture. Third, the data show that resistant bacteria isolated from both aquaculture and agriculture share the same resistance mechanisms, indicating that aquaculture is contributing to the same resistance issues established by terrestrial agriculture. More transparency in data collection and reporting is needed so the risks and benefits of antibiotic usage can be adequately assessed.

AB  - Abstract There is interest in culturing Atlantic salmon Salmo salar to market-size in land-based, closed containment systems that use recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS), as this technology often enables facilities to locate near major markets, obtain permits, exclude obligate pathogens, and/or reduce environmental impacts. Use of land-based RAS to intensively culture market-size Atlantic salmon is a relatively new frontier and little information is available. Three trials were conducted to evaluate the performance of two North American strains of Atlantic salmon raised from post-smolt to market-size (4–5 kg) in a near-commercial scale (260 m 3 ), land-based RAS using only freshwater. St. John River (SJR) salmon were reared during the first trial, and Cascade salmon (CS1 and CS2) were evaluated during two subsequent trials. Salmon were received as fertilized “eyed” eggs and cultured on-site through the entire production cycle. The grow-out period began at 14–16 months post-hatch when salmon post-smolt weighed 0.34–0.75 kg on average. CS1 and SJR salmon grew 386–393 g/month to a mean size of 4.1–4.2 kg and CS2 salmon grew 413 g/month to a mean size of 4.9 kg prior to first harvest. Thereafter, weekly salmon harvests commenced for the next 6–19 weeks. The grow-out period, excluding harvest, lasted 9–10 months for each trial. Average water temperature was maintained at 15–16 °C. Consistently linear growth rates were achieved by each population suggesting that growth was relatively independent of fish cohort/genetic strain, fish size, and maximum biomass density, which was 35, 100, and 118 kg/m 3 for SJR, CS1, and CS2, respectively. Feed conversion ratios ranged from 1.07 to 1.10. Fish mortality (including culls) for SJR, CS1, and CS2 was 9.5, 6.6, and 7.5% of the original number of stocked fish, respectively. No obligate fish pathogens, kudoa, sea lice, or pervasive parasites were detected. Salmon were not vaccinated against specific pathogens; and no antibiotics, pesticides, or harsh chemotherapeutants were used. Hydrogen peroxide (50–100 ppm) and salt (10 ppt) were occasionally used to treat fungus during pre-smolt production, and salt (2–3 ppt) was used to treat fungus or ameliorate stress after handling events. No salmon escaped the facility due to built-in fish exclusion barriers. Early male maturation was observed during each trial. Male salmon began to exhibit maturation traits (kype, darkened skin coloration) at a mean weight of 1.5–2 kg and were removed from the grow-out system when they weighed 2–3 kg. SJR, CS1, and CS2 populations exhibited 37.0, 38.5, and 17.0% maturity, respectively. Fillet yield and product quality of immature, market-size salmon were comparable to reported measurements for commercially available salmon reared in net pens. This research suggests that it is biologically and technologically feasible to culture Atlantic salmon from post-smolt to market-size in a land-based RAS of suitable commercial scale; however, early male maturation could represent a production barrier. As of 2016, all-female Atlantic salmon eggs are commercially available and could provide an expedient solution to the problem of early male maturation in RAS.

AB  - The orographic effect of the Andes (30°S–55°S) on upwind precipitating clouds from midlatitude frontal systems is investigated using surface and satellite data. Rain gauges between 33°S and 44°S indicate that annual precipitation increases from the Pacific coast to the windward slopes by a factor of 1.8 ± 0.3. Hourly gauges and instantaneous satellite estimates reveal that the cross-barrier increase in annual precipitation responds to an increase in both the intensity and frequency of precipitation. CloudSat satellite data indicate that orographic effects of the Andes on precipitating ice clouds increase gradually from midlatitudes to subtropics, likely as a result of a reduction of synoptic forcing and an increase of the height of the Andes equatorward. To the south of 40°S, the thickness of clouds slightly decreases from offshore to the Andes. The total ice content increases substantially from the open ocean to the coastal zone (except to the south of 50°S, where there is no much variation over the ocean), and then experience little changes in the cross-mountain direction over the upstream and upslope sectors. Nevertheless, the maximum ice content over the upslope sector is larger and occurs at a lower level than their upwind counterparts. In the subtropics, the offshore clouds contain almost no ice, but the total and maximum ice content significantly increases toward the Andes, with values being much larger than their counterparts over the extratropical Andes. Further, the largest amounts of cloud ice are observed upstream of the tallest Andes, suggesting that upstream blocking dominates there.

AB  - The presence of residues of tetracycline, quinolones and antiparasitic drugs was investigated in wild fish captured around salmon aquaculture pens in Cochamo, Region X, Chile. Residues of both antibiotics were found in the meta [corrected] of two species of wild fish that are consumed by humans, robalo (Elginops maclovinus) and cabrilla (Sebastes capensis) [corrected] These findings suggest that the antibiotic usage in salmon aquaculture in Chile has nvironmental implications that may affect human and animal health. More studies are needed in Chile to determine the relevance of these findings for human and animal health and the environment to regulate this use of antibiotics.

AB  - In this article, we respond to concerns raised by Brooks and Jones (2008) about recent advances in sea lice and salmon population dynamics in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia. We show that the assessment by Brooks and Jones (2008) is thoroughly mistaken and that their conclusions are based on a combination of obfuscation, misrepresentation, and fundamental misunderstandings. The extinction hypothesis is not actually a hypothesis at all, but rather an inevitable consequence of sustained population decline. Local extinction of Broughton Archipelago pink salmon can be prevented if population declines are turned around, and the data and models suggest this can be achieved if the infestations are stopped. We have organized our responses in an itemized manner according to the headings and subheadings in Brooks and Jones (2008).

AB  - Juvenile pink salmon that entered a marine ecosystem along the eastern margin of Queen Charlotte Strait in 2003 and returned as adults in 2004 had very high marine survival. The early seaward migration and midsummer rearing in 2003 were in an area containing 16 active Atlantic salmon farms. Two species of sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi, were commonly found on farmed salmon and juvenile Pacific salmon during the early rearing period of the pink salmon. Mobile L. salmonis and C. clemensi were most abundant on farmed Atlantic salmon from February to May and on pink salmon in June. Chalimus stages were the dominant stages on pink salmon to the end of May. Mobile stages of C. clemensi were the dominant stages and species of sea louse on farmed Atlantic salmon and pink salmon at about the same time in June. DNA studies showed that local juvenile pink salmon were in the area until August. The exceptional returns of the brood year suggest that pink salmon populations and farmed Atlantic salmon coexisted successfully during 2003 within an environment that included sea lice and farmed Atlantic salmon. The processes responsible for the high marine survival cannot be identified with certainty, but they could include increased freshwater discharge in 2003, which may have resulted in lower salinity less favourable to sea louse production, increased inflow of nutrient-rich water to the study area, and the introduction of a Provincial Action Plan that required mandatory louse monitoring and established a fallowed migration corridor for pink salmon.

AB  - Farmed salmon represents 20% of the total volume of the world's salmon supply. Norwegian salmon farmers produce more than 50% of the world's farmed salmon. Rapid expansion of this industry raises important issues about market model specification. We specify and test models with varying degrees of market power, including third-degree price discrimination, using Norwegian export data from 1983 to 1988. Results indicate that Norwegian exporters have limited ability to engage in regional price discrimination, although they may have discriminated after the third quarter of 1987. Seasonal price discrimination, however, may have taken place because demand is more inelastic in periods when fresh wild-caught salmon are unavailable.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to human health and well-being. To effectively combat this problem we need to understand the range of different resistance genes that allow bacteria to resist antibiotics. To do this the whole microbiota needs to be investigated. As most bacteria cannot be cultivated in the laboratory, the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in the non-cultivatable majority remains relatively unexplored. Currently the only way to study antibiotic resistance in these organisms is to use metagenomic approaches. Furthermore, the only method that does not require any prior knowledge about the resistance genes is functional metagenomics, which involves expressing genes from metagenomic clones in surrogate hosts. In this review the methods and limitations of functional metagenomics to isolate new antibiotic resistance genes and the mobile genetic elements that mediate their spread are explored.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AR) detected by disc diffusion and antimicrobial resistance genes detected by DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction with amplicon sequencing were studied in 124 marine bacterial isolates from a Chilean salmon aquaculture site and 76 from a site without aquaculture 8 km distant. Resistance to one or more antimicrobials was present in 81% of the isolates regardless of site. Resistance to tetracycline was most commonly encoded by tetA and tetG; to trimethoprim, by dfrA1, dfrA5 and dfrA12; to sulfamethizole, by sul1 and sul2; to amoxicillin, by blaTEM ; and to streptomycin, by strA-strB. Integron integrase intl1 was detected in 14 sul1-positive isolates, associated with aad9 gene cassettes in two from the aquaculture site. intl2 Integrase was only detected in three dfrA1-positive isolates from the aquaculture site and was not associated with gene cassettes in any. Of nine isolates tested for conjugation, two from the aquaculture site transferred AR determinants to Escherichia coli. High levels of AR in marine sediments from aquaculture and non-aquaculture sites suggest that dispersion of the large amounts of antimicrobials used in Chilean salmon aquaculture has created selective pressure in areas of the marine environment far removed from the initial site of use of these agents.

AB  - Fine-scale habitat selection of Chilean dolphins was studied between January and April 2002 through shore- based theodolite tracking in order to investigate the environmental and behavioural determinants of habitat use, and to evaluate the interactions between this species and aquaculture activities in Yaldad Bay, southern Chile. During 293.5 h of effort, movement and habitat selection patterns of dolphins exhibited a significantly concentrated use of only 21% of the entire study area. Correspondence analysis showed that shallow waters (5-10 m), proximity to coast and rivers were the most significant environmental parameters determining fine- scale dolphin distribution patterns, with foraging the most frequently observed activity. Aquaculture activities in the area were observed to affect dolphin habitat use patterns by restricting space available for biologically important dolphin behaviours.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a dire clinical problem with important ecological dimensions. While antibiotic resistance in human pathogens continues to rise at alarming rates, the impact of environmental resistance on human health is still unclear. To investigate the relationship between human-associated and environmental resistomes, we analyzed functional metagenomic selections for resistance against 18 clinically relevant antibiotics from soil and human gut microbiota as well as a set of multidrug-resistant cultured soil isolates. These analyses were enabled by Resfams, a new curated database of protein families and associated highly precise and accurate profile hidden Markov models, confirmed for antibiotic resistance function and organized by ontology. We demonstrate that the antibiotic resistance functions that give rise to the resistance profiles observed in environmental and human-associated microbial communities significantly differ between ecologies. Antibiotic resistance functions that most discriminate between ecologies provide resistance to β-lactams and tetracyclines, two of the most widely used classes of antibiotics in the clinic and agriculture. We also analyzed the antibiotic resistance gene composition of over 6000 sequenced microbial genomes, revealing significant enrichment of resistance functions by both ecology and phylogeny. Together, our results indicate that environmental and human-associated microbial communities harbor distinct resistance genes, suggesting that antibiotic resistance functions are largely constrained by ecology.

AB  - The salmon industry in Chile experienced large and rapid growth over the past three decades and by 2008 Chile was the second largest producer of salmon in the world after Norway. However, the industry was affected by a sanitary crisis that impacted on its growth and forced a change in production strategies. This paper argues that the post-crisis scenario shows the deepening of an enclave economy in Los Lagos region that is changing the way in which the industry participates in rural development. Starting with a literature review on enclave and extractive economies I characterise the salmon industry as an enclave, and then examine evidence from the field to identify local effects in rural communities of this new form of relationship. I conclude by calling for a revitalisation of the geographical debates on enclave economies from a political ecology perspective to better understand communities’ interaction with extractive economies.

Pathogens are growing threats to wildlife. The rapid growth of marine salmon farms over the past two decades has increased host abundance for pathogenic sea lice in coastal waters, and wild juvenile salmon swimming past farms are frequently infected with lice. Here we report the first investigation of the potential role of salmon farms in transmitting sea lice to juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka).

AB  - Recent data on fishmeal and fish-oil supply are presented identifying key producer countries and raw material sources and distinguishing between whole fish and by-products. The conversion of these raw materials into marine ingredients is discussed and global volumes presented. This is followed by a summary of the main countries using these marine ingredients over recent years. Uses of fishmeal and fish-oil by market segment are then presented. From this, a global mass balance of inputs and outputs is derived which allows the calculation of the input-to-output ratios (fish in:fish out; FIFO) for the main aquaculture production types to be made. Current areas of focus by the industry include the need to demonstrate sustainable practice, more strategic use of marine ingredients, greater use of fishery and land-animal by-products as well as vegetable substitutes, and novel sources of essential omega-3 fats, notably the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Implications are drawn for future supply prospects of fishmeal and fish-oil and their future role in aquaculture, agriculture and human health.

AB  - Aquaculture is developing rapidly at a global scale and sustainable practices are an essential part of meeting the protein requirements of the ballooning human population. Locating aquaculture offshore is one strategy that may help address some issues related to nearshore development. However, offshore production is nascent and distinctions between the types of aquatic farming may not be fully understood by the public–important for collaboration, research, and development. Here we evaluate and report, to our knowledge, the first multinational quantification of the relative sentiments and opinions of the public around distinct forms of aquaculture. Using thousands of newspaper headlines (Ntotal = 1,596) from developed (no. countries = 26) and developing (42) nations, ranging over periods of 1984 to 2015, we found an expanding positive trend of general ‘aquaculture’ coverage, while ‘marine’ and ‘offshore’ appeared more negative. Overall, developing regions published proportionally more positive than negative headlines than developed countries. As case studies, government collected public comments (Ntotal = 1,585) from the United States of America (USA) and New Zealand mirrored the media sentiments; offshore perception being particularly negative in the USA. We also found public sentiment may be influenced by local environmental disasters not directly related to aquaculture (e.g., oil spills). Both countries voiced concern over environmental impacts, but the concerns tended to be more generalized, rather than targeted issues. Two factors that could be inhibiting informed discussion and decisions about offshore aquaculture are lack of applicable knowledge and actual local development issues. Better communication and investigation of the real versus perceived impacts of aquaculture could aid in clarifying the debate about aquaculture, and help support future sustainable growth.

AB  - SLICE™ (active ingredient 0.2% emamectin benzoate (EMB)), a feed premix developed by Schering-Plough Animal Health for the control of sea lice on cultured salmonids, is registered for use in several countries and is being prescribed on an emergency basis in Canada and the United States. The concentration of EMB in feed administered to farmed salmon ranges from 1 to 25 μg g−1. To determine the acute toxicity of the compound to juvenile and adult American lobster (Homarus americanus), commercial salmon feed was coated with SLICE™ at a range of concentrations and provided to the animals for 7 d in the laboratory. The LC50 is estimated to be 644 μg g−1 (95% CI=428, 1275) for adult lobsters and >589 μg g−1 for stage V and VI juvenile lobsters. The consumption of medicated pellets by adult lobsters decreased significantly with increasing concentration of EMB. Adult lobsters that died during the study had a significantly greater concentration of emamectin B1a in their muscle tissue than those that survived. These results support the conclusion that salmon feed medicated with EMB at the concentrations used by the aquaculture industry is unlikely to pose an acute lethal threat to adult and small juvenile American lobsters.

AB  - Fish farms release dissolved and particulate waste into the ecosystem and the most important impacts on the water column and the sediments are described at different scales (A, B, C zones). An overview of the ethical and legal frameworks for management of aquaculture is given, introducing the ecosystem approach to regulation through the DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) approach and EQSs (Environmental Quality Standards). The Scottish loch Creran is used as a case study due to the existence of long term monitoring and the presence of aquaculture in the loch. Finally the prospects for management of aquaculture within the European Water Framework Directive is discussed, and it is predicted that the implementation may either result in limited changes (e.g., same practice but out- phasing of environmental hazards) or major changes (e.g., ecosystem approach to aquaculture through polycultures) to Scottish regulation.

AB  - Gross pathological assessment of amoebic gill disease (AGD) is the only non-destructive, financially viable method for rapid and broad-scale disease management of farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in Tasmania. However, given the presumptive nature of this diagnosis, the technique has been considered questionable. This study investigated the degree of conformity between clinical signs and histological lesions observed in a commercial setting. Three groups of Atlantic salmon (n = 42, 100 and 100, respectively) were collected from various farm sites in southern Tasmania between December 2001 and April 2003. Micro-stereoscopic analysis showed that grossly affected tissue regions correspond to areas of hyperplastic lamellar fusion, generally in association with attached Neoparamoeba sp. Agreement between gross signs of AGD and histopathological diagnosis was compared. Kappa analysis indicated moderate to good agreement between methods (kappa = 0.52-0.74). Individual cases of disagreement were further scrutinized and several factors were found to influence the level of agreement between the two methods. Stage of disease development, lesions derived from other pathogens, assessor interpretation/experience, sampling methods, histological technique and/or experience were potential confounding factors. It was concluded that clinical diagnosis is acceptable as a farm-monitoring tool only. Removal of grossly affected tissue and subsequent histological examination is recommended to improve diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - The spread of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) from salmon farms may threaten some wild salmon populations. Infestations of wild juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) have been associated with high mortality and population decline. Using stock–recruit data for pink salmon from the central coast of British Columbia, we analyzed how fishing mortality and spatial covariation combine with louse infestation to affect pink salmon population dynamics. The results indicate substantial coherence in survival at nested spatial scales — large-scale regional covariation and smaller scale covariation within management areas. Populations exposed to salmon farms (those from the Broughton Archipelago) show a sharp decline in productivity during sea lice infestations relative to pre-infestation years. Unexposed populations (comprising four management areas) did not experience a change in productivity during infestation years and had similar productivity to exposed populations before infestations. Our results s...

El primer estudio se realizo en diciembre 2012 en un centro de cultivos ubicado en el Canal Huito, cuya salinidad fue de 26 y el segundo estudio se realizo en abril 2013 en un centro de cultivos en el Canal Chidhuapi, donde la salinidad fue de 32. En el primer estudio se evaluo la tolerancia de hembras y machos adultos de C. rogercresseyi al agua dulce y tambien la tolerancia de esta especie en truchas banadas con agua dulce por 30 min de exposicion. En el segundo estudio se evaluo la tolerancia de machos y hembras adultas a diferentes gradientes de salinidad, y tambien la tolerancia de copepoditos a la baja salinidad. En el primer estudio el 100% de los machos y hembras estuvieron inconscientes despues de 30 min de exposicion. Sin embargo, una vez que los parasitos inconscientes fueron retornados a agua de mar se registro una supervivencia de 93% en machos, 73% en hembras ovigeras y 100% en hembras sin sacos. En el segundo estudio se registro una supervivencia de 45% en hembras y 20% en machos sometidos a salinidad de 15 por 24 h. Los copepoditos no sobrevivieron a salinidad de 25. La eficacia registrada en el desprendimiento de C. rogercresseyi en las truchas tratadas con agua dulce fue de 57%, con una mayor tolerancia de las hembras en comparacion con los machos. Los parasitos colectados desde el sector con 26 de salinidad, mostraron mayor tolerancia al agua dulce en comparacion con los parasitos colectados del sitio con 32 de salinidad.

AB  - Since 2000, an increasing number of humpback whale sightings have been recorded in northern Chilean Patagonia (mostly between 41.5°S and 44°S) from dedicated aerial and marine surveys and also opportunistic and land-based platforms during austral summer and autumn months.
Based on local knowledge from the early years of coastal whaling suggesting the historic presence of humpback whales in the area, and more recent observations confirming feeding groups, mother–calf pairs, and philopatry, it is proposed that a proportion of the eastern South Pacific humpback whales consistently use the Chiloe-Corcovado region to feed and nurse their young.
This mid-latitude area could be regarded as the northernmost feeding ground for humpback whales in South America, extending the previous known range some 1300 km north.
These findings provide further evidence for alternative life-strategies other than traditional migration and highlight the importance of northern Patagonian fjords to resolve questions that are central for large baleen whale conservation and management such as the extent and characteristics of spatio-temporal habitat use and overlap with human activities.
The need for future research on the migratory movements and population structure of this poorly understood population of humpback whales is emphasized, while an account is given of the threats they currently face.

AB  - This paper addresses the genetic consequences of aquaculture on natural fish populations. The study is motivated by rapidly increasing numbers of intentionally and accidentally released fish and is based on empirical observations reported in the literature. A wide variety of outcomes, ranging from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement, has been observed following releases of cultured fish into natural settings. Where genetic effects on performance traits have been documented, they always appear to be negative in comparison with the unaffected native populations. These findings are consistent with theoretical considerations of the implications of elevated levels of gene flow between cultured and locally adapted natural populations; they raise concerns over the genetic future of many natural populations in the light of increasing numbers of released fish. Strategies for the genetic protection of native populations from the effects of aquaculture are outlined including more secure co...

AB  - Mjelnerad, I. B., Refseth, U. H., Karlsen, E., Balstad, T., Jakobsen, K. S. and Hindar, K. 1997. Genetic differences between two wild and one farmed population of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) revealed by three classes of genetic markers. Hereditas 127: 239-248. Lund, Sweden. ISSN 0018-0661. Received April 7, 1997. Accepted August 21, 1997 Genetic diversity within and between two wild and one farmed population of Atlantic salmon was estimated by 12 variable enzyme loci, three single locus- and one multilocus DNA minisatellite probe. The farmed salmon were fifth-generation fish from one of the principal commercial strains in Norway and the wild salmon were from the rivers Numedalslagen and Tana, Norway. All three classes of markers detected significant differentiation between the populations, with the farmed population being genetically most divergent. The farmed fish showed less genetic variability than the wild populations, as all techniques revealed a lower (14 %-45 %) number of variable bands/alleles in this group. However, only multilocus DNA fingerprinting detected a significantly lower level of heterozygosity within the farmed population. Estimates of average heterozygosity within populations were almost identical for single locus and multilocus minisatellites (0.558 and 0.548, respectively), which were more than three times higher than for polymorphic allozymes (0.162). Estimates of interpopulation genetic differentiation, however, gave highly concordant results between the allozymes and minisatellites (Fst range: 0.106-0.135). Our results show that fifth generation farmed Atlantic salmon differ significantly from wild salmon in loci others than those chosen for selection in the breeding program. The study also suggests that the choice of genetic markers for studies of Atlantic salmon depends on the aim of the study (within- versus between-population variability).

AB  - In a coastal area of southern Chile (41° S), the major ammonium assimilating enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) was detected in a green dinoflagellate bloom during April 2003. High chlorophyll a concentrations (1000 μg L -1 ) attributable to Gymnodinium cf. chlorophorum in surface waters were associated with high and very low nitrate reductase activities. Coincident with the bloom, dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations were near the detection limit (NO 3 - + NH 4 + <0.5 μM). Since GS correlates with the use of ammonium as an external nitrogen source, we suggest that GS activity seems to be a good indicator of ammonium utilization in a period dominated by a single dinoflagellate species.

AB  - Furunculosis was first discovered in a fish farm in Norway in 1964, following the importation of rainbow trout from Denmark. The disease spread to several farms and to wild fish in the River Numedalslagen, occurring there until 1979. It was eradicated at several farms, the last being disinfected in 1969. In 1985, furunculosis was discovered in marine fish farms in Nord-Trondelag, following importation of salmon smolts from Scotland. The disease reached More og Romsdal in 1988, by which time 32 fish farms were infected in the two counties. By the end of 1992, 550 farms were infected. The disease spread concurrently in natural watercourses, from 22 in 1989, to 74 by the end of 1992. Rapid spread of the disease was associated with several factors including escapes from fish farms, possibly via transport of fish between farms, and natural movement of wild fish in the sea. The disease was not associated with particular physical characteristics in these watercourses, but large aggregations of fish beneath waterfalls combined with high water temperature may trigger disease outbreaks. The ecological consequences of furunculosis are not known. However, some river populations of adult salmon, sea trout and brown trout have suffered. Furunculosis may result in serious negative consequences for populations if a significant number of the brood stock die before spawning.

AB  - Antimicrobials are heavily used in Chilean salmon aquaculture. We previously found significant differences in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria between sediments from an aquaculture and a non-aquaculture site. We now show that levels of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) are significantly higher in antimicrobial-selected marine bacteria than in unselected bacteria from these sites. While ARG in tetracycline- and florfenicol-selected bacteria from aquaculture and non-aquaculture sites were equally frequent, there were significantly more plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes per bacterium and significantly higher numbers of qnrB genes in quinolone-selected bacteria from the aquaculture site. Quinolone-resistant urinary Escherichia coli from patients in the Chilean aquacultural region were significantly enriched for qnrB (including a novel qnrB gene), qnrS, qnrA and aac(6')-1b, compared with isolates from New York City. Sequences of qnrA1, qnrB1 and qnrS1 in quinolone-resistant Chilean E. coli and Chilean marine bacteria were identical, suggesting horizontal gene transfer between antimicrobial-resistant marine bacteria and human pathogens.

Juvenile and adult populations were monitored in 15 stocked and 15 unstocked streams from summer 1980 until summer 1985. During the summers following the planting of presmolts, the number of juveniles per square metre of pool surface area was higher in the stocked streams than in the unstocked streams. However, wild juveniles were significantly less abundant in the stocked streams during the 2 yr when density of wild juveniles was estimated separately from hatchery juveniles. Adult returns to the stocked streams were not significantly different from adult returns to the unstocked streams, but returns tended to be earlier in the stocked streams than in the unstocked streams. Despite similar numbers of adults per kilometre in the stocked streams and unstocked streams in the years the presmolts returned to spawn, the resulting densities of juveniles in the stock...

AB  - The bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis is the aetiological agent of piscirickettsiosis a severe disease that has caused major economic losses in the aquaculture industry since its appearance in 1989. Recent reports of P. salmonis or P. salmonis-like organisms in new fish hosts and geographical regions have increased interest in the bacterium. Because this gram-negative bacterium is still poorly understood, many relevant aspects of its life cycle, virulence and pathogenesis must be investigated before prophylactic procedures can be properly designed. The development of effective control strategies for the disease has been limited due to a lack of knowledge about the biology, intracellular growth, transmission and virulence of the organism. Piscirickettsiosis has been difficult to control; the failure of antibiotic treatment is common, and currently used vaccines show variable long-term efficacy. This review summarizes the biology and characteristics of the bacterium, including its virulence; the infective strategy of P. salmonis for survival and evasion of the host immune response; the host immune response to invasion by this pathogen; and newly described features of the pathology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and transmission. Current approaches to the prevention of and treatment for piscirickettsiosis are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Salmon production is an important industry in Scotland, with an estimated retail value >£1 billion. However, this salmon industry can be threatened by the invasion and spread of diseases. To reduce this risk, the industry is divided into management areas that are physically separated from each other. Pathogens can spread between farms by local processes such as water movement or by long-distance processes such as live fish movements. Here, network modelling was used to investigate the importance of transmission routes at these two scales. We used different disease transmission rates ( β ), where infected farms had the probability of 0.10, 0.25 or 0.50 per month to infect each contacted farm. Interacting farms were modelled in such a way that neighbours within a management area could infect each other, resulting in two contacts per farm per month. In addition, non-local transmission occurred at random. Salmon are input to marine sites where they are raised to harvest size, the site is then fallowed; in the model the effects of different fallowing strategies (synchronised, partial synchronised and unsynchronised fallowing at the management area level) on the emergence of diseases were investigated. Synchronised fallowing was highly effective at eradicating epidemics when transmission rate is low ( β  = 0.10) even when long distance contacts were fairly common (up to 1.5 farm −1  month −1 ). However for higher transmission rates, long distance contacts have to be kept at much lower levels (0.15 contacts month −1 where β  = 0.25) when synchronised fallowing was applied. If fallowing was partially synchronised or unsynchronised then low rates of long-distance contact are required (0.75 or 0.15 farm −1  month −1 ) even if β  = 0.10. These results demonstrate the potential benefits of having epidemiologically isolated management areas and applying synchronised fallowing.

AB  - To study future, sustainable production systems, a step-wise method was used to create three future scenarios for pig production based on different sustainability goals. The first scenario focused on animal welfare and the natural behavior of the animals. The second targeted low impacts on the environment and the efficient use of natural resources. The third scenario aimed at product quality and safety. Each scenario fulfilled different aspects of sustainability, but there were goal conflicts because no scenario fulfilled all sustainability goals. The scenarios were then parameterized. The environmental impact was calculated using the life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, and the economic cost was calculated from the same data set. The cost per kilo of pork was highest for the animal welfare scenario and similar for the other two scenarios. The environmental scenario had the lowest environmental impact, and the product-quality scenario the highest. The results are discussed based on different future priorities.

AB  - Relationships between prices of goods offer motives of interest in at least two areas: market integration and product aggregation. There is a close relationship between market integration and aggregation, which may increase the usefulness of market integration studies. In this article, these relationships are developed and illustrated by an application to the world salmon market. It is shown that the Law of One Price holds for an international market with five salmon species. This result has significant implications for the world salmon market regarding both product aggregation in demand analyses and international trade policy.

AB  - A central socio-economic challenge in fish breeding arises from issues relating to access to and exclusive rights of genetic resources. Breeding companies need legal or biological protection measures to assure revenues from genetic improvement and investment in genetic material. Fish farmers and fish breeders need access to genetic resources for food production and further development and sustainable use of fish genetic material. How can a balance be created between the need for unencumbered and free access, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the need to ensure a right to the results from breeding and research?



First, we provide a brief outline of the rationale for ensuring access to and for using legal measures for protection of breeding materials in aquaculture. Secondly, we examine how technological developments and biological features present options and barriers that will affect choices relating to access and property right issues to fish genetic resources.

AB  - External morphological characteristics were used to identify escaped farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in a coastal salmon fishery in County Antrim, Northern Ireland during four fishing seasons and at an adjacent freshwater location (R. Bush) during a 5-year period. Out of a total of 36 326 adult salmon examined in the fishery, 883 (2.4%) were identified as having escaped from sea cages. Annual average values ranged from 0.26% to 4.04% of the fish caught. Occurrence of escapees entering an adult trap in fresh water averaged 0.88%, with a range of 0.13–2.62%, depending on year. No correlation between presence in the marine fishery and in fresh water was evident, the latter year-round figures probably being more indicative of presence of escapees in spawning stocks. Entry to fresh water was significantly later on average for escaped farmed salmon, compared with wild salmon.

AB  - The tremendous growth of the fish farming industry in Norway over the past decades was supported by new designs and materials for fish farms, enabling bigger fish cages to be positioned in more exposed sea areas. Today, the nets of most fish cages in Norway are made from nylon. Nylon nets are lightweight, relatively easy to handle and at the low cost end of proposed net materials. However, nylon nets also have some unfortunate characteristics like low abrasion resistance and limited tensile strength. Thus, new net materials are proposed to better prevent escapes, protect fish from predator attacks, improve the stability of fish cages and reduce bio-fouling. Some of these materials are stiff in at least one direction and there still is a lack of knowledge about the behavior of nets with bending stiffness in currents and waves. The aim of this study was to determine how nets with bending stiffness deform in different currents and how the deformation influences the drag on the nets and to compare the results with predictions from a numerical model. Three types of net (PET, copper and steel) were clamped to a solid steel bar on the top side, but were otherwise unrestricted. Reflective markers were mounted on the nets and an optical tracking system was used to determine the position of the markers during the tests, thus allowing the determination of the deformation of the net panels. The forces on the net panels were measured with a multi-axis force/torque sensor system. The nets were subjected to several flow speeds between 0.1 and 0.9 m/s. It is shown that bending stiffness and density of nets affect net deformation, as both parameters impact the balance between drag and gravitational forces on the nets. Net deformation leads to a decrease of the projected net area. As the rate of deformation with current speed varies greatly between different net types, the discrepancy between measured drag and drag values normalized to the projected net area at different current speeds follows different relationships for different nets. A numerical model, FhSim was able to predict net deformation of nets with bending stiffness well and it is shown that FhSim could not only account for the effect of bending stiffness on net deformation, but also that the model captures the structural dynamics of nets with bending stiffness in a current.Copyright © 2013 by ASME

AB  - The twofold aim of this article is to model the structure of the Norwegian food farming industry for trout and salmon and to provide estimates for the scale elasticity and substitution possibilities. A translog functional form of the long run cost function is specified and estimated. The empirical findings indicate that both capital-labor and capital-feed input combinations are substitutes. However, the labor-feed relationship is ambiguous; these inputs could be both complements and substitutes. Scale economies existed in the industry in 1982-1983 in the sense that the homogeneous version of the cost function shows statistically increasing returns to scale. However, it can be noted that the measure of the cost efficiency of large farms compared to small farms probably incorporates the combined effect of regulation of the industry and scale economies. The findings also indicate that there is a nonneutral scale expansion as factor intensity alters between small and large farms.

AB  - Abstract: A model of the joint dynamics of change in population size N and evolution in a quantitative trait z, as a result of a general form of density dependence, local stabilizing selection, and immigration of individuals deviating from the local optimum, is analyzed. For weak selection and migration, a reduction in total equilibrium population size below the initial level without immigration, K, is shown to occur if the immigrants deviates more than \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $\sqrt{8}=2.83$ \end{document...

AB  - Piscirickettsia salmonis is a facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacterium (Mauel, Ware & Smith 2008; Mikalsen et al. 2008) originally isolated from fish in Chile and constitutes one of the main problems in farmed salmonids and marine fish worldwide (see reviews by Almendras & Fuentealba 1997; Mauel & Miller 2002; Fryer & Hedrick 2003). This fastidious pathogen was first observed in southern Chile in 1989 (Bravo & Campos 1989; Branson & Diaz-Mu~ noz 1991; Cvitanich, Garate & Smith 1991), then in western Canada (Brocklebank et al. 1992), Ireland (Rodger & Drinan 1993), Scotland (Grant et al. 1996), Norway (Olsen et al. 1997), eastern Canada (Cusack, Groman & Jones 2002) and southern USA (Arkush et al. 2005). Currently, an official report from the Chilean authorities indicates that piscirickettsiosis or salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) caused by P. salmonis has a high prevalence with 68% of fish diagnosed as positive (www.sernapesca.cl). Treatments with antimicrobial drugs represent the only measure to control SRS in farmed fish. In fact, in 2010, its use in Chilean salmon farms added up to approximately 103 000 kg (www. sernapesca.cl). Chemotherapy with a fluorinated structural synthetic analogue to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol, florfenicol (FLO) and oxytetracycline (OTC), two bacteriostatic agents with broad-spectrum activity, has often been the choice of drugs for treating the outbreaks. However, since their first use, the results of antimicrobial treatments have been inconsistent and have failed to effectively control SRS (Branson & Diaz-Mu~ noz 1991; Cvitanich et al. 1991). The irregular effects of the chemotherapy in controlling P. salmonis in salmonids indicate that the bacterium has developed drug resistance. The drug resistance mechanisms for some fish pathogens have been studied but have not been characterized for P. salmonis (http://www.who.int/topics/foodborne_diseases/aquaculture_rep_13_16june2006% 20.pdf). Therefore, the appearance of potentially resistant isolates has raised efforts to provide data about the antimicrobial susceptibility of P. salmonis isolates to different antibiotics.

AB  - During the last decade, empirical evidence of regional agglomeration economies has emerged for some industries. This paper argues that externalities from agglomeration are not only present in some manufacturing and service sectors, but can also occur in primary industries, such as aquaculture. Econometric analyses in this literature have primarily estimated rather restrictive production function specifications on aggregated industry data. Here, cost functions are estimated on firm-level observations of Norwegian salmon aquaculture farms. This approach provides us with measures of the cost savings due to agglomeration externalities. Furthermore, we avoid aggregation biases and can test a rich set of hypotheses on how these externalities affect the structure of costs at the firm level. According to the econometric estimates, there are significant cost savings associated with localization in regions with a large salmon aquaculture industry, suggesting the presence of positive agglomeration externalities.

AB  - High infestation rates of the Sea Louse ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ) have been reported on juvenile salmonids in Europe since 1989; however, this species has not been reported on juvenile Pacific salmonids until now. Magnitude of Sea Lice infestation was examined in 2001 on juvenile Pink Salmon ( Oncorhynchus gorbuscha ) migrating through a British Columbia archipelago. On average, the 751 juvenile Pink Salmon sampled weighed 2.25 g (± 0.039 SE), were infected with 11.3 (± 0.41 SE) Sea Lice per fish and 6.1 (± 0.24SE) Sea Lice per gram host weight. Fully 75.0% of fish were infected at loads equivalent to or higher than the lethal limit reported for much larger Sea Trout ( Salmo trutta ) post-smolts. Abundance (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 100.95, p<0.0001) and intensity (KW= 70.05, p<0.0001) of lice, and mean number of lice/g host weight (K-W= 112.23, p<0.0001) were significantly higher in juvenile Pink Salmon in close proximity to salmon farms, than in Pink Salmon distant from salmon farms.

AB  - Today, over 94% of all adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are in the aquaculture niche and wild numbers continue to decline while aquaculture numbers increase. The developmental and evolutionary forces in the aquaculture or "domestic" niche are so unlike those in the wild niche that two distinct biologies are being created from the original Atlantic salmon species. We may now need to recognize a new biological entity — Salmo domesticus — and treat it as an "exotic" when it escapes into the wild. Escapement therefore raises important concerns about ecological and genetic impacts, both within and outside the native range of Salmo salar. This paper explains why escaped domestic Atlantic salmon have had an impact on wild Atlantic salmon populations and now threaten Pacific salmonids as well. A polarization of views between aquaculturists and environmentalists will not resolve the problems. The three interest groups in fisheries — aquaculture, biodiversity, and capture — must begin to work together if we are to take up the challenge of preserving biodiversity and if aquaculturists, who hold the future of Atlantic salmon in their hands, can be expected to willingly prevent further impacts from their industry. Resume : Aujourd'hui, 94 % des saumons de l'Atlantique (Salmo salar) adultes sont issus de l'aquaculture, et les effectifs de saumons sauvages continuent de decroitre tandis que les effectifs provenant de l'aquaculture augmentent. Les forces agissant sur le developpement et l'evolution des saumons d'aquaculture, ou des saumons « domestiques », sont si differentes de celles agissant sur les saumons sauvages que deux biologies distinctes se sont formees a partir du saumon atlantique d'origine. Nous pouvons aujourd'hui considerer une nouvelle entite biologique — Salmo domesticus — et la traiter comme une entite exotique quand elle s'echappe dans le milieu naturel. Le fait que des saumons d'aquaculture s'echappent dans le milieu naturel souleve des inquietudes importantes au chapitre des impacts ecologiques et genetiques tant a l'interieur qu'a l'exterieur de l'aire de repartition naturelle de Salmo salar. Le present article explique pourquoi les saumons atlantiques domestiques evades ont eu un impact sur les populations sauvages de l'espece et menacent maintenant aussi les salmonides du Pacifique. Les problemes ne trouveront pas de solution dans une polarisation des positions des aquaculteurs et des environnementalistes. Les trois groupes d'interets du secteur des peches — les aquaculteurs, les personnes qui se preoccupent de la biodiversite, et les pecheurs — doivent commencer a collaborer si nous voulons reussir a preserver la biodiversite et si nous voulons faire en sorte que les aquaculteurs, qui ont l'avenir du saumon atlantique en leur pouvoir, en arrivent a freiner volontairement les impacts de leur industrie.

AB  - Atlantic salmon (n = 1682) from 27 anadromous river populations and two nonanadromous strains ranging from south-central Maine, USA to northern Spain were genotyped at 12 microsatellite DNA loci. This suite of moderate to highly polymorphic loci revealed 266 alleles (5-37/locus) range-wide. Statistically significant allelic and genotypic heterogeneity was observed across loci between all but one pairwise comparison. Significant isolation by distance was found within and between North American and European populations, indicating reduced gene flow at all geographical scales examined. North American Atlantic salmon populations had fewer alleles, fewer unique alleles (though at a higher frequency) and a shallower phylogenetic structure than European Atlantic salmon populations. We believe these characteristics result from the differing glacial histories of the two continents, as the North American range of Atlantic salmon was glaciated more recently and more uniformly than the European range. Genotypic assignment tests based on maximum-likelihood provided 100% correct classification to continent of origin and averaged nearly 83% correct classification to province of origin across continents. This multilocus method, which may be enhanced with additional polymorphic loci, provides fishery managers the highest degree of correct assignment to management unit of any technique currently available.

AB  - Hansen, L. P., Jacobsen, J. A., and Lund, R. A. 1999. The incidence of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in the Faroese fishery and estimates of catches of wild salmon. ‐ ICES Journal of Marine Science, 56: 200‐206. The proportion of Atlantic salmon escaped from fish farms and caught in the Faroese salmon fishery was estimated using scale analysis. Samples were obtained of fish landed in the commercial fishery from 1980/1981 to 1990/1991 fishing seasons and from research catches in the 1991/1992 to 1995/1996 seasons. The material collected was in some years limited to only part of the fishing season. The estimated proportion of farmed salmon in the fishery was relatively low from 1980/1981 to 1986/1987, but increased considerably thereafter, and reached a peak in the 1989/1990 fishing season when more than 40% of the catch was estimated to be of farmed origin. Later, the proportion declined, and in recent seasons the proportions of farmed salmon were estimated to be around 20%. These estimates were used to split the Faroese catch into wild and farmed components. It is concluded that if farmed components in salmon catches are not accounted for, catches of wild salmon will be overestimated and assessments of fisheries and stocks of wild salmon confounded. Furthermore, the increase observed in catch per unit of eVort (c.p.u.e.) in the 1980s and early 1990s might have been caused by an increasing abundance of farmed salmon. ? 1999 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea

AB  - This study compared sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestation rates on juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon in five nearshore areas of the British Columbia coast selected on the basis of proximity to salmon farms. A 10-week study in the Broughton Archipelago found sea lice were 8.8 times more abundant on wild fish near farms holding adult salmon and 5.0 times more abundant on wild fish near farms holding smolts than in areas distant from salmon farms. We found that 90% of juvenile pink and chum salmon sam- pled near salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago were infected with more than 1.6 lice·(g host mass) -1 , a pro- posed lethal limit when the lice reach mobile stages. Sea lice abundance was near zero in all areas without salmon farms. Salinity and temperature differences could not account for the higher infestation rates near the fish farms. The most immature life stages dominated the lice population throughout the study, suggesting the source of lice was a sta- tionary, local salmonid population. No such wild population could be identified. The evidence from this control-impact study points to a relationship between salmon farms and sea lice on adjacent, wild, juvenile salmon.

AB  - Twenty-five distinct tetracycline-resistant gram-negative bacteria recovered from four Chilean fish farms with no history of recent antibiotic use were examined for the presence of tetracycline resistance (tet) genes. Sixty percent of the isolates carried 1 of the 22 known tet genes examined. The distribution was as follows. The tet(A) gene was found in six isolates. The tet(B) gene was found in two isolates, including the first description in the genus Brevundimonas. Two isolates carried the tet(34) and tet(B) genes, including the first description of the tet(34) gene in Pseudomonas and Serratia and the first description of the tet(B) gene in Pseudomonas. The tet(H) gene was found in two isolates, which includes the first description in the genera Moraxella and Acinetobacter. One isolate carried tet(E), and one isolate carried tet(35), the first description of the gene in the genus Stenotrophomonas. Finally, one isolate carried tet(L), found for the first time in the genus Morganella. By DNA sequence analysis, the two tet(H) genes were indistinguishable from the previously sequenced tet(H) gene from Tn5706 found in Pasteurella multocida. The Acinetobacter radioresistens isolate also harbored the Tn5706-associated 1,063-bp IS element IS1597, while the Moraxella isolate carried a 1,026-bp IS-like element whose 293-amino-acid transposase protein exhibited 69% identity and 84% similarity to the transposase protein of IS1597, suggesting the presence of a novel IS element. The distribution of tet genes from the Chilean freshwater ponds was different than those that have previously been described from other geographical locations, with 40% of the isolates carrying unidentified tetracycline resistance genes.

AB  - We present a global-scale life cycle assessment of a major food commodity, farmed salmon. Specifically, we report the cumulative energy use, biotic resource use, and greenhouse gas, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions associated with producing farmed salmon in Norway, the UK, British Columbia (Canada), and Chile, as well as a production-weighted global average. We found marked differences in the nature and quantity of material/energy resource use and associated emissions per unit production across regions. This suggests significant scope for improved environmental performance in the industry as a whole. We identify key leverage points for improving performance, most notably the critical importance of least-environmental cost feed sourcing patterns and continued improvements in feed conversion efficiency. Overall, impacts were lowest for Norwegian production in most impact categories, and highest for UK farmed salmon. Our results are of direct relevance to industry, policy makers, eco-labeling programs, ...

AB  - Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is an alternative approach to mono-culture aquaculture that reduces environmental impacts of commercial aquaculture systems by combining the cultivation of fed species with extractive species. Shellfish play a critical role in IMTA systems by filter-feeding particulate-bound organic nutrients. They may also increase or decrease disease risk on farms by serving as reservoirs or barriers for important finfish pathogens such as infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). This study aimed to optimize culture and molecular assays in shellfish tissues and to determine the fate of ISAV in mussels, Mytilus edulis. To determine detection limits, qRT-PCR and culture assays in both CHSE- and ASK cells were optimized in ISAV-inoculated mussel tissue homogenates. Both qRT-PCR and culture assays performed in ASK cells had comparable detection limits of 102.8 TCID50 mL−1. The ISAV RNA genome was consistently detected in digestive gland tissue of ISAV-exposed mussels. Viable ISAV was not detected in mussel tissues by culture analysis in CHSE- and ASK cells. The fact that qRT-PCR analysis resulted in positive cycle threshold (CT) values that corresponded to the detectable range of ISAV in ASK culture assays suggests that little to no viable ISAV particles are present in the mussel tissues.

AB  - While there is a large body of literature investigating the effect of crop and livestock insurance on input and yield, limited attention has been paid to the effect of insurance on efficiency. This article investigates how insurance affects technical efficiency and whether insurance alters the utilized input quantity to a riskier bundle using the Norwegian salmon farming industry as a case. The results illustrate that insurance has an enhancing effect on production and efficiency and changes the utilized input mix—a well‐insured farmer uses more feed and less capital and labor than a less‐insured farmer. When linking this to each input's risk profile, the results indicate that insurance will induce the use of the risk‐increasing factor (feed) and reduce the use of the risk‐decreasing factors (labor and capital)—thereby increasing production risk and indicating moral hazard.

AB  - Abstract The effect of oxytetracycline (OTC) treatment on intestinal bacterial populations in juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar was evaluated. Oxytetracycline was administered by way of medicated feed to fish held in experimental tanks. Restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing of 16S rDNA from isolates were used to analyze the intestinal microbiota before, during, and after OTC administration. The microbiota from untreated fish was more diverse, consisting mainly of Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, Psycrobacter, and Brevundimonas spp. In contrast, the microbiota of the OTC-treated group was characterized by lower diversity and consisted only of Aeromonas, clustering with A. sobria and A. salmonicida. Antibiotic-resistant isolates were identified as Aeromonas spp.; sequencing the resistance determinant showed it to be the tetE gene. Overall, OTC treatment changed the composition of the intestinal microbiota of Atlantic salmon, as evidenced by a reduction in bacterial ...

AB  - Summary

Norwegian marine aquaculture is dominated by the production of salmon and rainbow trout. The Ministry of Fisheries is the main authority responsible for the licensing of new farms (1 licence = 12 000 m3> production volume) and the control of the industry. There is a tight co-operation with other authorities (such as environment, disease control, local government and labour) and the aquaculture industry. The aquaculture industry in Norway is strictly regulated, with an obligation to keep very detailed records at each farm. The regulatory system is based on environmental standards, set to meet the requirements for different kinds of use (such as aquaculture, recreation and fishing). It is left to the local authorities to set the limits allowed for each farm. Increasingly, the Modelling Ongrowing fish farms Monitoring system, or parts of it, is used to regulate the production and environmental impact of aquaculture at the farm level. Norway follows the EU regulations regarding food quality standards and the licensing process for medicines and pesticides, with a zero-detection limit for permitted levels of medicines and pesticides in aquaculture products at harvesting. The control system for the use of medicines in Norwegian aquaculture makes it possible to have detailed records of the use of all medicines at site level. Norway has the most detailed database registration of this kind in the world.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a critical threat to human and animal health. Despite the importance of antibiotics, regulators continue to allow antibiotics to be used in low-value applications--subtherapeutic dosing in animals, and spraying tobacco plants for blue mold, for example--where the benefits are unlikely to outweigh the costs in terms of increased resistance. We explore the application of a user fee in non-human uses of antibiotics. Such a fee would efficiently deter low value uses while also providing funding to support the development of the urgently needed new antibiotics.

AB  - Population management of Lepeophtheirus salmonis in Canada currently relies on chemotherapeutants to remove attached stages of the ectoparasite. However, some populations of L. salmonis are developing resistance to chemotherapeutants making alternate management measures necessary. This article explores the ability of filter-feeding shellfish [i.e. blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus)] to consume the copepodid stages of L. salmonis in the laboratory under static and flowing water conditions, with variable copepodid densities, and with the aid of a light attractant. Mytilus edulis consumed copepodids under both static and flowing water conditions, and the proportion of individuals ingested was similar at low and high copepodid densities, suggesting that M. edulis was not saturated at the concentrations tested. Also, M. edulis consumed more copepodids when a light attractant was present, suggesting that lights may be useful to concentrate widely dispersed copepodids around cultured shellfish in the field. Finally, P. magellanicus consumed the same number of copepodids as an equivalent total wet weight of M. edulis. During each of the four separate experiments, shellfish consumed between 18 and 38% of the copepodids presented per hour, suggesting that both species are well suited for low level removal of copepodids over time.

AB  - Intensive use of antimicrobial agents in aquaculture provides a selective pressure creating reservoirs of drug-resistant bacteria and transferable resistance genes in fish pathogens and other bacteria in the aquatic environment. From these reservoirs, resistance genes may disseminate by horizontal gene transfer and reach human pathogens, or drug-resistant pathogens from the aquatic environment may reach humans directly. Horizontal gene transfer may occur in the aquaculture environment, in the food chain, or in the human intestinal tract. Among the antimicrobial agents commonly used in aquaculture, several are classified by the World Health Organisation as critically important for use in humans. Occurrence of resistance to these antimicrobial agents in human pathogens severely limits the therapeutic options in human infections. Considering the rapid growth and importance of aquaculture industry in many regions of the world and the widespread, intensive, and often unregulated use of antimicrobial agents in this area of animal production, efforts are needed to prevent development and spread of antimicrobial resistance in aquaculture to reduce the risk to human health.

AB  - The chinook salmon DNA probe B2-2 was used to distinguish farm-reared (from two commercial farms) and native chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that were sampled from five populations on the west coast of Vancouver island. The Big Qualicum River population (east coast of Vancouver Island), which is believed to be the main progenitor of domesticated broodstocks used for aquaculture in British Columbia, was also sampled. The presence or absence and integrated optical densities (IODs) of three DNA fragments at 8.3 kilo base pairs (kbp) (band 1), 6.5 kbp (band 2), and 5.6 kbp (band 3) in the hybridization patterns of B2-2 on BamHI-restricted DNA were recorded for 269 chinook salmon. The frequency of occurrence of bands 2 and 3, and all seven measurements made of the relative and absolute values of the IODs of the three bands, varied significantly among populations. The IOD of band 3 provided the best discrimination among populations. The Big Qualicum and two fish farm populations were differentiated fr...

AB  - Introduction of vegetable ingredients in fish feed has affected the fatty acid composition in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L). Here we investigated how changes in fish feed affected the metabolism of mice fed diets containing fillets from such farmed salmon. We demonstrate that replacement of fish oil with rapeseed oil or soybean oil in fish feed had distinct spillover effects in mice fed western diets containing the salmon. A reduced ratio of n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fish feed, reflected in the salmon, and hence also in the mice diets, led to a selectively increased abundance of arachidonic acid in the phospholipid pool in the livers of the mice. This was accompanied by increased levels of hepatic ceramides and arachidonic acid-derived pro-inflammatory mediators and a reduced abundance of oxylipins derived from eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. These changes were associated with increased whole body insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Our data suggest that an increased ratio between n-6 and n-3-derived oxylipins may underlie the observed marked metabolic differences between mice fed the different types of farmed salmon. These findings underpin the need for carefully considering the type of oil used for feed production in relation to salmon farming.

AB  - . Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., of reared origin were distinguished from putative wild fish In the catch of a single salmon fishery in western Scotland. Fish in seven day-catches made in 1990 totalling 403 individuals were assessed formally for the presence of residual fin damage resulting from culture. Fifty-eight (22%) were classed as being of reared origin, on the basis of previously established criteria. Additional examination of 54 of these fish showed the pigment canthaxanthin to be detectable in the tissues of 35 (65%), which were therefore classed as having escaped from sea cages. Among the fish in which canthaxanthin could not be detected, a further 17 individuals (31% of the total) were classed as having escaped from sea cages on the basis of scale growth patterns. Scale growth patterns in the remaining two fish (4% of the total) were consistent with their having grown in a hatchery before escape or release.

Nevertheless, several antibiotics are natural products of microorganisms that have as yet poorly appreciated ecological roles in the wider environment. We isolated hundreds of soil bacteria with the capacity to grow on antibiotics as a sole carbon source. Of 18 antibiotics tested, representing eight major classes of natural and synthetic origin, 13 to 17 supported the growth of clonal bacteria from each of 11 diverse soils. Bacteria subsisting on antibiotics are surprisingly phylogenetically diverse, and many are closely related to human pathogens. Furthermore, each antibiotic-consuming isolate was resistant to multiple antibiotics at clinically relevant concentrations. This phenomenon suggests that this unappreciated reservoir of antibiotic-resistance determinants can contribute to the increasing levels of multiple antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria.

AB  - Kestavan maataloustuotannon tavoitteena on kayttaa luonnonvaroja taloudellisesti, yhteiskunnallisesti ja ekologisesti kestavalla tavalla. Kestava kaytto ei kuluta paaomaa, vaan luonnonvarojen uusiutumiskyky sailyy ja niiden maara pysyy vahintaan entisen suuruisena. Luonnon elinkykya yllapitaa myos lajien sisainen ja niiden valinen monimuotoisuuseli geneettinen diversiteetti. Biodiversiteetin sailyttaminen takaa myos ekosysteemien monimuotoisuuden, mika edellyttaa monenlaisten kasvu- ja elinpaikkojen olemassaoloa. Tama kirjallisuuskatsaus perehtyy kotielaintuotannon ja kotielainten jalostuksen vaikutuksiin ja mahdollisuuksiin kestavan kehityksen turvaamisessa. Lisatutkimusta tarvitaan optimoitujen jalostusohjelmien loytamiseksi, silla tuotannon intensiteetin nousu/elainyksikko keskinkertaisilla tuotostasoilla vahentaa ymparistohaittoja, mutta tuotantointensiseetin edelleen noustessa ei ymparistohaittojen vaheneminen enaa olekaan selvaa. Oikea painotus kestavyyden, eettisten arvojen, taloudellisuuden ja tuotanto-ominaisuuksien valilla on loydettava. Kaikkia jalostuskohteita ei biodiversiteetin takia kannata ottaa yhteen jalostusohjelmaan, vaan erikoisominaisuuksien sailyttamisen taloudellinen arvo eri roduilla on arvioitava. Kestavyyden, tuotantosairauksien ja geneettisen resistenssin periytymisasteet tulee maarittaa, jotta voidaan loytaa edistymisen kannalta tarkoituksenmukaiset painotukset. Lisaksi uusien tekniikoiden, kuten alkionsiirron, geenisiirron ja markkeriavusteisen valinnan kayttoa jalostuksen edistajina ja monimuotoisuuden yllapitajina varsinkin heikosti periytyvissa terveys-, hedelmallisyys- ja resistenssiominaisuuksissa on mahdollisuuksien mukaan tehostettava. Eri ominaisuuksien vuorovaikutukset eri ruokintamuotojen, tuotantoymparistojen ja olosuhteiden kanssa vaihtelevat ja jarkeva yhdistelma saattaa olla hyvinkin erilainen eri maissa. Juuri tahan erilaistumiseen pohjautuu jalostuspopulaatioiden maailmanlaajuinen vaihtelu. Kukin tuotantoelainlaji ja -systeemi on mallitettava eri paakohdat huomioon ottaen. Geenipankkitoiminnan ja sailytettyjen geenien kayttoonoton todelliset taloudelliset kustannukset ja hyodyt vaihtelevat suuresti sailytettavan rodun erikoisominaisuuksien taloudellisten kaytto- ja kulttuuriarvojen mukaan. Kansallisten jalostustavoitteiden vaikutus perinnolliseen muunteluun maailmanlaajuisesti juuri erikoistumalla on merkittavaa ja erilaisilla jalostusohjelmilla on mahdollisuuksia sailyttaa useampi jalostuspopulaatio kilpailukykyisena. Tuotannon kokonaisvaltainen mallittaminen eri aloilla tulee olemaan ehto kestavalle kehitykselle. Jalostuksen sopeuttaminen kestavan kehityksen vaatimuksiin ei ole ristiriidassa nykyisen linjan kanssa, vaan kyse on jarkevasti toteutettavasta optimointiprosessista.

AB  - It is widely recognized that mass media can affect public perception of risk. In recent years, the public has been exposed to stories on emerging health and environmental risks, including risks from aquaculture. Two key studies ("trigger events") compared contaminants in farmed and wild salmon and evaluated potential health risks of consumption. This study investigates how US newspaper coverage of farmed salmon fluctuated in the face of this emerging scientific information and which types of purported risks and benefits received the most attention. We hypothesized that media attention to farmed salmon would focus more on negative information (e.g., health risks) than on positive information (e.g., health benefits) and that those health risks highlighted most often would be dramatic, rare, or vivid. US newspaper stories specific to farmed salmon and published from 2000 to 2005 were collected from online databases (N = 206). Stories were content analyzed for amount of text covering various human health and environmental risks and health benefits associated with farmed salmon. Over all time periods, 49% of text about farmed salmon discussed human health risks, while benefits were described less than 10% of the time. The two trigger events corresponded with a shift in media attention away from environmental risks to human health risks, as media generally reported the studies' conclusions as true. Risks emphasized the most tended to be severe or dreadful, such as cancer and developmental defects, while other health risks and all environmental risks received much less attention. This pattern presented the public with a message of severe health consequences from consuming farmed salmon and could induce the public to perceive health risks as being much greater than could be offset by its health benefits.

AB  - Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, are naturally occurring parasites of salmon in sea water. Intensive salmon farming provides better conditions for parasite growth and transmission compared with natural conditions, creating problems for both the salmon farming industry and, under certain conditions, wild salmonids. Salmon lice originating from farms negatively impact wild stocks of salmonids, although the extent of the impact is a matter of debate. Estimates from Ireland and Norway indicate an odds ratio of 1.1:1-1.2:1 for sea lice treated Atlantic salmon smolt to survive sea migration compared to untreated smolts. This is considered to have a moderate population regulatory effect. The development of resistance against drugs most commonly used to treat salmon lice is a serious concern for both wild and farmed fish. Several large initiatives have been taken to encourage the development of new strategies, such as vaccines and novel drugs, for the treatment or removal of salmon lice from farmed fish. The newly sequenced salmon louse genome will be an important tool in this work. The use of cleaner fish has emerged as a robust method for controlling salmon lice, and aquaculture production of wrasse is important towards this aim. Salmon lice have large economic consequences for the salmon industry, both as direct costs for the prevention and treatment, but also indirectly through negative public opinion.

AB  - The Juan de Fuca eddy, located off the coasts of Washington (USA) and British Columbia (Canada), has been identified as a region that frequently contains relatively high levels of domoic acid (DA), a toxin produced by some members of the marine diatom genus, Pseudo-nitzschia. This seasonal eddy provides a unique environment to study the influence of nutrients on Pseudo-nitzschia abundance and DA accumulation in the field. Vertical sampling in the Juan de Fuca region was conducted in May, July and September of 2001 in an effort to determine environmental conditions and phytoplankton dynamics within the eddy compared to surrounding waters. The eddy was characterized by high primary productivity and high biomass in May and September relative to surrounding waters and was dominated by diatoms in the >5 μm size-fraction. In May, nitrate (NO 3 - ) concentrations and the corresponding NO 3 - assimilation rates by phytoplankton within the eddy surface waters were relatively low. In contrast, in September, NO 3 - was high and NO 3 - assimilation rates increased by 7 times relative to those in May. DA was below detection levels at all stations in May and July. In September, Pseudo-nitzschia reached highest cell densities (∼2 x 10 4 cells l -1 ) and particulate DA (∼30 ng DA equivalents l -1 ) was detected in surface waters of the eddy. The presence of DA in healthy growing phytoplankton communities indicates a need to examine other environmental conditions that induce DA production in natural Pseudo-nitzschia populations than have previously been reported in nutrient-stressed laboratory studies.

AB  - The sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi is a major threat to Chilean salmonid farming. Pyrethroids have been used for anticaligus treatments since 2007, but have shown reduced effect, most likely due to resistance development. Pyrethroid resistance is also a known problem in Lepeophtheirus salmonis in the Northern Hemisphere. This study describes the development of deltamethrin resistance in C. rogercresseyi based on bioassays and usage data for pyrethroids in Chilean aquaculture. These results were compared to bioassays from L. salmonis from Norway and to Norwegian usage data. Available deltamethrin bioassay results from 2007 and 2008, as well as bioassays from Norway, were collected and remodelled. Bioassays were performed on field-collected sea lice in region X in Chile in 2012 and 2013. Bioassays from 2007 were performed prior to the introduction of pyrethroids to the Chilean market. Both the results from 2008 and 2012 showed an increased resistance. Increased pyrethroid resistance was also indicated by the increased use of pyrethroids in Chilean aquaculture compared with the production of salmonids. A similar trend was seen in the Norwegian usage data. The bioassay results from Chile from 2012 and 2013 also indicated a difference in the susceptibility to deltamethrin between male and female caligus.

AB  - Since 1987, the use of antibacterial drugs in Norwegian fish farming has been drastically reduced from about 48 tonnes to approximately 1 tonne annually, varying slightly from year to year. The 649 kg active substance prescribed in 2007 corresponds to approximately 0.03% of the produced biomass being treated once with an antibacterial drug. This is an exceptional figure, particularly when compared with antibacterial drug use in terrestrial animal production or humans. It is therefore highly unlikely that this limited use of antibacterial drugs in farmed fish poses a significant risk to human medicine via the development of antibacterial drug resistance. Among the factors contributing to this favourable situation are: (a) a unique government–industry initiative adopted in the early 1990s to facilitate vaccination against classical furunculosis; (b) development of high-quality vaccines by the pharmaceutical industry; (c) the continuing predominance of vaccination strategies for disease control among fish farmers; (d) adoption of ‘all-in-all-out’ production systems, with mandatory fallowing periods between year classes; and (e) zoning and the spatial re-arrangement of marine production sites to minimize horizontal spread of infections. In Norway, targeted and flexible governance has allowed the rapid implementation of mass vaccination as well as zoo-sanitary measures. The limited use, however, also tends to limit the availability of licensed veterinary drugs in the marketplace. This creates a dilemma that should be addressed as a strategic issue for further long-term development of sustainable industrialized aquaculture.

AB  - In order to evaluate the present distribution patterns of salmonids and their potential effects on native fish, we sampled 11 large lakes and 105 streams, encompassing a total of 13 main hydrographic watersheds of southern Chile (39° to 52°S). Overall, trout (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss) accounted for more than 60 % of total fish abundance and more than 80 % of total biomass, while 40 % of the streams sampled did not have native fish. Salmon, introduced for aquaculture, such as O. kisutch, Salmo salar, and O. tshawytscha, were only present in lakes with salmon farming and did not seem to be reproducing naturally in affluent streams. We tested the effect of river geographic origin (Andes mountains, central valley, or Coastal range) on fish abundance and found that rainbow trout was more restricted to the Andean streams with higher water discharge, while brown trout was widely distributed and did not relate to any of several catchment attributes measured. The abundance of native fish was greater in lakes than in streams and the highest native fish biodiversity occurred in streams of the central valley. The most common native species were Galaxias maculatus, G. platei, Brachygalaxias bullocki, Aplochiton zebra and Basilichthys australis. Streams with higher conductivity, larger pool areas, more fine sediments, and low brown trout densities were more suitable for native fish. Thus, catchments with higher anthropogenic disturbance appeared as refuges for native species. Given the descriptive nature of our study we can only presume the negative impacts of trout and salmon on native fish; an effect which should be superimposed on biogeographical conditioning of present distribution. Yet based on the present abundance and distribution patterns of salmonids and native fish, negative effects are very likely. Conservation of native fish biodiversity in central valley streams, far from protected areas or national parks and fully exposed to human perturbations represents a great challenge. We propose to enhance conservation by exerting a stronger sport fishing pressure on trout in those streams

AB  - Although an increasing number of natural fish populations are being contaminated by exogenous immigrants, knowledge is poor regarding the genetic changes expected to occur in a wild stock once an introgression has taken place. One reason for this lack of knowledge appears to be that the theory for the genetic dynamics is poorly developed and complicated for age-structured populations with overlapping generations. Using newly developed theory and results from computer simulations, the genetic aspects of age-structured populations with overlapping generations are discussed, especially the detection of contamination and the genetic dynamics following hybridization. When generations overlap, the amount of temporal allele frequency shift is generally larger than for a population of equal genetically effective size with discrete generations. This is even more pronounced for the separate cohorts than for the population as a whole. Therefore, when testing for temporal genetic heterogeneity, a higher frequency of statistically significant results may be expected than can be explained by genetic drift caused by a restricted effective population size. During introgression, a sudden infusion of new genes initiates marked allele frequency fluctuations, and in salmonids this “genetic instability” may persist for several decades. In spite of these potentially dramatic fluctuations, even a massive influx of exogenous genes may be very difficult to detect, particularly in the absence of genetic and demographic monitoring data from the natural population prior to immigration. A conservative attitude is recommended when interpreting allele frequency differences within populations where the history and the demographic characteristics are poorly known. The risk of incorrect interpretations is particularly apparent for many salmonid species where only a subset of the existing age classes may be available for sampling.

AB  - This paper presents a validated protocol, using a novel, specifically formulated medium, to perform broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility assays of the salmonid bacterial pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for florfenicol and oxytetracycline against 58 P. salmonis isolates recovered from various outbreaks occurred in Chilean salmonid farms were determined using this protocol. Normalised resistance interpretation analysis was applied to these data to calculate appropriate protocol-specific epidemiological cut-off values. These cut-off values allow the isolates to be categorised as either fully susceptible wild type (WT) members of this species, or as manifesting reduced susceptibility non-wild type (NWT). The distribution of MIC values of florfenicol was bimodal and the distribution of the normalised values for the putative WT observation had a standard deviation of 0.896 log2 μg mL-1. This analysis calculated a cut-off value of ≤ 0.25 μg mL-1 and categorised 33 (56%) of the isolates as manifesting reduced susceptibility to florfenicol. For the oxytetracycline MIC data the normalised resistance interpretation analysis also treated the distribution as bimodal. The distribution of the normalised values for the putative WT observation had a standard deviation of 0.951 log2 μg mL-1. This analysis gave a cut-off value of ≤ 0.5 μg mL-1 and categorised 5 isolates (9%) as manifesting reduced susceptibility to oxytetracycline. The susceptibility testing protocol developed in this study was capable of generating MIC data from all the isolates tested. On the basis of the precision of the data it generated, and the degree of separation of values for WT and NWT it achieved, it is argued that this protocol has the performance characteristics necessary for it to be considered as a standard protocol.

AB  - Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is one of the most prevalent and economically devastating diseases in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming worldwide. The disease causes large mortalities at both the fry- and post-smolt stages. Family selection for increased IPN resistance is performed through the use of controlled challenge tests, where survival rates of sib-groups are recorded. However, since challenge-tested animals cannot be used as breeding candidates, within-family selection is not performed and only half of the genetic variation for IPN resistance is being exploited. DNA markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting IPN resistance would therefore be a powerful selection tool. The aim of this study was to identify and fine-map QTL for IPN-resistance in Atlantic salmon, for use in marker-assisted selection to increase the rate of genetic improvement for this trait. A genome scan was carried out using 10 large full-sib families of challenge-tested Atlantic salmon post-smolts and microsatellite markers distributed across the genome. One major QTL for IPN-resistance was detected, explaining 29% and 83% of the phenotypic and genetic variances, respectively. This QTL mapped to the same location as a QTL recently detected in a Scottish Atlantic salmon population. The QTL was found to be segregating in 10 out of 20 mapping parents, and subsequent fine-mapping with additional markers narrowed the QTL peak to a 4 cM region on linkage group 21. Challenge-tested fry were used to show that the QTL had the same effect on fry as on post-smolt, with the confidence interval for QTL position in fry overlapping the confidence interval found in post-smolts. A total of 178 parents were tested for segregation of the QTL, identifying 72 QTL-heterozygous parents. Genotypes at QTL-heterozygous parents were used to determine linkage phases between alleles at the underlying DNA polymorphism and alleles at single markers or multi-marker haplotypes. One four-marker haplotype was found to be the best predictor of QTL alleles, and was successfully used to deduce genotypes of the underlying polymorphism in 72% of the parents of the next generation within a breeding nucleus. A highly significant population-level correlation was found between deduced alleles at the underlying polymorphism and survival of offspring groups in the fry challenge test, parents with the three deduced genotypes (QQ, Qq, qq) having mean offspring mortality rates of 0.13, 0.32, and 0.49, respectively. The frequency of the high-resistance allele (Q) in the population was estimated to be 0.30. Apart from this major QTL, one other experiment-wise significant QTL for IPN-resistance was detected, located on linkage group 4. The QTL confirmed in this study represents a case of a major gene explaining the bulk of genetic variation for a presumed complex trait. QTL genotypes were deduced within most parents of the 2005 generation of a major breeding company, providing a solid framework for linkage-based MAS within the whole population in subsequent generations. Since haplotype-trait associations valid at the population level were found, there is also a potential for MAS based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). However, in order to use MAS across many generations without reassessment of linkage phases between markers and the underlying polymorphism, the QTL needs to be positioned with even greater accuracy. This will require higher marker densities than are currently available.

AB  - Initially the major emphasis of this legislation was to protect owners of cats and dogs from the theft of their animals, many of which were found to be sold for experimental purposes. The 1970 amendments broadened the coverage to include all species of animals, not just cats and dogs, and to include animals which are pets or are used for exhibition purposes. These amendments, as did the amendments of 1976, gave added emphasis to the recognition of the sale, purchase, transportation, housing, care, handling and treatment of animals used for research purposes, or as pets or for exhibitions, as a significantly large interstate commercial operation. There was a need to insure humane care and treatment of these animals.

AB  - Abstract  Isomeric ratios of astaxanthin in eggs and alevins of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., have proven useful in identifying female spawners of farmed origin, but the method underestimates the proportion of fish of farmed origin. The rate of underestimation was studied by analysing astaxanthin content in tissue of 55 farmed Atlantic salmon ascending two Norwegian rivers in the autumn of 1991. The astaxanthin content fell into two distinct classes. Fifty-one per cent of the adult escaped salmon had isomeric ratios similar to salmon fed synthetic astaxanthin, whereas all the remaining fish had ratios similar to wild fish. Discriminant analysis classified 96.4% of the fish with known astaxanthin content into the correct astaxanthin class on basis of tail-fin erosion, length, weight and gill-cover damage. This discriminant function was used to estimate the astaxanthin classification of 1017 farmed salmon caught in nine rivers during 1989–1991. The classification success varied among years from 52 to 64%. Corresponding numbers for females and males were 45–48% and 54–70%, respectively. Thus, estimates of spawning rates of farmed female salmon via astaxanthin content in eggs or alevins from redds should be adjusted accordingly. The observed isomeric ratios of astaxanthin in the escaped farmed salmon and the relationship with morphology indicates that a significant proportion of the escapees ascending rivers have spent more than 1 year in the wild after escape.

AB  - We study the development of aquaculture activities in Chile and the impacts of regulatory changes on location decision for aquaculture production centers. Our study considers a descriptive analysis on the spatial and temporal development of aquaculture production centers. Next, using a panel data we estimate a site selection model to explore determinant factors of site choices for aquaculture production. Our results suggest a clear pattern for the spatial-temporal development of Chilean aquaculture. The pattern is characterized by a movement of the production centers towards the south of Chilean Patagonia, changing the concentration of the production activities from Puerto Montt to the southern region of Chiloe Island. The estimation of a model of site selection suggests that the distance between production centers and the presence of centers devoted to the production of the same species are relevant in explaining the movement of the production activities towards the southern region. The regulatory changes seem to be important determinant factors for the observed spatial and temporal pattern of development of the aquaculture industry in the country.

AB  - Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade-offs, frequency dependence resulting from species-specific pests, re- cruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation- extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community-level patterns. We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model com- munities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across com- munities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative- abundance distributions are more even for systems with compet- itive differences and trade-offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when fre- quency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed sur- prisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of com- munity-level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, pa- rameterization of models such as these from field data on the

AB  - Antibiotics have been extensively used against infections produced by Piscirickettsia salmonis, a fish pathogen and causative agent of piscirickettsiosis and one of the major concerns for the Chilean salmon industry. Therefore, the emergence of resistant phenotypes is to be expected. With the aim of obtaining a landscape of the antimicrobial resistance of P. salmonis in Chile, the susceptibility profiles for quinolones, florfenicol and oxytetracycline (OTC) of 292 field isolates derived from main rearing areas, different hosts and collected over 5 years were assessed. The results allowed for the determination of epidemiological cut-off values that were used to characterize the pathogen population. This work represents the first large-scale field study addressing the antimicrobial susceptibility of P. salmonis, providing evidence of the existence of resistant types with a high incidence of resistance to quinolones. Remarkably, despite the amounts and frequency of therapies, our results disclosed that the issue of resistance to florfenicol and OTC is still in the onset.

AB  - The practical difficulties in measuring the prevalence, incidence, and pathogenicity of diseases in wild Atlantic salmon populations cause serious problems in determining the possible implications of disease. Limited research has been undertaken on wild salmon disease associated with environmental effects of fish farming, or with the disease implications of possible changes to the genetic make-up of wild salmonid stocks as a consequence of farmed fish escaping. To date, no significant disease problems have been reported linked to these aspects. The greatest disease risk to both farmed and wild stocks is through the introduction of exotic pathogens into areas where local stocks have no innate resistance. National and international legislative controls are in existence to reduce this risk, but these have not afforded total protection. Serious epizootics of furunculosis and Gyrodactylus salaris in stocks of salmon indicate the severe consequences of new disease outbreaks linked to movements of live fish for farming or restocking purposes. A wide range of infectious agents has been recorded from wild salmon and some of these (and from other species of wild fish) provide the primary source of infection leading to disease problems in fish farms. Although disease control has markedly improved in fish farms in recent years, problems still remain with some diseases, notably sea lice. It is likely that the lice population and other diseases in farms contribute infection to local wild stocks, but the extent and consequences of this have not been quantified.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between social interactions, brain serotonergic activity, and two behavioural patterns in juvenile Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus): feeding and spontaneous swimming activity. Dominant and subordinate individuals were observed during rearing in pairs, followed by rearing in isolation. Throughout the experiment, levels of both food intake and swimming activity remained high in dominant fish. When they were in pairs, food intake was completely inhibited in subordinate fish; thus, dominant fish were able to monopolise food. At the same time, brain serotonergic activity, as indexed by the ratio of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) was elevated in the hypothalamus and brain stem of subordinate fish compared with dominants. During subsequent rearing in isolation, food intake, but not spontaneous locomotor activity, gradually increased in previously subordinate fish, while serotonergic activity fell to near that of dominants. Thus, appetite inhibition in subordinate fish can be reversed by rearing in isolation, an effect that may be related to the reversal of a stress-induced activation of brain serotonergic neurones accompanying social subordination. Reduced swimming activity is either a long-lasting response to social subordination or reflects permanently different behavioural strategies of subordinate and dominant individuals. Resume : Nous avons etudie la relation entre les interactions sociales, l'activite serotonergique du cerveau et deux types d'activite, l'alimentation et la nage spontanee, chez des Ombles chevaliers ( Salvelinus alpinus) juveniles. Des individus dominants et subordonnes ont ete observes, d'abord en groupes de deux, puis isoles. Pendant toute la duree de l'experience, les deux genres d'activite ont ete intenses chez les individus dominants. Lorsque les poissons etaient en groupes de deux, l'alimentation etait completement inhibee chez les poissons subordonnes et le poisson dominant avait alors le monopole de la nourriture. Pendant ce temps, l'activite serotonergique du cerveau, telle qu'evaluee par le rapport entre l'acide hydroxy-5-indoleacetique (5-HIAA) et la serotonine (hydroxy-5 tryptamine, 5-HT) etait elevee dans l'hypothalamus et le pedoncule cervical des poissons subordonnes comparativement a celle enregistree chez les poissons dominants. Apres l'isolement des poissons, l'alimentation, mais pas l'activite locomotrice spontanee, a augmente graduellement chez les poissons subordonnes et l'activite serotonergique de ces poissons est redevenue semblable a celle des poissons dominants. L'inhibition de l'appetit chez les poissons subordonnes peut donc etre inversee par l'isolement des poissons, sans doute par renversement de l'activation des neurones serotonergiques sous l'action du stress qui accompagne la subordination sociale. La diminution de l'activite natatoire peut etre interpretee comme une reaction de longue duree a la subordination sociale, ou alors elle reflete les strategies comportementales differentes qui prevalent en permanence chez les poissons dominants et les poissons subordonnes.

AB  - Status-based differences in sclera colour in small groups of juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, held in a semi-natural environment over a 20 day period, became obvious 3 days after the start of the study and persisted for the 20 days. Dominant fish had pale sclera, and this pattern was very stable over the experimental period. In contrast, the sclera colour of subordinate fish (ranks 2-5) fluctuated from day to day. Median sclera colour of fish ranked 4--5 darkened on days they received more aggression, and sclera of rank 2 fish were lighter on days on which they initiated more attacks. Changes in sclera colour of fish ranked 2-4 were more frequent during feeding periods than non-feeding periods. This study confirms that the relationship between eye colour and status described in tanks is also seen in more natural environments, and also that colour change in juvenile salmonids is a complex response to local events.

AB  - People who are food and nutrition insecure largely reside in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa and for many, fish represents a rich source of protein, micronutrients and essential fatty acids. The contribution of fish to household food and nutrition security depends upon availability, access and cultural and personal preferences. Access is largely determined by location, seasonality and price but at the individual level it also depends upon a person's physiological and health status and how fish is prepared, cooked and shared among household members. The sustained and rapid expansion of aquaculture over the past 30 years has resulted in >40% of all fish now consumed being derived from farming. While aquaculture produce increasingly features in the diets of many Asians, it is much less apparent among those living in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here, per capita fish consumption has grown little and despite the apparently strong markets and adequate biophysical conditions, aquaculture has yet to develop. The contribution of aquaculture to food and nutrition security is not only just an issue of where aquaculture occurs but also of what is being produced and how and whether the produce is as accessible as that from capture fisheries. The range of fish species produced by an increasingly globalized aquaculture industry differs from that derived from capture fisheries. Farmed fishes are also different in terms of their nutrient content, a result of the species being grown and of rearing methods. Farmed fish price affects access by poor consumers while the size at which fish is harvested influences both access and use. This paper explores these issues with particular reference to Asia and Africa and the technical and policy innovations needed to ensure that fish farming is able to fulfil its potential to meet the global population's food and nutrition needs.

AB  - The continuing decline of ocean fisheries and rise of global fish consumption has driven aquaculture growth by 10% annually over the last decade. The association of fish farms with disease emergence in sympatric wild fish stocks remains one of the most controversial and unresolved threats aquaculture poses to coastal ecosystems and fisheries. We report a comprehensive analysis of the spread and impact of farm-origin parasites on the survival of wild fish populations. We mathematically coupled extensive data sets of native parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) transmission and pathogenicity on migratory wild juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon. Farm-origin lice induced 9-95% mortality in several sympatric wild juvenile pink and chum salmon populations. The epizootics arise through a mechanism that is new to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases: fish farms undermine a functional role of host migration in protecting juvenile hosts from parasites associated with adult hosts. Although the migratory life cycles of Pacific salmon naturally separate adults from juveniles, fish farms provide L. salmonis novel access to juvenile hosts, in this case raising infection rates for at least the first approximately 2.5 months of the salmon's marine life (approximately 80 km of the migration route). Spatial segregation between juveniles and adults is common among temperate marine fishes, and as aquaculture continues its rapid growth, this disease mechanism may challenge the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and economies.

AB  - In this paper we use the global commodity chain perspective to analyse the Chilean salmon farming industry. This industry reflects current shifts in the global agro-food sector in that food distribution and retail sectors assume a significant role at the ‘back-end’ of the farmed salmon global commodity chain. Economic concentration is also occurring along the ‘front-end’ of the chain; foreign fish feed capital is integrating forwards into production and thereby assuming greater influence. This is matched by greater economic concentration by foreign and local salmon farming companies in the middle of the chain. Local capital is meeting the challenge of foreign capital by using flexible strategies in the service sector of the salmon farming industry. We also discuss the impact of the farmed salmon global commodity chain on class and gender relations at the point of production. In our conclusions, we discuss the limitations of the global commodity chain perspective as well as the consequences of salmon farming for livelihoods in rural Chile.

AB  - RESUMEN Se identificaron las areas de uso y conflicto entre la salmonicultura y el turismo en el area preandina de la Region de La Araucania en Chile. Para ello se determinaron variables de aptitud y de restricciones tecnicas y legales que se integraron a traves de un Sistema de Informacion Geografica. Posteriormente, se evaluo la percepcion de actores comunales frente a los dos tipos de actividades. Los resultados permitieron identificar tres sectores de conflicto espacial, todos en la comuna de Pucon. Se cuantificaron 245.113 ha potenciales de aptitud para la instalacion de centros de cultivos de salmonideos. Sin embargo, el estudio de percepcion mostro que un amplio sector es renuente a la instalacion de nuevos centros de cultivo. Por su parte, el turismo se percibe como una actividad que genera mayor empleabilidad en el sector, pero no es claro para la poblacion los efectos ambientales de ambas actividades. Palabras clave: Planificacion territorial, conflicto de uso, acuicultura, turismo, percepcion.

AB  - Abstract Protection from communicable diseases of salmonid fishes is an important component of fisheries management strategy; experiences in Canada over the past two decades are presented. A comprehensive range of measures was developed to protect the health of salmon and trout resources by minimizing the risk of introducing and disseminating communicable diseases. These measures affect both wild resources and aquaculturc operations. They include national regulations. provincial and regional fish health protection initiatives, and control of potential hazards related to use of live fish for research, manufacture of feeds, importation and production of biologics, and use of drugs and therapeutics. A strengthened research and development capability supported technological innovation and provided the basis for refining regulations and policies. Programs for training and skill development in the prevention, control, and treatment of fish diseases were also expanded. This integrated strategy created a favorabl...

AB  - Climate–ocean regimes in the north-east Pacific translate into decadal-scale patterns in the relative success of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). By combining estimates of year class abundance determined from commercial catches and research surveys for adults and juveniles, we were able to construct an index of year class success. Year classes from 1960 to 1976 were generally below average, with little indication of good year class success. The 1977 year class was exceptionally large and year classes from 1978 to 1990 were generally above average. Year classes following 1990 were generally below average. The periods with above-average year classes were generally characterized by intense Aleutian Lows, above-average frequency of south-westerly winds and warmer coastal sea surface temperatures off the west coast of Vancouver Island. Decadal-scale patterns in the production of sablefish suggest stability in long-term periods of similar recruitment but different mean levels of productivity across periods. However, rapid shifts between periods remain unpredictable and therefore complicate the incorporation of decadal-scale dynamics in management.

AB  - Abstract Environmental issues have been of central importance throughout the history of salmon aquacuiture in Norway. In this paper we will examine some of the issues, and show that while there are still problems, many have also been resolved. A major reason for this is the fact that salmon farmers have internalized many of the environmental effects into their decision‐making due to the relationship between environmental impact and productivity. Another reason, particularly when it comes to treatment of diseases, is that lack of private innovative activity due to different market failures has been compensated for by government‐sponsored research and development.

AB  - The production characteristics of shrimp farming in Bangladesh are reported based on a panel of farms for the period 1998 to 2002. The data allow for a profit decomposition based on the Tornqvist index, where differences in relative profits can be explained by differences in productivity, prices, and pond size. The indices indicate that pond size is the most important factor in determining profitability and that the largest farms are the most profitable. However, productivity measured as profit per hectare is only weakly positively correlated with pond size. In fact, the smallest ponds rely more on productivity in generating profit relative to the most profitable farm. These results indicate that small farms are disadvantaged not because they lack the skills to manage, but because the farms are too small. The challenge for Bangladeshi policy makers is to devise methods and procedures to allow small farmers to expand pond size.

It then goes on to describe an approach for estimating the current combined biophysical resource demands of aquaculture for producer countries and regions. Following a comparison of these results with those available for other animal food production sectors the report then examines the consequences of likely future trends in production on the environmental impacts of aquaculture. Finally, the policy implications of the reportA†s findings are discussed along with the research agenda that should be pursued to meet the challenge of sustainable food production.

AB  - Summary Soybeans represent a recent and powerful threat to tropical biodiversity in Brazil. Developing effective strategies to contain and minimize the environmental impact of soybean cultivation requires understanding of both the forces that drive the soybean advance and the many ways that soybeans and their associated infrastructure catalyse destructive processes. The present paper presents an up-to-date review of the advance of soybeans in Brazil, its environmental and social costs and implications for development policy. Soybeans are driven by global market forces, making them different from many of the land-use changes that have dominated the scene in Brazil so far, particularly in Amazonia. Soybeans are much more damaging than other crops because they justify massive transportation infrastructure projects that unleash a chain of events leading to destruction of natural habitats over wide areas in addition to what is directly cultivated for soybeans. The capacity of global markets to absorb additional production represents the most likely limit to the spread of soybeans, although Brazil may someday come to see the need for discouraging rather than subsidizing this crop because many of its effects are unfavourable to national interests, including severe concentration of land tenure and income, expulsion of population to Amazonian frontier, and gold-mining, as well as urban areas, and the opportunity cost of substantial drains on government resources. The multiple impacts of soybean expansion on biodiversity and other development considerations have several implications for policy: (1) protected areas need to be created in advance of soybean frontiers, (2) elimination of the many subsidies that speed soybean expansion beyond what would occur otherwise from market forces is to be encouraged, (3) studies to assess the costs of social and environmental impacts associated with soybean expansion are urgently required, and (4) the environmental-impact regulatory system requires strengthening, including mechanisms for commitments not to implant specific infrastructure projects that are judged to have excessive impacts.

AB  - Rates of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria have increased precipitously over the past several decades, with far-reaching healthcare and societal costs. Recent evidence has established a link between antibiotic resistance genes in human pathogens and those found in non-pathogenic, commensal, and environmental organisms, prompting deeper investigation of natural and human-associated reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. Functional metagenomic selections, in which shotgun-cloned DNA fragments are selected for their ability to confer survival to an indicator host, have been increasingly applied to the characterization of many antibiotic resistance reservoirs. These experiments have demonstrated that antibiotic resistance genes are highly diverse and widely distributed, many times bearing little to no similarity to known sequences. Through unbiased selections for survival to antibiotic exposure, functional metagenomics can improve annotations by reducing the discovery of false-positive resistance and by allowing for the identification of previously unrecognizable resistance genes. In this review, we summarize the novel resistance functions uncovered using functional metagenomic investigations of natural and human-impacted resistance reservoirs. Examples of novel antibiotic resistance genes include those highly divergent from known sequences, those for which sequence is entirely unable to predict resistance function, bifunctional resistance genes, and those with unconventional, atypical resistance mechanisms. Overcoming antibiotic resistance in the clinic will require a better understanding of existing resistance reservoirs and the dissemination networks that govern horizontal gene exchange, informing best practices to limit the spread of resistance-conferring genes to human pathogens.

AB  - Background
Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) is a pathogen of marine-farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar); a disease first diagnosed in Norway in 1984. For over 25 years ISAV has caused major disease outbreaks in the Northern hemisphere, and remains an emerging fish pathogen because of the asymptomatic infections in marine wild fish and the potential for emergence of new epidemic strains. ISAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, together with influenza viruses but is sufficiently different to be assigned to its own genus, Isavirus. The Isavirus genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA species, and the virions have two surface glycoproteins; fusion (F) protein encoded on segment 5 and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein encoded on segment 6. However, comparision between different ISAV isolates is complicated because there is presently no universally accepted nomenclature system for designation of genetic relatedness between ISAV isolates. The first outbreak of ISA in marine-farmed Atlantic salmon in the Southern hemisphere occurred in Chile starting in June 2007. In order to describe the molecular characteristics of the virus so as to understand its origins, how ISAV isolates are maintained and spread, and their virulence characteristics, we conducted a study where the viral sequences were directly amplified, cloned and sequenced from tissue samples collected from several ISA-affected fish on the different fish farms with confirmed or suspected ISA outbreaks in Chile. This paper describes the genetic characterization of a large number of ISAV strains associated with extensive outbreaks in Chile starting in June 2007, and their phylogenetic relationships with selected European and North American isolates that are representative of the genetic diversity of ISAV.

AB  - The first catches of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in British Columbia (BC) waters occurred in 1987. The first reported escape of Atlantic salmon (2000 individuals) occurred in 1988. From 1988 to 1995, 97 799 Atlantic salmon were reported escaped from net pens in BC but the true number was higher as not all escapes are reported. Since 1987 a total of 9096 Atlantic salmon was caught in the coastal marine waters of BC, Washington and Alaska, and 188 were caught in fresh water. Most catches occurred in the Johnstone Strait area, where the abundance of salmon farms is highest. The most distant recovery occurred in 1994 when an Atlantic salmon was caught near the western end of the Alaska Peninsula. There have been no reports of successful reproduction of Atlantic salmon in the wild and no feral juveniles have been found. Atlantic salmon caught in the ocean in BC have substantial amounts of adipose tissue and they are heavier at length than fish caught in Alaska. The proportion of fish with prey items in their stomachs is generally low but higher in Alaska (13.1%) than in BC (5.8%). Most fish caught in fresh water are either maturing or mature.

AB  - According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, aquaculture is growing more rapidly than all other animal food-production sectors (www.fao.org). Its contribution to global supplies of several species of fish, crustaceans and mollusks increased from 3.9% of total production by weight in 1970 to 33% in 2005. It has been estimated that fisheries and aquaculture supplied the world with about 110 million metric tons of food fish per year (FAO, State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2010.), providing a per capita supply of 16.7 kg (live weight equivalent). Of this supply, 47% is derived from aquaculture production. However, this production is hampered by unpredictable mortalities that may be due to negative interactions between fish and pathogenic bacteria. To solve this problem, farmers frequently use antibiotic compounds to treat bacterial diseases (Cabello 2006).

AB  - In Norway, there have been restrictions on salmon farming in several fjords to reduce the potential negative impact on important stocks of wild Atlantic salmon. Little is known about the incidence of escaped farmed salmon in fisheries and broodstocks relative to the extent of fish farming in nearby areas. In this study, we analysed data on the incidence of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon in angling catches and broodstock fisheries in rivers for a 16-year period (1989e2004). These data were weighted using official catch statistics and combined at the county level, and the incidence of escapees was correlated with both the stock of farmed salmon in net pens and the reported number of escapees in different Norwegian counties. Our results indicate a significant positive correlation between the incidence of escaped farmed salmon in the rivers at the county level and the intensity of salmon farming, measured as the number of farmed salmon in net pens, suggesting that protection areas may reduce the impact of escapees in salmon populations nearby.

AB  - The effect of a shielding skirt, a tarpaulin mounted from the surface down to 5 meter depth around a net cage, on the flow pattern at a commercially stocked salmon cage was investigated. Dye was used as a tracer for water movement and the dye spreading was monitored using aerial images. Current meters were employed to investigate the flow close to the net inside and outside the cage. Tests were conducted with and without the shielding skirt. The focus was on the effectiveness of the shielding skirt to deflect water around the cage. This study shows that a shielding skirt can reduce horizontal flow components significantly inside a cage, which is related to a reduction of water exchange. The flow towards a cage is divided by a shielding skirt, i.e. some of the water is transported around the cage, while some is passing underneath the shielding skirt. Some water entering the fish cage from underneath the tarpaulin is transported towards the surface inside the cage. The use of a shielding skirt might not prevent interaction of the upper water layers inside and outside of a fish cage completely, but it has the potential to reduce the inflow of surface water into the cage, if deployed properly.Copyright © 2013 by ASME

AB  - Apex marine predators alter their foraging behavior in response to spatial and/or seasonal changes in natural prey distribution and abundance. However, few studies have identified the impacts of aquaculture that represents a spatially and temporally predictable and abundant resource on their foraging behavior. Using satellite telemetry and stable isotope analysis we examined the degree of spatial overlap between the South American sea lion (SASL) and salmon farms, and quantify the amount of native prey versus farmed salmonids in SASL diets. We instrumented eight SASL individuals with SRDL-GPS tags. Vibrissae, hair and skin samples were collected for δ13C and δ15N analyses from five of the tagged individuals and from four males captured in a haul-out located adjacent to salmon farms. Tracking results showed that almost all the foraging areas of SASL are within close proximity to salmon farms. The most important prey for the individuals analyzed was farmed salmonids, with an estimated median (±SD) contribution of 19.7 ± 13.5‰ and 15.3 ± 9.6‰ for hair and skin, respectively. Using vibrissae as a temporal record of diet for each individual, we observed a remarkable switch in diet composition in two SASL, from farmed salmonids to pelagic fishes, which coincided with the decrease of salmon production due to the infectious salmon anemia virus that affected salmon farms in Chile at the end of 2008. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of integrating stable isotope derived dietary data with movement patterns to characterize the impacts of a non-native prey on the foraging ecology of an apex marine predator, providing important applied implications in situations where interactions between aquaculture and wildlife are common.

AB  - Exotic salmonids were deliberately introduced to the southern hemisphere during the last part of the 20th century, initially to boost sport fishing and later to develop an aquaculture industry. Early introductions were justified by governments on purely utilitarian arguments as it was felt that translocated salmonids would capitalize on otherwise ‘underutilized’ aquatic niches. A century later, exotic salmonids are established in nearly all places where they were originally introduced and beyond, and constitute one of the main threats to endemic fish fauna, amongst which galaxiid fishes have perhaps been impacted the most. We screened the literature to document the changing perspectives on exotic salmonids in the southern hemisphere, and employed SWOT analysis to assess the conservation prognosis of native galaxiids in the face of salmonid invasions. Our analysis indicates that opinions differ and contradictions abound as to how to prevent further salmonid encroachment. This is largely due to lack of info...

AB  - Aquaculture is a growing and high-value industry that depends on access to and wise use of shared inland, coastal and marine resources. Varied stakeholders and communities are very interested in these public resources, and there has been conflict about how the aquaculture industry uses them. Prior to the research discussed in this article, there have been few large-scale studies of community perceptions of aquaculture. Our research drew upon an extensive literature review, stakeholder interviews and a survey mailed to the public in two regional case studies in Australia: the Eyre Peninsula in the state of South Australia and Port Phillip Bay in the state of Victoria. The data revealed some public support for aquaculture’s socioeconomic benefits and strong interest in minimizing the risk of its environmental impacts. There were mixed opinions about the trustworthiness of governments’ aquaculture decisions and actions. Some industry sectors attracted greater trust and lower perceived environmental risks. The importance and credibility of different information sources varied. There was strong support for improved dialogue among governments, the aquaculture industry and communities. Key differences between the regions included levels of awareness of and knowledge about aquaculture. Our research is consistent with literature on risk communication and perception that suggests that conflict and subsequent costs to industry and the community can be overcome or mitigated if government and industry understand, acknowledge and respond to community perceptions of the industry.

AB  - Continuing population and consumption growth will mean that the global demand for food will increase for at least another 40 years. Growing competition for land, water, and energy, in addition to the overexploitation of fisheries, will affect our ability to produce food, as will the urgent requirement to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. The effects of climate change are a further threat. But the world can produce more food and can ensure that it is used more efficiently and equitably. A multifaceted and linked global strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable food security, different components of which are explored here.

AB  - We examined genetic differences in the reproduction of an alternative maturation phenotype in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by comparing the spawning behaviour and success among farmed, first-generation hybrid, and wild mature male parr raised in similar environments. Parr competed for spawning opportunities in the presence of ei- ther wild or farmed large males. There were no consistent differences among groups in aggression; however, there were differences in spawning participation with respect to large male origin and among parr types. There was a strong nega- tive temporal effect on mature male parr spawning participation that differed by parr type; wild and farmed parr were most likely to participate in early spawnings, with hybrids being the most likely to participate in late spawnings. Over- all, parr were also less likely to participate in spawnings involving large farmed males. Variance in reproductive suc- cess was higher among parr than among large males. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that there are genetically based behavioural differences among mature male parr of farmed and wild origin that may potentially lead to differences in reproductive success.

AB  - This paper analyzes the existence of learning-by-doing and technological leapfrogging effects in Norwegian salmon aquaculture. The salmon industry has experienced rapid technological progress and productivity growth over recent decades. Firms entering innovative industries may be able to leapfrog incumbent firms by bypassing heavy investments in older technologies, and taking advantage of best-practice technology that was previously unavailable. An alternative hypothesis that explains different productivity levels is the learning-by-doing hypothesis, where incumbent firms benefit from more experience. A stochastic production frontier model was estimated on a large panel of firms. Our results suggest that entering firms aged 3 to 5 years perform slightly better than older firms with respect to technical efficiency, and thereby support the technological leapfrogging hypothesis. This may indicate that entering firms take advantage of improved technologies compared with incumbent firms with older capital vint...

AB  - The economic weights derived from profit equations depend on the base used for the evaluation. Thus different relative economic weights are obtained per unit of investment, per breeding female, per individual or per unit of product. This has led to uncertainty and confusion about appropriate economic weights in livestock improvement, and to apparent differences in interests between the investor, the farmer and the consumer. It is shown here that if the profit equation has a zero outcome, or the profit equation is transformed by setting its outcome to zero by considering profit as a cost of production (so called ‘normal profit’ in economics), then the relative economic weights are the same for all bases of evaluation. It is argued that this is the appropriate basis to determine economic weights.

AB  - In the 1970s several reports of drug resistance in fish pathogens from Japanese fish farms linked antibiotic resistance to fish farming. In this report, the devastating effect of acquired sulfonamide resistance in the treatment of furunculosis was demonstrated in clinical trials. A. salmonicida strains from Norway, including 10 isolates of sulfonamide-resistant atypical strains representing the various groups of a typical A. salmonicida isolated in Norway, were screened for occurrence of class 1 integrons and sulfonamide resistance genes. In this study A. salmonicida isolates from Switzerland, Finland, France, Japan, Scotland, and the United States were also studied. The study also characterized a third R plasmid of about 70 kb found in two A. hydrophila isolates in 1974 in the United States. It is also of particular interest that one of the R plasmids of E. tarda is very similar to the R plasmids of P. damselae subsp. piscicida. Infections with multiple-drug-resistant V. anguillarum occurred in farmed ayu in Japan in 1973. Several studies demonstrate transfer of R plasmids from fish pathogens to E. coli recipients. In many ways, fish pathogens represent possible intermediate vectors for shipping antibiotic resistance genes between the environment and human beings for further recombination.

AB  - The generalised demand specification of Barten and Eales et al. is used to estimate the world demand curves faced by major exporters of farmed salmon. Results suggest that the demand for farmed salmon has become less price elastic over time, fresh salmon from the UK faces the most competition in world markets and fresh salmon from Chile the least. Promotion programmes sponsored by the Norwegian Seafood Export Council appear to have increased the demand for fresh salmon at the expense of frozen salmon. Although the estimated promotion effects are small, the programme appears to have been remunerative from the Norwegian producer perspective.

AB  - Global seafood provides almost 20% of all animal protein in diets, and aquaculture is, despite weakening trends, the fastest growing food sector worldwide. Recent increases in production have largely been achieved through intensification of existing farming systems, resulting in higher risks of disease outbreaks. This has led to increased use of antimicrobials (AMs) and consequent antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in many farming sectors, which may compromise the treatment of bacterial infections in the aquaculture species itself and increase the risks of AMR in humans through zoonotic diseases or through the transfer of AMR genes to human bacteria. Multiple stakeholders have, as a result, criticized the aquaculture industry, resulting in consequent regulations in some countries. AM use in aquaculture differs from that in livestock farming due to aquaculture’s greater diversity of species and farming systems, alternative means of AM application, and less consolidated farming practices in many regions. This, together with less research on AM use in aquaculture in general, suggests that large data gaps persist with regards to its overall use, breakdowns by species and system, and how AMs become distributed in, and impact on, the overall social-ecological systems in which they are embedded. This paper identifies the main factors (and challenges) behind application rates, which enables discussion of mitigation pathways. From a set of identified key mechanisms for AM usage, six proximate factors are identified: vulnerability to bacterial disease, AM access, disease diagnostic capacity, AMR, target markets and food safety regulations, and certification. Building upon these can enable local governments to reduce AM use through farmer training, spatial planning, assistance with disease identification, and stricter regulations. National governments and international organizations could, in turn, assist with disease-free juveniles and vaccines, enforce rigid monitoring of the quantity and quality of AMs used by farmers and the AM residues in the farmed species and in the environment, and promote measures to reduce potential human health risks associated with AMR.

AB  - Abstract Amoebic gill disease (AGD) and sea lice are two of the most significant disease issues that the Norwegian Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry is facing. Although both diseases respond to various extents, to freshwater treatment, the chemistry, interactions, and efficacy of treatment can be variable. These variations can have significant impacts upon the success and failure of treatment and costs to the production cycle. Although it is known that soft freshwater is most effective in bathing of Atlantic salmon with AGD and that most of the freshwaters in Norway fall into the soft category, the low alkalinity and buffering capacity of such waters may impact on the pH and metal toxicity of the water source in use. Similarly dissolved organic carbon can be beneficial in treatment, although sequestration of metal ions can be reversed as the water pH drops due to high densities of fish and accumulations of carbon dioxide. Alternative treatments such as the use of oxidative disinfectants such as hydrogen peroxide used for AGD and sea lice control may have potential although the interactions in seawater with organic loads and dissolved organic carbon are unclear. Similarly the use of oxidative disinfectants in freshwater will depend upon the water chemistry and interactions with treatment chemicals, fish, and water organic content. The logistics of treating large biomasses of Atlantic salmon on marine farms are challenging. The use of well boats offers potential although maintaining water quality during treatments is essential for both AGD and sea lice treatments to optimize fish welfare and treatment efficacy.

AB  - The rapid expansion of the salmon aquaculture industry in the last decade and the intentional and unintentional use of many chemicals have resulted in wastes that may have a direct environmental impact. Thus, methods and criteria are required to assess the environmental impact of these chemicals, in particular to identify the hazards and assess the risks of their uses. We describe a project in progress that is aimed at identifying the source of chemical wastes of salmon aquaculture in the Bay of Fundy, the quantities released, their distribution, and environmental fate. The project is also concerned with the effects of chemical wastes on important fisheries resources. Laboratory studies indicated that chemicals used in the treatment of sea-lice infestations are lethal to shrimp and lobsters. Lobsters exposed to sublethal concentrations of one of these chemicals, azamethipohos, had decreased reproductive success compared to control lobsters. However, more information is required to estimate the associated risk to wild populations of lobster and shrimp.

AB  - Piscirickettsia salmonis is the pathogen causing Piscirickettsiosis. For treatment, the industry mainly uses oxytetracycline and florfenicol, so it is essential to understand the degree of susceptibility of this pathogen to these drugs. But this is still unknown for a large number of P. salmonis strains, as are the molecular mechanisms responsible for greater or lesser susceptibility. However, genes that confer resistance to these antimicrobials have been reported and characterized for this and other bacterial species, among which are membrane proteins that take out the drug. Our results identified differences in the degree of susceptibility to both antibiotics among different Chilean isolated of these bacteria. We analysed 10 available genomes in our laboratory and identified ~140 genes likely to be involved in antibiotic resistance. We analysed six specific genes, which suggests that some of them would eventually be relevant in conferring resistance to both antibiotics, as they encode for specific transporter proteins, which increase the number of transcripts when grown in media with these antibiotics. Our results were corroborated with EtBr permeability analysis, which revealed that the LF-89 strain accumulates this compound and has a reduced capacity to expulse it compared with the field strains.

AB  - The Chilean salmon industry has undergone a rapid development making the country the world's second largest producer of farmed salmon, but this growth has been accompanied by an intensive use of antibiotics. This overuse has become so significant that Chilean salmon aquaculture currently has one of the highest rates of antibiotic consumption per ton of harvested fish in the world. This review has focused on discussing use of antibiotics and current status of scientific knowledge regarding to incidence of antimicrobial resistance and associated genes in the Chilean salmonid farms. Over recent years there has been a consistent increase in the amount of antimicrobials used by Chilean salmonid farms, from 143.2 tons in 2010 to 382.5 tons in 2016. During 2016, Chilean companies utilized approximately 0.53 kg of antibiotics per ton of harvested salmon, 363.4 tons (95%) were used in marine farms, and 19.1 tons (5%) in freshwater farms dedicated to smolt production. Florfenicol and oxytetracycline were by far the most frequently used antibiotics during 2016 (82.5 and 16.8%, respectively), mainly being used to treat Piscirickettsia salmonis, currently considered the main bacterial threat to this industry. However, the increasing development of this industry in Chile, as well as the intensive use of antimicrobials, has not been accompanied by the necessary scientific research needed to understand the impact of the intensive use of antibiotics in this industry. Over the last two decades several studies assessing antimicrobial resistance and the resistome in the freshwater and marine environment impacted by salmon farming have been conducted, but information on the ecological and environmental consequences of antibiotic use in fish farming is still scarce. In addition, studies reporting the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens, mainly P. salmonis, have been developed, but a high number of these studies were aimed at setting their epidemiological cut-off values. In conclusion, further studies are urgently required, mainly focused on understanding the evolution and epidemiology of resistance genes in Chilean salmonid farming, and to investigate the feasibility of a link between these genes among bacteria from salmonid farms and human and fish pathogens.

AB  - The genetic response of Atlantic salmon to culture is important in predicting the success of these fish in nature and their impacts on wild populations through competition and interbreeding. We compared a seventh-generation strain of farmed Atlantic salmon from Sunndalsora, Norway, with its principal founder population from the wild, the River Namsen. The fish were reared from eggs in a common environment and assessed for the extent of genetic divergence in several fitness-related traits. Morphology had diverged, as farmed juveniles showed more robust bodies and smaller rayed fins than the wild juveniles. Ecologically important aspects of behaviour also differed. Farmed juveniles were more aggressive in a tank environment typical of culture facilities, while wild juveniles dominated in a stream-like environment. Farmed juveniles were also more risk-prone, reappearing from cover sooner after a simulated predator attack. It was not surprising that growth performance was higher in farmed than wild juveniles, as the former had been subjected to intentional selection for this trait. Correlated responses to this selection may also explain the higher rate of smolting and lower rate of male parr maturity in the farmed than the wild salmon. Competition with wild juveniles, however, negatively affected the growth of the farmed juveniles, particularly under semi-natural conditions. Our results indicate that farming of Atlantic salmon generates rapid genetic change, as a result of both intentional and unintentional selection in culture, that alters important fitness-related traits.

AB  - Six isocaloric (3.65 kcal/g), isonitrogenous (35% dry-basis [db] protein), ingredient blends were prepared with 0, 17.5, 20, 22.5, 25, and 27.5% distiller’s dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and other ingredients (soybean meal, corn, fish meal, whey, soybean oil, vitamin and mineral mix). The blends were moisture balanced to 15% db, then extruded in a twin screw extruder using a 2 mm die at 190 rpm, and a 3 mm die at 348 rpm. Analyses of the extrudates included moisture content, expansion ratio, unit density, bulk density, sinking velocity, color (L*, a*, and b*), water absorption, water solubility, and pellet durability indices. Increasing the DDGS level from 0 to 17.5% db resulted in decreased expansion ratios by 14.8 and 23.5% for the products extruded using a 2 and 3 mm die, respectively. No significant difference in expansion ratio existed for DDGS levels between 17.5 and 27.5% db for either die. The water solubility index (WSI) of the extrudates increased (25.2 and 24.0%) as the DDGS increased from 0 to 27.5% db for each die. The 0% DDGS had the highest expansion ratio and the lowest unit density, bulk density, and sinking velocity. The extrudates that contained 20 and 27.5% DDGS had the highest durability and sinking velocity values.

AB  - The exponential growth of the salmonid farming industry during the last 3 decades has created conditions for massive escapes of these exotic species into natural environments in southern Chile. Here, we review and update information about salmonid escapes from 1993 to 2012 and examine their potential environmental, social, and economic consequences. We estimate that more than 1 million salmonids escape each year from marine farms, mainly due to weather conditions and technical and operational failures of net-pens. While a decrease in the magnitude of escaped Atlantic and coho salmon has occurred during the last several years, escaped rainbow trout have not followed the same pattern. Rainbow trout have become a greater threat to native ecosystems due to their greater potential to establish self-sustaining naturalized populations. The main ecological effects of escapees are related to short-term predatory effects upon native fish, long-term effects linked to the likelihood of farmed salmon establishing self-sustainable popula- tions, and disease and pathogen transfer to native fauna. More research is needed to identify and develop reliable indicators to estimate the impact of escapees at the ecosystem level in both mar- ine and freshwater systems. An understanding of the mechanisms of coexistence between native fishes and introduced non-native salmonids may be useful to design effective management strate- gies aimed at protecting native fish from salmonid introductions. A precautionary approach that encourages local artisanal and recreational fisheries to counteract colonization and naturalization of salmon species in southern Chile may constitute another management option.

AB  - Risk analysis provides a logical strategy for the identification of hazards in an area of concern leading to their management. This approach has rarely been used for research studies on the possible links between salmon lice in fish farms and variations in wild salmonid populations. Although correlation has been found between some data sets, a series of international meetings of experts has not been able to establish cause–effect relationships between lice on farms and the current low level of salmonid stocks in Europe and eastern Canada. Research in this area is currently in progress in western Canada. Views on the meaning of the correlations found have become highly polarized in both the scientific and non-scientific communities, with the same data often being interpreted in different ways. Farm lice levels are being managed by industry codes and by official strategies in Europe, but these programmes have not so far resulted in associated benefit to the size of wild salmonid stocks. The large array of factors that cause variations in both the size of fish stocks and the level of fish diseases is frequently overlooked. Using a risk analysis approach, the key contributory factors may be identified and appropriate remedial management actions designed to meet achievable objectives. Regular assessment of the effectiveness of the measures introduced would then be possible.

AB  - Eco-certification is widely considered a tool for reducing environmental impacts of aquaculture, but what are the likely environmental outcomes for the world's fastest growing animal-food production sector? This article analyzes a number of eco-certification schemes based on species choice, anticipated share of the global seafood market, size of eligible producers, and targeted environmental impacts. The potential of eco-certification to reduce the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture at scale presently appears uncertain as: (a) certification schemes currently focus on species predominantly consumed in the EU and US, with limited coverage of Asian markets; (b) the share of certified products in the market as currently projected is too low; (c) there is an inequitable and non-uniform applicability of certification across the sector; (d) mechanisms or incentives for improvement among the worst performers are lacking; and (e) there is incomplete coverage of environmental impacts, with biophysical sustainability and ecosystem perspectives generally lacking.

AB  - Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing animal food production sector and will soon supply more than half of the world's seafood for human consumption. Continued growth in aquaculture production is likely to come from intensification of fish, shellfish, and algae production. Intensification is often accompanied by a range of resource and environmental problems. We review several potential solutions to these problems, including novel culture systems, alternative feed strategies, and species choices. We examine the problems addressed; the stage of adoption; and the benefits, costs, and constraints of each solution. Policies that provide incentives for innovation and environmental improvement are also explored. We end the review by identifying easily adoptable solutions and promising technologies worth further investment.

AB  - Appropriate antimicrobial therapy represents one of the most effective management responses to emergencies associated with infectious disease epizootics. The use of these agents, however, has the potential to increase the frequencies of bacterial resistance and this would have a negative impact on the subsequent use of these agents to control infectious disease in aquaculture. There is also a possibility that the enrichment of resistant bacteria or genes encoding resistance could have an adverse impact on the use of antimicrobial agents to control diseases in humans and other land-based animals. Attempts to apply formal risk analysis to this problem have been frustrated by the extreme diversity of aquaculture and by the general shortage of relevant data. A central argument made in this paper is, however, that not only do we lack the data this exercise would require; we also lack validated methods for collecting those data in the first place. At the most fundamental level we do not even possess validated methods for determining whether a bacterium isolated from an aquaculture site should or should not be classified as resistant. In the absence of any significant risk assessment, current attempts at risk management are centred on the development of lists of critically important antimicrobials for the various users of these agents. It is argued here that studies of gene ecology and models of gene flow in the environment are urgently required if we are to be able to evaluate this risk management approach, to predict its consequences or to generate more appropriate strategies.

AB  - A sea cage, sometimes referred to as a net pen, is an enclosure designed to prevent farm fish from escaping and to protect them from large predators, while allowing a free flow of water through the cage to carry away waste. Farm fish thus share water with wild fish, which enables transmission of parasites, such as sea lice, from wild to farm and farm to wild fishes. Sea lice epidemics, together with recently documented population-level declines of wild salmon in areas of sea-cage farming, are a reminder that sea-cage aquaculture is fundamentally different from terrestrial animal culture. The difference is that sea cages protect farm fish from the usual pathogen-control mechanisms of nature, such as predators, but not from the pathogens themselves. A sea cage thus becomes an unintended pathogen factory. Basic physical theory explains why sea-cage aquaculture causes sea lice on sympatric wild fish to increase and why increased lice burdens cause wild fish to decline, with extirpation as a real possibility. Theory is important to this issue because slow declines of wild fish can be difficult to detect amid large fluctuations from other causes. The important theoretical concepts are equilibrium, host-density effect, reservoir-host effect, and critical stocking level of farmed fish (stocking level at which lice proliferate on farm fish even if wild fish are not present to infect them). I explored these concepts and their implications without mathematics through examples from salmon farming. I also considered whether the lice-control techniques used by sea-cage farmers (medication and shortened grow-out times) are capable of protecting wild fish. Elementary probability showed that [graphic removed] (where W is the abundance of wild fish, W* is the prefarm abundance, F is the abundance of farm fish, and [graphic removed] is the ratio of lice per farm fish to lice per wild fish). Declines of wild fish can be reduced by short growing cycles for farm fish, medicating farm fish, and keeping farm stocking levels low. Declines can be avoided only by ensuring that wild fish do not share water with farmed fish, either by locating sea cages very far from wild fish or through the use of closed-containment aquaculture systems. These principles are likely to govern any aquaculture system where cage-protected farm hosts and sympatric wild hosts have a common parasite with a direct life cycle.

AB  - Abstract We report on a 3-year study of the infestation rates of the sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, on wild juvenile pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia. In 2002, the British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food ordered farm fallowing (i.e., the removal of farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from net-cages) along the presumed migration route of wild juvenile Pacific salmon in this area. The goal was to protect wild juvenile fish from sea louse infestation. We assessed the effectiveness of this decision by comparing sea louse infestation rates on wild juvenile salmon near three Atlantic salmon farm sites prior to, during, and after fallowing. Overall, L. salmonis levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) at the study sites during fallowing but returned to the original level after fallowing. The decline was age specific. While the abundance of the earliest attached sea louse phase (the copepodid stage) declined b...

AB  - ABSTRACTManaging and regulating aquaculture is a complicated issue. From the perspective of fish farmers as well as regulators managing aquaculture can be regarded as what political scientists refer to as a “wicked problem.” This is because there is a great extent of uncertainty and lack of firm knowledge with respect to the externalities of aquaculture production; e.g., diseases, environmental impacts, and conflicts with other user interests. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the aquaculture sector contributes to the uncertainty as new solutions emerge, rendering established knowledge obsolete or irrelevant. Designing appropriate public regulations and policy measures is thus important, but difficult. Based on empirical data from Norway, we investigate what respondents from public agencies and the industry perceive to be challenges in governing aquaculture and what we may infer on the characteristics of a good governance approach. We propose that such an approach needs to focus on building competence, c...

AB  - The debate around neoliberal globalisation and its impacts on economically peripheral countries has been waged by partisan forces to the right and left since the early 1990s. Much of this debate focuses at the scale of the nation-state, or of the whole globe, and, while often sophisticated in an ideological sense, is scant in terms of consideration of the ‘grounded’ outcomes of the processes and discourses of globalisation. This paper argues that an appreciation of the contingent economic geography and political economy of any given local and regional transformation is essential for understanding the outcomes of economic globalisation. In order to illustrate this, the paper analyses two regional non-traditional agricultural export (NTAX) complexes in the highly globalised Chilean economy. By focusing on ‘hotspots’ or ‘globalised spaces’ at the regional and local scales we are able to cut through the rhetoric associated with generalised arguments for and against economic globalisation and illustrate that both the roots and impacts of the insertion into global commodity complexes are highly geographically contingent. Our analysis concludes that NTAX development in Chile over the past 25 years has radically restructured local and regional economies, has concentrated wealth ‘extra-regionally’, has exacerbated social differentiation, and threatens environmental sustainability. We argue that policy that seeks to address these trends requires more grounded consideration of the complex and uneven geography of economic globalisation that does not privilege analysis at any one scale and that seeks to elucidate the links between the ‘global’ and the ‘local’.

AB  - Early reports accounted for two main genotypes of Piscirickettsia salmonis, a fish pathogen and causative agent of piscirickettsiosis, placing the single isolate EM-90 apart from the prototypic LF-89 and related isolates. In this study, we provide evidence that, contrary to what has been supposed, the EM-90-like isolates are highly prevalent and disseminated across Chilean marine farms. Molecular analysis of 507 P. salmonis field isolates derived from main rearing areas, diverse hosts and collected over 6 years, revealed that nearly 50% of the entire collection were indeed typed as EM-90-like. Interestingly, these isolates showed a marked host preference, being recovered exclusively from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) samples. Although both strains produce undistinguishable pathological outcomes, differences regarding growth kinetics and susceptibility to the antibiotics and bactericidal action of serum could be identified. In sum, our results allow to conclude that the EM-90-like isolates represent an epidemiologically relevant group in the current situation of piscirickettsiosis. Based on the consistency between genotype and phenotype exhibited by this strain, we point out the need for genotypic studies that may be as important for the Chilean salmon industry as the continuous surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.

AB  - Microbial resistance to antibiotics currently spans all known classes of natural and synthetic compounds. It has not only hindered our treatment of infections but also dramatically reshaped drug discovery, yet its origins have not been systematically studied. Soil-dwelling bacteria produce and encounter a myriad of antibiotics, evolving corresponding sensing and evading strategies. They are a reservoir of resistance determinants that can be mobilized into the microbial community. Study of this reservoir could provide an early warning system for future clinically relevant antibiotic resistance mechanisms.

AB  - Life Cycle Assessment(LCA) was applied to evaluate the global environmental impact of two scenarios of trout production systems based on the operational information from an operational farm using a flow through system (FFF) and an experimental pilot low head recirculating system (RSF) located on the same site. The main differences between the environmental balances of the two systems were relative to water use, eutrophication potential and energy use. Independently of the system used, feed is the key indicator in determining the environmental balance (notwithstanding eutrophication potential and water dependence) monitored by fish production, chemical products, buildings and energy consumption. Consequently, when considering the RSF with a lower feed conversion ratio (0.8 versus 1.1 for FTF), the environmental balance of the RSF is more favourable at both global and regional levels, except with regards to energy use. RSF water dependence is 93% lower than the FTF and its eutrophication potential is 26-38% lower due to reduced waste release. On the other hand, at 57,659 MJ per ton of fish produced ( 16 kWh per kg), the RSF consumes 24-40% more energy than the FTF, especially for aeration and water treatment. Nevertheless, the RSF has significant potential for energy reduction through improvements to airlift and biofilter designs which Would reduce RSF energy use to a level similar to that of the FTF (34,869-43,841 MJ per ton of fish produced, corresponding to 10 and 12 kWh respectively). LCA is therefore a powerful tool which can be used on fish farms to define and prioritise the most promising potential improvements to the system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) belongs to the genus Isavirus, family Orthomyxoviridae. ISAV occurs in two basic genotypes, North American and European. The European genotype is more widespread and shows greater genetic variation and greater virulence variation than the North American genotype. To date, all of the ISAV isolates from the clinical disease, ISA, have had deletions in the highly polymorphic region (HPR) on ISAV segment 6 (ISAV-HPRΔ) relative to ISAV-HPR0, named numerically from ISAV-HPR1 to over ISAV-HPR30. ISA outbreaks have only been reported in farmed Atlantic salmon, although ISAV has been detected by RT-PCR in wild fish. It is recognized that asymptomatically ISAV-infected fish exist. There is no universally accepted ISAV RT-qPCR TaqMan® assay. Most diagnostic laboratories use the primer-probe set targeting a 104 bp-fragment on ISAV segment 8. Some laboratories and researchers have found a primer-probe set targeting ISAV segment 7 to be more sensitive. Other researchers have published different ISAV segment 8 primer-probe sets that are highly sensitive. In this study, we tested 1,106 fish tissue samples collected from (i) market-bought farmed salmonids and (ii) wild salmon from throughout British Columbia (BC), Canada, for ISAV using real time RT-qPCR targeting segment 8 and/or conventional RT-PCR with segment 8 primers and segment 6 HPR primers, and by virus isolation attempts using Salmon head kidney (SHK-1 and ASK-2) cell line monolayers. The sequences from the conventional PCR products were compared by multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses. Seventy-nine samples were “non-negative” with at least one of these tests in one or more replicates. The ISAV segment 6 HPR sequences from the PCR products matched ISAV variants, HPR5 on 29 samples, one sample had both HPR5 and HPR7b and one matched HPR0. All sequences were of European genotype. In addition, alignment of sequences of the conventional PCR product segment 8 showed they had a single nucleotide mutation in the region of the probe sequence and a 9-nucleotide overlap with the reverse primer sequence of the real time RT-qPCR assay. None of the classical ISAV segment 8 sequences in the GenBank have this mutation in the probe-binding site of the assay, suggesting the presence of a novel ISAV variant in BC. A phylogenetic tree of these sequences showed that some ISAV sequences diverted early from the classical European genotype sequences, while others have evolved separately. All virus isolation attempts on the samples were negative, and thus the samples were considered “negative” in terms of the threshold trigger set for Canadian federal regulatory action; i.e., successful virus isolation in cell culture. This is the first published report of the detection of ISAV sequences in fish from British Columbia, Canada. The sequences detected, both of ISAV-HPRΔ and ISAV-HPR0 are of European genotype. These sequences are different from the classical ISAV segment 8 sequences, and this difference suggests the presence of a new ISAV variant of European genotype in BC. Our results further suggest that ISAV-HPRΔ strains can be present without clinical disease in farmed fish and without being detected by virus isolation using fish cell lines.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation into the structure of the salmon retail market in the UK. Evidence of the potential for market power is analysed using non‐linear three‐stage least squares to estimate a dynamic error correction model (ECM) following Bresnahan (1982) and Lau (1982) theoretical approaches. Results indicate that the system is well represented by the model and that the market is competitive in both the short and long run. This is the first study using this approach for the UK fish market and our conclusions support findings from previous empirical analyses of the food retail market, albeit using a different methodology.

AB  - The increasing share of imported food in the United States, coupled with highly publicized incidents of food contamination and adulteration in Asia, particularly China, is posing new challenges for consumers and food safety regulators. In this study, we focus on imported shrimp and tilapia, to evaluate consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for enhanced food safety, use of antibiotics, and eco-friendly environmental practices. Results show that U.S. consumers were willing-to-pay more for enhanced food safety, followed by the use of no antibiotics and environmental friendly production practices. American consumers in our sample were found to have a higher WTP for domestic products and placed more trust on U.S. government verification of product attributes followed by third-party certification.

Predator exposure (lasting 2 h), which took place in an aquarium where a transparent wall separated the damselfish from the predator (a graysby, Epinephelus cruentatus), resulted in increased concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, the main serotonin metabolite) and 1.6-1.8 fold elevations of 5-HIAA/serotonin ratios (an index of serotonergic activity) in telencephalon, hypothalamus and brain stem. The results show that predator exposure, like intraspecific social stress, induces increased brain serotonergic activity in fish. Different types of stress also elevate brain serotonergic activity in mammals, indicating that this is a phylogenetically very old stress response, possibly helping the animal's coping response.

AB  - Parasites seldom have predators but often fall victim to those of their hosts. How parasites respond to host predation can have important consequences for both hosts and parasites, though empirical investigations are rare. The exposure of wild juvenile salmon to sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) from salmon farms allowed us to study a novel ecological interaction: the response of sea lice to predation on their juvenile pink and chum salmon hosts by two salmonid predators—coho smolts and cut-throat trout. In approximately 70% of trials in which a predator consumed a parasitized prey, lice escaped predation by swimming or moving directly onto the predator. This trophic transmission is strongly male biased, probably because behaviour and morphology constrain female movement and transmission. These findings highlight the potential for sea lice to be transmitted up marine food webs in areas of intensive salmon aquaculture, with implications for louse population dynamics and predatory salmonid health.

AB  - Pacific salmon have been fished extensively for at least a century and artificial production of Pacific salmon has been a management strategy to improve production for almost as long. Hatchery production is considered important because it is commonly believed that the carrying capacity for salmon in the ocean has remained more or less constant and is underutilized as a consequence of limited production of smolts in fresh water. Since the mid-1960s, there has been an increase in hatchery production, partly as a response to a desire to increase catch and partly because of improved hatchery techniques. Since the late 1970s there has been a dramatic increase in the total Pacific salmon catch. The increases in catch are now known to result from a large-scale shift in the productivity of the sub-arctic Pacific and management and enhancement actions. Environmental indices changed about 1989-1990 and may indicate that the productive regime of the 1980s has ended. This would imply that under natural conditions Pacific salmon abundance would decline. There are no clear indications of what to expect in the new regime, but it is apparent that the massive production of artificially reared Pacific salmon would not be necessary in a less productive regime. Of concern is the impact that the large numbers of artificially reared salmon will have on wild salmon stock levels.

AB  - During the last decades aquaculture has been one of the world's fastest growing food production technologies. This is primarily due to increased control over the production process that has enabled innovations, productivity growth, and reduced production costs. Compared to agriculture, production technology, research, and development in aquaculture are still not very sophisticated, and control over the production process is still limited. This implies that there still is potential for further innovations and productivity growth in aquaculture. Although one must face similar environmental challenges as agriculture, there is no doubt that intensive aquaculture can be sustainable. Moreover, increased food production from the sea can reduce pressure on marginal terrestrial land and deforestation. As the productivity potential in aquaculture is exploited, aquaculture production is set to continue its increase, and humanity will, to an increasing extent, also farm the sea.

AB  - Abstract: A minimum necessary condition for sustainability is the maintenance of the total natural capital stock at or above the current level. While a lower stock of natural capital may be sustainable, society can allow no further decline in natural capital given the large uncertainty and the dire consequences of guessing wrong. This “constancy of total natural capital” rule can thus be seen as a prudent minimum condition for assuring sustainability, to be relaxed only when solid evidence can be offered that it is safe to do so.

We discuss methodological issues concerning the degree of substitutability of manufactured for natural capital, quantifying ecosystem services and natural capital, and the role of the discount rate in valuing natural capital. We differentiate the concepts of growth (material increase in size) and development (improvement in organization without size change). Given these definitions, growth cannot the sustainable indefinitely on a finite planet. Development may be sustainable, but even this aspect of change may have some limits. One problem is that current measures of economic well-being at the macro level (i.e., the Gross National Product) measure mainly growth, or at best conflate growth and development. This urgently requires revision.

Finally, we suggest some principles of sustainable development and describe why maintaining natural capital stocks is a prudent and achievable policy for insuring sustainable development. There is disagreement between technological optimists (who see technical progress as eliminating all resource constraints to growth and development) and technological skeptics (who do not see as much scope for this approach and fear irreversible use of resources and damage to natural capital). By maintaining natural capital stocks (preferably by using a natural capital depletion tax), we can satisfy both the skeptics (since resources will be conserved for future generations) and the optimists (since this will raise the price of natural capital depletion and more rapidly induce the technical change they predict).

AB  - Increasing globalization of our food supply combined with recent outbreaks of foodborne disease has heightened concerns over food safety issues around the globe. In response to these growing concerns, both by government and consumers, many nations are looking at food traceability as a means to restore confidence in the food supply and limit damages incurred by the sale and distribution of unsafe products. Traceability, which allows for the tracking of food products through all steps of production, distribution, and sales, can provide information on the nature, origin, and quality of a product; allowing consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions while providing the mechanisms for quick and thorough product recall procedures. Implementing traceablity systems will require improved vertical intergration between entities and the development of standars for the collection and dissemination of traceability data. Fortunately, rapid advances in information technology have made it possible to implement traceability systems within the food industry. This review will explore the current trends toward tracebility in the U.S. seafood industry. Current legislation, both here and abroad, and its effects on the seafood industry will be explored, and the design of a traceability system will be discussed.

AB  - The salmon aquaculture industry has experienced substantial expansion during the last two decades. This expansion is largely the result of increased productivity, with a complementary decrease in costs. A general reduction in production costs has been accompanied by substantial shifts in the shares of inputs. Hence, one may question whether the technology has changed so much that some input factors are no longer substitutes in production. In this study, we investigate this by estimating a translog cost function focusing on the difference between full and partial static equilibrium specifications. The results from the different specifications provide evidence of limited or zero substitution possibilities in salmon production. This implies that salmon farming today can be thought of as a converter or refinement industry where less valuable fish (the feed) are converted into higher-valued product.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The rapid growth of the salmon farming industry in Chile has led to the appearance of various viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal pathogens affecting farmed fish. The Chilean salmon industry has suffered several health crises associated with high fish mortalities, such as caused by the infectious salmon anaemia virus (2007) and harmful algal blooms (2016). In addition to these events, marine farms are continuously affected by outbreaks of harmful pathogens, including the bacteria <jats:italic>Piscirickettsia salmonis</jats:italic> and, most recently, a reappearance of <jats:italic>Renibacterium salmoninarum</jats:italic>, and the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus. These outbreaks have led to stricter regulations, but the salmon farming industry continues to struggle despite reforms. In addition to the aforementioned pathogens, which are a continuous threat, other apparently under control pathogens have also reappeared in recent years. In this review, we analyse the current state of knowledge on four of the main pathogens affecting salmon farming in Chile. The infectious pancreatic necrosis virus is relevant as it affects freshwater‐stage fish, with survivors then acting as carriers. The infectious salmon anaemia virus currently appears to be under control; however, <jats:italic>P. salmonis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>R. salmoninarum</jats:italic> continue to be the cause for high mortalities in the Chilean aquaculture industry.</jats:p>

AB  - Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have gained increasing interest in recent years as a means to intensify fish production while at the same time minimize the environmental impact. Considerable hands-on experience has accumulated within the Nordic countries over the last 20–30 years in designing, building, and operating intensive land-based RAS for different species. This study compiles and assesses published literature along with un-published hands-on experiences with rearing different species in RAS in the Nordic countries, including Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), European eel (Anguilla anguilla), pike perch (Stizostedion lucioperca), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), sturgeon (order Acipenseriformes), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and European lobster (Homarus gammarus). High capital costs are one of the biggest challenges to sustainable RAS calling for large scale intensive productions to reduce investment and operation costs. Consistent with this, production of Atlantic salmon smolts in indoor RAS and rainbow trout in outdoor Model-Trout-Farms (MTFs) have been the commercially most successful productions so far. Aside from end-of-pipe treatment including sludge handling and efficient nitrogen removal, much of the RAS technology applied is well known and is, as such, more or less ready to apply for culturing a variety of species. Successful production of “new” species in RAS therefore largely comes down to identifying the biological requirements of that specific species, and designing the RAS to fulfill and support the specific requirements. Well established brood-stocks and continuous supply of offspring is furthermore a prerequisite for successful RAS production of most species. Successful operations of less intensive RAS such as aquaponic systems appear to be feasible primarily when culturing more exotic species targeted for selected customers.

AB  - Policy analyses frequently clash. Their disagreements stem from many sources, including models, empirical estimates, and values such as who should have standing and how different criteria should be weighted. We provide a simple taxonomy of disagreement, identifying distinct categories within both the positive and values domains of normative policy analysis. Using disagreements in climate policy to illustrate, we demonstrate how illuminating the structure of disagreement helps to clarify the way forward. We conclude by suggesting a structure for policy analysis that can facilitate assessment, comparison, and debate by laying bare the most likely sources of disagreement.

AB  - Aquaculture is an expanding activity worldwide. However its rapid growth can affect the aquatic environment through release of large amounts of chemicals, including antibiotics. Moreover, the presence of organic matter and bacteria of different origin can favor gene transfer and recombination. Whereas the consequences of such activities on environmental microbiota are well explored, little is known of their effects on allochthonous and potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as enterococci. Sediments from three sampling stations (two inside and one outside) collected in a fish farm in the Adriatic Sea were examined for enterococcal abundance and antibiotic resistance traits using the membrane filter technique and an improved quantitative PCR. Strains were tested for susceptibility to tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and gentamicin; samples were directly screened for selected tetracycline [tet(M), tet(L), tet(O)] and macrolide [erm(A), erm(B) and mef] resistance genes by newly-developed multiplex PCRs. The abundance of benthic enterococci was higher inside than outside the farm. All isolates were susceptible to the four antimicrobials tested, although direct PCR evidenced tet(M) and tet(L) in sediment samples from all stations. Direct multiplex PCR of sediment samples cultured in rich broth supplemented with antibiotic (tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin or gentamicin) highlighted changes in resistance gene profiles, with amplification of previously undetected tet(O), erm(B) and mef genes and an increase in benthic enterococcal abundance after incubation in the presence of ampicillin and gentamicin. Despite being limited to a single farm, these data indicate that aquaculture may influence the abundance and spread of benthic enterococci and that farm sediments can be reservoirs of dormant antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including enterococci, which can rapidly revive in presence of new inputs of organic matter. This reservoir may constitute an underestimated health risk and deserves further investigation.

AB  - In rainbow trout the magnitude of the cortisol response to stress shows both consistency over time and a moderate to high degree of heritability, and high responding (HR) and low responding (LR) lines of rainbow trout have been generated by individual selection for consistently high or low post-stress cortisol values. Using 2nd and 3rd generation fish, we tested the hypothesis that differential stress responsiveness is associated with behavioral alterations in the HR-LR trout model. LR fish showed a tendency to become socially dominant, a rapid recovery of food intake after transfer to a novel environment, and a reduced locomotor response in a territorial intrusion test. Furthermore, stress induced elevation of brain stem and optic tectum concentrations of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine and their metabolites suggests that both synthesis and metabolism of these transmitters were elevated after stress to a larger degree in HR than in LR trout. A divergent pattern was seen in the hypothalamus, where LR fish displayed elevated levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a serotonin metabolite) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (a norepinephrine metabolite). Thus, selection for a single trait, cortisol responsiveness, in rainbow trout is associated with concurrent changes in both behavior and central signaling systems. The apparent parallel to genetically determined stress coping styles in mammals, and the existence of similar trait associations in unselected populations of rainbow trout, suggests an evolutionarily conserved correlation between multiple traits. Continuing studies on the HR and LR trout lines are aimed at providing the physiological and genetic basis for new marker-assisted selection strategies in the rapidly developing finfish aquaculture industry, as well as increased knowledge of the function and evolution of central neuroendocrine signaling systems.

AB  - Abstract Reports of infestations of sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi in juvenile salmonids in Pacific Canada have been restricted to pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta from one salmon-farming region, the Broughton Archipelago of British Columbia. Here, we report on 2 years of sea louse field surveys of wild juvenile pink and chum salmon, as well as wild sockeye salmon O. nerka and larval Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, in another salmon farming region, the Discovery Islands region of British Columbia. For pink and chum salmon we tested for the dependency of sea louse abundance on temperature, salinity, sampling period, host species, and farm exposure category. For both louse species, farm exposure was the only consistently significant predictor of sea lice abundance. Fish exposed to salmon farms were infected with more sea lice than those in the peripheral category. Sea louse abundance on sockeye salmon and Pacific herring followed the same trends, but sample ...

AB  - Farmed Atlantic salmon escape unintentionally from hatcheries and fish farm and occur both in the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. These fish exploit natural feeding areas in fresh water and at sea, introgress natural populations (Fleming et al. 2000; O’Reilly et al. 2006; Castillo et al. 2008), and reduce the survival of wild populations that are exposed to salmon farms (Ford and Myers 2008). Worldwide salmonid aquaculture production has grown rapidly during the last 30–40 years, from less than 200,000 tonnes in 1970 to over one million tonnes in 2000 (Tacon 2003), and the production has continued to increase to more than 1.4 million tonnes in 2007 (FAO 2010). With this increase, the number of escaped farmed salmon has also increased through regular low-level leakages and episodic events such as wreckage of rearing pens at sea because of heavy weather.

AB  - Durante los ultimos 20 anos, la produccion de salmon y trucha arcoiris en Noruega se ha incrementado en un 10% al ano y sobrepasara 1 millon de toneladas para el 2010. Todo el proceso de "engorda" ocurre en balsas-jaulas emplazadas en los fiordos y zonas costeras. El volumen promedio de una balsa-jaula se ha incrementado en un 300% desde sus inicios en 1980. En un universo de 4,000 balsas-jaulas se tiene que mas de 1.200 encierran un volumen de entre 20.000-60.000 m3. En el 2005, el termino de "maxima biomasa permisible" o en ingles maximum allowable biomass (MAB) fue acunado y cuantita-tivamente limita la produccion a un maximo anual de 65 tons metricas por cada 1.000 m3 de volumen de agua concesionado. Por lo general, el incremento del volumen y profundidad de las balsas-jaulas ha traido como consecuencia una mayor dificultad en el control y manipulacion de los peces. Los ataques del piojo de mar o sea lice (en ingles), localizados especialmente en el Sur de Noruega, representan en los ultimos tres anos uno de los principales problemas. Reducciones en el crecimiento, incremento en las mortalidades, y tratamientos para controlar la pulga de mar lideran las perdidas economicas en la industria de acuicultura. Algunas publicaciones recientes indican que se ha incrementado el uso de tratamientos por medios biologicos utilizando wrasses que se alimentan de ectoparasitos en las balsas-jaulas mejorando la situacion en el verano del 2010 en comparacion al ano anterior. La vacunacion masiva y una legislacion estricta en relacion a la manipulacion de los peces, etc., han resultado usualmente en una proteccion efectiva en contra de las enfermedades, sin embargo aun persisten focos regionales de enfermedades muy serias, tales como la enfermedad del pancreas (pancreas disease, PD) y la anemia infecciosa del salmon (infectious salmon anaemia, ISA). Los ataques del piojo de mar, asi como el escape de salmones y truchas desde los centros de cultivo de peces son considerados entre las principales razones de la fuerte disminucion de la poblacion natural de reproductores en los fiordos y en la zona costera del sur de Noruega.

AB  - The human population and its consumption profoundly affect the Earth's ecosystems. A particularly compelling measure of humanity's cumulative impact is the fraction of the planet's net primary production that we appropriate for our Net primary production-the net amount of solar energy converted to plant organic matter through photosynthesis-can be measured in units of elemental carbon and represents the primary food energy source for the world's ecosystems. Human appropriation of net primary production, apart from leaving less for other species to use, alters the composition of the atmosphere, levels of biodiversity, flows within food webs and the provision of important primary production required by humans and compare it to the total amount generated on the landscape. We then derive a spatial ba!mce sheet of net primary production supply and demand for the world. We show that human appropriation of net primary production varies spatially from almost zero to many times the local primary production. These analyses reveal the uneven footprint of human consumption and related environmental impacts, indicate the degree to which human populations depend on net primary production "imports" and suggest policy options for slowing future growth of human appropriation of net primary production.

AB  - What we do is determined by the way we "view" a complex issue and what sample of issues or events we choose to deal with. In this paper, a model based on a communal, cultural, or people-centered worldview, informed by a subjective epistemology and a holistic ontology, is considered. Definitions and interpretations of sustainable agriculture are reviewed. Common elements in published definitions of sustainable agriculture and animal production among those who seek long-term and equitable solutions for food production are resource efficiency, profitability, productivity, environmental soundness, biodiversity, social viability, and ethical aspects. Possible characteristics of future sustainable production systems and further development are presented. The impact of these characteristics on animal breeding goals is reviewed. The need for long-term biologically, ecologically, and sociologically sound breeding goals is emphasized, because animal breeding determined only by short-term market forces leads to unwanted side effects. Hence, a procedure for defining animal breeding goals with ethical priorities and weighing of market and non-market values is suggested. Implementation of non-market as well as market economic trait values in the aggregate genotype, as suggested, may allow for breeding programs that contribute to sustainable production systems. Examples of breeding goals in salmon, cattle, and pigs are given, and the resulting genetic responses are evaluated with respect to economic profit (or costs) and other criteria of sustainability. Important prerequisites for breeding programs for sustainable production are appropriate governmental policies, awareness of our way of thinking, and a more communal worldview informed by a subjective epistemology and a holistic ontology.

AB  - EFSA and EMA have jointly reviewed measures taken in the EU to reduce the need for and use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals, and the resultant impacts on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Reduction strategies have been implemented successfully in some Member States. Such strategies include national reduction targets, benchmarking of antimicrobial use, controls on prescribing and restrictions on use of specific critically important antimicrobials, together with improvements to animal husbandry and disease prevention and control measures. Due to the multiplicity of factors contributing to AMR, the impact of any single measure is difficult to quantify, although there is evidence of an association between reduction in antimicrobial use and reduced AMR. To minimise antimicrobial use, a multifaceted integrated approach should be implemented, adapted to local circumstances. Recommended options (non-prioritised) include: development of national strategies; harmonised systems for monitoring antimicrobial use and AMR development; establishing national targets for antimicrobial use reduction; use of on-farm health plans; increasing the responsibility of veterinarians for antimicrobial prescribing; training, education and raising public awareness; increasing the availability of rapid and reliable diagnostics; improving husbandry and management procedures for disease prevention and control; rethinking livestock production systems to reduce inherent disease risk. A limited number of studies provide robust evidence of alternatives to antimicrobials that positively influence health parameters. Possible alternatives include probiotics and prebiotics, competitive exclusion, bacteriophages, immunomodulators, organic acids and teat sealants. Development of a legislative framework that permits the use of specific products as alternatives should be considered. Further research to evaluate the potential of alternative farming systems on reducing AMR is also recommended. Animals suffering from bacterial infections should only be treated with antimicrobials based on veterinary diagnosis and prescription. Options should be reviewed to phase out most preventive use of antimicrobials and to reduce and refine metaphylaxis by applying recognised alternative measures.

AB  - Summary 1. Variance in competitive ability among males should lead to a corresponding skew in reproductive success. Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) males form dominance hierarchies during spawning, such that the dominant individuals are predicted to realize the highest reproductive success. However, the degree to which this occurs depends on various genetic and environmental factors. 2. We investigated the influence of the aquaculture environment on male Atlantic salmon behaviour during spawning in three experiments involving groups of either purely farmed or wild males, or mixed groups composed of equal numbers of farmed and wild fish. The objective of this study was to compare and contrast the formation of dominance hierarchies and relationships between aggression, courtship and spawning success in farmed and wild males. 3. Although farmed males did not establish dominance hierarchies as effectively as wild males, they courted and spawned with females in larger numbers and they frequently failed to release sperm when females released eggs. 4. Dominance structures established by wild males led to reliable behavioural correlates of spawning success; this was not the case among farmed males. 5. From the risk-assessment perspective, farmed males can be expected to have reduced spawning success, although the degree of reproductive inferiority of farmed relative to wild males depends upon rearing environment and the populations under consideration.

AB  - In this paper variations in life history data among local populations of Atlantic salmon have been examined. The following patterns emerge: (1) The mean age of first spawning increases with the difficulty of upstream migration as estimated by the distance the fish ascend into freshwater. Other indices of river harshness yield similar results. (2) The effect of commercial fishing has been to eliminate larger and older fish from the run. Available evidence suggests that this has selected for an early age of first return on the Miramichi River and that the frequencies of genes coding for different ages of first spawning have been altered. (3) The mean age of first spawning is positively correlated with marine growth rates after the grilse stage. Rapid growth at sea subsequent to the grilse stage is associated with delayed reproduction; slower growth with an earlier age of first breeding. This result suggests different paths of high—seas migration. (4) The variability about the mean age of first spawning first increases and then decreases as one moves north over the salmon's range from Maine to Ungava. In addition, we have observed that these results are in accord with predictions made by recent theoretical analyses of the optimal reproductive response to differing environmental conditions. We, therefore, conclude that the observed patterns of variation in life history are adaptive. We further take the agreement between theory and nature as a validation of the hypothesis that populations will in general differ from each other in the manner of their respective optima.

AB  - The large majority of antibiotics currently used for treating infections and the antibiotic resistance genes acquired by human pathogens each have an environmental origin. Recent work indicates that the function of these elements in their environmental reservoirs may be very distinct from the "weapon-shield" role they play in clinical settings. Changes in natural ecosystems, including the release of large amounts of antimicrobials, might alter the population dynamics of microorganisms, including selection of resistance, with consequences for human health that are difficult to predict.

AB  - Abstract The supply chain for salmon is, in many respects, the world's most efficient seafood supply chain. Adopting new technologies and expanding the scale of production have improved competitiveness leading to increased production and industry growth. The transfer of knowledge and processes from other food producing industries has facilitated growth in salmon aquaculture in particular, and in aquaculture in general. As such, the maturity of the salmon industry relative to other food producing industries can provide indications of further growth potential. We argue that the salmon industry still has much to learn from similar processes in other food-growing industries. Notably, the production and processing of poultry has experienced significant increases since the 1940s, becoming the fastest growing and most rapidly changing highly-intensive livestock farming segment, with often fully-automated processing environments. Although farmed salmon has a production history closely following that of poultry, it remains semi-automated with less control over production processes and a more limited product specter than poultry. While this gives important avenues of growth for salmon, it holds even more potential for other aquaculture species with even less control over the production processes and supply chain. Statement of relevance Innovations leading to productivity growth and improved competitiveness throughout the supply chain have been key to the development of successful aquaculture industries. To a large extent, innovations have built on knowledge from the agrosciences. In this paper we compare the development of salmon aquaculture, one of the most sophisticated aquaculture industries with chicken, one of the most sophisticated terrestrial animal production industries. This sheds new light on the development of salmon aquaculture and it show that there is s large knowledge potential still to be tapped form chicken production, giving substantial promise of further development.

AB  - Summary Consumer preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for certain non-market food process attributes were investigated using a choice experiment. Swedish consumers were found to be willing to pay a price premium for the use of mobile abattoirs for cattle but not for broilers. We used two different survey versions, with and without an opt-out alternative. There is no evidence that omission of the optout alternative leads to biased choices. In addition, respondents who chose to opt-out were no different from those making trade-offs between attributes. The inclusion of an opt-out alternative has no significant effect on the marginal WTP. Based on estimated distributions of WTP and available cost estimates, the market share for mobile abattoirs is predicted. Here we do find differences between the two survey versions: the version with an opt-out alternative revealed greater unobserved heterogeneity.

AB  - By exploring the emergence of new clusters, this paper departs from traditional research focused on established clusters and enriches recent studies on their development dynamics. The analysis of two successful clusters in Chile, one in agroindustry and the other in salmon aquaculture, highlights interactions between the state, local firms and multinationals, and the conditions enhancing collective firm learning. The argument is that the emergence of dynamic clusters depends on building institutions that enable coordinated learning among firms to improve capabilities, processes and products.

AB  - Models and tools for assessing the carrying capacity of an area of interest for bivalve culture can be classified according to their level of complexity and scope. In this report, we discuss and outline four hierarchical categories of carrying capacity studies: physical, production, ecological, and social carrying capacity. The assessment of carrying capacity for progressively higher categories of models is based on a sound understanding of preceding categories. We discuss each in brief and the third in more detail as this is the level at which knowledge is the most lacking and for which science may make the most advances. (1) Physical carrying capacity may be assessed by a combination of hydrodynamic models and physical information, ideally presented and analysed within a Geographic Information System (GIS). (2) Most scientific effort to date has been directed towards modelling production carrying capacity and some of the resulting models have been used successfully to this end. Further development of these models should pay attention to (i) better modelling of feedback mechanisms between bivalve culture and the environment, (ii) a consideration of all steps in the culture process (seed collection, ongrowing, harvesting, and processing), and (iii) culture technique. (3) The modelling of ecological carrying capacity is still in its infancy. The shortcomings mentioned for models for production carrying capacity estimates are even greater for ecological carrying capacity models. GIS may be employed to consider interactions between culture activities and sensitive habitats. (4) It is recommended that social carrying capacity be evaluated only after the preceding levels have been completed so that an unbiased assessment is obtained. This however does not exclude direction from managers for scientists as to which factors (such as water clarity, specific habitats, etc.) should be evaluated. The use of expert systems to aid in management decisions is briefly discussed with a suggested application of a fuzzy expert system to this end.

AB  - Examination of 40 time series of multidisciplinary environmental variables from the Pacific Ocean and the Americas, collected in 1968 to 1984, demonstrated the remarkable consistency of a major climate-related, step-like change in 1976. To combine the 40 variables (e.g., air and water temperatures, Southern Oscillation, chlorophyll, geese, salmon, crabs, glaciers, atmospheric dust, coral, carbon dioxide, winds, ice cover, Bering Strait transport) into a single time series, standard variants of individual annual values (subtracting the mean and dividing by a standard deviation) were averaged. Analysis of the resulting time series showed that the single step in 1976, separating the 1968-1975 period from the 1977-1984 period, accounted for 89% of variance within the composite time series. Apparently, one of the Earth's large ecosystems occasionally undergoes large abrupt shifts.

AB  - Temperature increases in Norwegian waters are likely to influence productivity for salmonid aquaculture. As sites are experiencing different temperature regimes, the impact on productivity will vary. The spatial distribution of Norwegian salmon farming depends on both institutional and physical conditions. At present, the general location of farms is restricted by the authorities, but in the case of large productivity differences, this regime may be liberalized. This study analyzes the impact of increased temperature on the spatial distribution of production and employment. We vary temperature and management regime in four scenarios and a 30 year time span. Total production is based on linear demand growth, serving as a restriction in the subsequent model. Productivity per county is determined in a temperature-driven model, and a separate model predicts the relocation of licenses between counties. An input–output model captures the direct and indirect effects of aquaculture production. Our findings indica...

AB  - We report the draft genome sequence from Aeromonas salmonicida sp. strain CBA100, which was characterized as an antibiotic-resistant bacterium isolated from infected rainbow trout. The total size of the genome is 4,788,109 bp, with a G + C content of 60.55%. Comparison of its open reading frames shows that the closest homologue to one third of the genes of strain CBA100 are found in A. hydrophila. The strain contains several efflux pumps and putative genes that confer resistance to multiclass antibiotics, including macrolide, β-lactamics, florfenicol and quinolones. The antibiogram profile suggests that efflux pumps are the main mechanism of resistance to non-β-lactamic antibiotics. This is the first genome of a Chilean isolate of A. salmonicida, which should shed light on the design of strain-specific vaccines against this pathogen and reduce the use of antibiotics for preventive treatment in Chilean aquaculture.

AB  - Antibiotics, once called the "wonder drugs" might be loosing their magic through development and dissemination of bacterial resistance. We are very responsible for that by way of inappropriate and excessive use of them. Although we have not created the problem we have promoted, accelerated and amplifed it. So we used to think. Now we can share the blame: massive use in animal feed, seems to be contributing a great deal to the same effect, and they are not even used to treat infections, but to promote growth and weight gain. Dubious purpose, since same effects can be achieved with better and more hygienic feeding practices. Equal or larger amounts of antibiotics are thought to be used for this purpose than for human health. Resistance in animal flora and transmission to humans has been inevitable. In this issue, F Cabello reports this practice in Chilean aquaculture: greater amounts than in other countries and a wider range of antimicrobials are used here, some sharing chemical and spectrum properties with those for human use, some slowly biodegradable. This situation may have a great impact in bacterial resistance locally, along with other untoward consequences of exposing unnecessarily salmons, humans and the environment to bioactive products. The time to openly discuss the practice, probably quite unknown to the general public, and perhaps to some authorities, has come.

AB  - Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the most important bacterial pathogen for freshwater farmed salmonids in Chile. The aims of this study were to determine the susceptibility to antimicrobials used in fish farming of Chilean isolates and to calculate their epidemiological cut-off (COWT) values. A number of 125 Chilean isolates of F. psychrophilum were isolated from reared salmonids presenting clinical symptoms indicative of flavobacteriosis and their identities were confirmed by 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction. Susceptibility to antibacterials was tested on diluted Mueller-Hinton by using an agar dilution MIC method and a disk diffusion method. The COWT values calculated by Normalised Resistance Interpretation (NRI) analysis allow isolates to be categorized either as wild-type fully susceptible (WT) or as manifesting reduced susceptibility (NWT). When MIC data was used, NRI analysis calculated a COWT of ≤ 0.125 μg mL-1, ≤ 2 μg mL-1 and ≤ 0.5 μg mL-1 for amoxicillin, florfenicol and oxytetracycline, respectively. For the quinolones, the COWT were ≤1 μg mL-1, ≤ 0.5 μg mL-1 and ≤ 0.125 μg mL-1 for oxolinic acid, flumequine and enrofloxacin respectively. The disc diffusion data sets obtained in this work were extremely diverse and were spread over a wide range. For the quinolones there was a close agreement between the frequencies of NWT isolates calculated using MIC and disc data. For oxolinic acid, flumequine and enrofloxacin the frequencies were 45, 39 and 38% using MIC data, and 42, 41 and 44%, when disc data were used. There was less agreement with the other antimicrobials, because NWT frequencies obtained using MIC and disc data respectively, were 24% and 10% for amoxicillin, 8% and 2% for florfenicol and 70% and 64% for oxytetracycline. Considering that the MIC data was more precise than the disc diffusion data, MIC determination would be the preferred method for susceptibility testing for this species and the NWT frequencies derived from the MIC data sets should be considered as the more authoritative. Despite the high frequency of isolates showing full susceptibility to florfenicol, the significant frequencies of isolates exhibiting reduced susceptibility to oxytetracycline and quinolones may result in treatment failures when these agents are used.

AB  - The objective of this study was to present a method to define breeding goals for sustainable dairy cattle production by adding nonmarket values to market economic values for functional traits in the breeding goal. A nonmarket value can represent the value of improved animal welfare or societal influences for animal production. The nonmarket value for mastitis resistance, conception rate, and stillbirth were derived based on how much farmers or breeding companies were willing to lose in selection response for milk yield to improve functional traits. The desired response for milk yield corresponding to a given percent loss was obtained using desired gain indices. By allowing a 5% loss in the selection response for milk yield, the nonmarket value was found to be 40.4 euro for mastitis resistance, 16.1 euro for conception rate, and 9.7 euro for stillbirth. The nonmarket value increased proportionally with increasing loss in the selection response for milk yield, but the selection response was lower for conception rate than for mastitis resistance because of differences in market economic value and heritability. To increase the response for conception rate, the nonmarket value was also derived for 2 situations, in which the desired responses for milk yield, mastitis resistance, and conception rate were specified. The method can be used to define breeding goals for sustainable production and to increase the response for traits that are at critically low levels. When defining breeding goals for sustainable production, breeding organizations should predict the selection response based on market economic value and add non-market value for traits with unacceptable selection responses.

AB  - Despite significant recent public concern and media attention to the environmental impacts of food, few studies in the United States have systematically compared the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with food production against long-distance distribution, aka “food-miles.” We find that although food is transported long distances in general (1640 km delivery and 6760 km life-cycle supply chain on average) the GHG emissions associated with food are dominated by the production phase, contributing 83% of the average U.S. household’s 8.1 t CO2e/yr footprint for food consumption. Transportation as a whole represents only 11% of life-cycle GHG emissions, and final delivery from producer to retail contributes only 4%. Different food groups exhibit a large range in GHG-intensity; on average, red meat is around 150% more GHG-intensive than chicken or fish. Thus, we suggest that dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average household’s food-related climate footprint than “buy...

AB  - Durante la fase de incubacion de ovas de Oncorhynchus mykiss, uno de los mayores problemas que se originan lo constituye el ataque producido por hongos oportunistas presentes en el agua. Los hongos pertenecientes al genero Saprolegnia son los patogenos que atacan mas frecuentemente las ovas de salmonidos. La saprolegniasis se manifiesta mediante la formacion de un revestimiento de hifas que se ubican sobre las ovas muertas, trasladandose rapidamente a las ovas sanas mas cercanas, causando perdidas que oscilan entre 20 y 100%. La implementacion de medidas sanitarias y profilacticas en acuicultura, especialmente en la piscicultura, juegan un papel importante en la prevencion y control de las enfermedades, impidiendo que agentes patogenos ataquen ovas, larvas y peces sanos. Con el fin de estudiar el efecto de los tratamientos profilacticos sobre la incidencia de saprolegniasis y la sobrevivencia a eclosion de ovas de O. mykiss, en instalaciones de cultivo: se implementaron tres tratamientos: limpieza manual, formalina (250 ppm) y sal (NaCl, 30.000 ppm). Una vez eclosionadas las larvas en cada bioensayo se determino el porcentaje de sobrevivencia. Posteriormente se tomaron las larvas sometidas a cada tratamiento y se determino la mortalidad larval despues de 15 dias. Los tratamientos profilacticos lograron mejorar entre 10 y 20% la sobrevivencia embrionaria a eclosion en relacion al control. Los tratamientos de sal y formalina condujeron a una mejor respuesta. No se observaron diferencias significativas (P>0,05) entre los tratamientos en lo que respecta a la mortalidad larval a los 15 dias de la eclosion. El tratamiento con sal es el mas recomendable, no solo por los resultados obtenidos en relacion a la sobrevivencia embrionaria y larval, sino tambien por ser de bajo costo y poco toxico, tanto para peces como humanos. Palabras clave: trucha arco iris, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Saprolegnia, saprolegniasis.

AB  - As aquaculture production expands, we must avoid mistakes made during increasing intensification of agriculture. Understanding environmental impacts and measures to mitigate them is important for designing responsible aquaculture production systems. There are four realistic goals that can make future aquaculture operations more sustainable and productive: (1) improvement of management practices to create more efficient and diverse systems at every production level; (2) emphasis on local decisionmaking, human capacity development, and collective action to generate productive aquaculture systems that fit into societal constraints and demands; (3) development of risk management efforts for all systems that reduce disease problems, eliminate antibiotic and drug abuse, and prevent exotic organism introduction into local waters; and (4) creation of systems to better identify more sustainably grown aquaculture products in the market and promote them to individual consumers. By 2050, seafood will be predominantly sourced through aquaculture, including not only finfish and invertebrates but also seaweeds.

AB  - Industrial antibiotic usage in agribusinesses and aquaculture is theforce that drives the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria that produce human and animal diseasein many countries. Several studies have demonstrated that most of the industrial use of antibiotics isunnecessary, and that modernization and hygienic changes can reduce this use of antibiotics with-out negative economic impact. In Chile, industrial aquaculture of salmon has expanded rapidly inthe last 20 years becoming a major export business. The exponential growth of this industry has beenaccompanied by an unrestricted heavy usage of antibiotics in the aquatic environments of lakes,rivers and the ocean, and its impact is being felt in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteriaaround aquaculture sites and a decrease in the plancktonic diversity in the same areas. The passageof antibiotic resistance genes from aquatic bacteria to human and animal pathogens has been dem-onstrated, indicating that industrial use of antibiotics in aquaculture affects negatively the antibiot-ic therapy of human and animal bacterial infections. The Chilean situation triggers important con-cerns because it includes the use of fluoroquinolones in aquaculture, that are not biodegradableand are able to remain in the environment for years as well as being still effective in treating humaninfections. The use of large volumes of a wide spectrum of antibiotics in an aquatic environmentheavily contaminated with human and animal pathogens also amplifies the opportunities for genetransfer among bacteria, facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistance and more pathogenicbacterial recombinants. The detection of residual antibiotics in salmons marketed for human con-sumption that can modify the normal flora of the population also suggests the need for controls onthis antibiotic usage and on the presence of residual antibiotics in aquaculture food products. Thisimportant problem of public health demands an active dialogue between government officials re-sponsible for protecting public health, aquaculture industry representatives, politicians, consumersand professionals dealing with these matters (Rev Med Chile 2004; 132: 1001-6).(

AB  - The study was undertaken on three adjacent rivers in NW Ireland, on one of which an Atlantic salmon Salmo salar freshwater juvenile rearing unit is situated. Two markers which distinguished farm and wild populations were used. An Ava II-B RFLP in the ND1 region of mtDNA was at a frequency of 0.58 in the farm strain but absent in the wild populations. Allele E at minisatellite locus Ssa- A45/2/l was at a frequency of 0.91 in farm samples, but at a maximum of 0.41 in the populations in the two rivers adjacent to the one with the juvenile rearing unit. The farm strain showed a significant reduction in mean heterozygosity (0.281 ± 0.057), over three minisatellite loci examined, compared to wild samples (0.532 ± 0.063). The occurrence of farm genotypes and the independent occurrence of mtDNA and minisatellite markers in several parr samples from the river indicated that escaped juvenile salmon completed their life cycle, bred and interbred with native fish, upon their return to the river. Escaped fish homed accurately, as adults, to the site of escape, i.e. the area adjacent to the hatchery outflow in the upstream part of the river. Breeding of males in the lower part of the river was also indicated but this could have been due to mature male parr which had moved downstream. The return of adults of farm origin to the river to breed was indicated by the presence of the Ava II-B haplotype in adults netted in the estuary.

AB  - Aquaculture is currently the fastest expanding global animal food production sector and is a key future contributor to food security. An increase in food security will be dependent upon the development and improvement of sustainable practices. A prioritization exercise was undertaken, focusing on the future knowledge needs to underpin UK sustainable aquaculture (both domestic and imported products) using a ‘task force’ group of 36 ‘practitioners’ and 12 ‘research scientists’ who have an active interest in sustainable aquaculture. A long list of 264 knowledge needs related to sustainable aquaculture was developed in conjunction with the task force. The long list was further refined through a three stage process of voting and scoring, including discussions of each knowledge need. The top 25 knowledge needs are presented, as scored separately by ‘practitioners’ or ‘research scientists’. There was similar agreement in priorities identified by these two groups. The priority knowledge needs will provide guidance to structure ongoing work to make science accessible to practitioners and help to prioritize future science policy needs and funding. The process of knowledge exchange, and the mechanisms by which this can be achieved, effectively emerged as the top priority for sustainable aquaculture. Viable alternatives to wild fish-based aquaculture feeds, resource constraints that will potentially limit expansion of aquaculture, sustainable offshore aquaculture and the treatment of sea lice also emerged as strong priorities. Although the exercise was focused on UK needs for sustainable aquaculture, many of the emergent issues are considered to have global application.

AB  - Salmon farming is among the most successful aquaculture industries with a production growth that is substantially higher than aggregate aquaculture production in recent decades. It is well known that innovations and productivity growth are the main sources for this development. In this article we look closer at two potentially important factors in production growth, development of farm size and company size directly through economies of scale and indirectly through capacity in R&D, innovation, sales and marketing. In Norway, production per license has increased from 26 tons in 1980 to 1,130 tons in 2010, suggesting a substantial intensification in the industry. In all five leading salmon producing countries, the degree of concentration has increased and the large firms have become bigger over time.

AB  - Global production of farmed fish and shellfish has more than doubled in the past 15 years. Many people believe that such growth relieves pressure on ocean fisheries, but the opposite is true for some types of aquaculture. Farming carnivorous species requires large inputs of wild fish for feed. Some aquaculture systems also reduce wild fish supplies through habitat modification, wild seedstock collection and other ecological impacts. On balance, global aquaculture production still adds to world fish supplies; however, if the growing aquaculture industry is to sustain its contribution to world fish supplies, it must reduce wild fish inputs in feed and adopt more ecologically sound management practices.

AB  - By means of surveys in 48 salmon farms in Chile, and the analysis of fish mortality in 23, the results showed that attacks by the South American sea lion, Otaria flavescens, were periodical at a daily and seasonal scale, and because of their natural nocturnal feeding behaviour, were more frequent at night and in fall–winter seasons. The attacks varied markedly between the farms studied. No relation was found between the intensity of attacks, the distance to the nearest colony of sea lions and the population in the colony. Differences found between farms could be because of the different protective devices used, namely anti-predator nets, acoustic harassment devices (AHDs) and fibreglass models of killer whales, and the way in which they were used. Of these devices, only the anti-predator net achieved a permanent reduction in sea lion attacks. Both AHDs and fibreglass killer whales were inefficient in the short term.

AB  - Surveillance of bacterial susceptibility to five antimicrobial agents was performed during a 1-year period in and around four freshwater fish farms situated along a stream in western Denmark. Besides assessing the levels of antibiotic resistance among the culturable fraction of microorganisms in fish, water, and sediment samples, two major fish pathogens (88 Flavobacterium psychrophilum isolates and 134 Yersinia ruckeri isolates) and 313 motile Aeromonas isolates, representing a group of ubiquitous aquatic bacteria, were isolated from the same samples. MICs were obtained applying a standardized agar dilution method. A markedly decreased susceptibility of F. psychrophilum isolates to most antimicrobial agents presently available for use in Danish aquaculture was detected, while the collected Y. ruckeri isolates remained largely sensitive to all therapeutic substances. Comparing the inlet and outlet samples, the increase of the antibiotic-resistant proportions observed among the culturable microflora was more pronounced and statistically significant among the motile aeromonads. High levels of individual and multiple antimicrobial resistances were demonstrated within the collected flavobacteria and aeromonads, thus indicating a substantial impact of fish farming on several groups of bacteria associated with aquacultural environments.

AB  - <jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold>Global production of farmed salmon and trout in saltwater was 1.82 million metric tons in 2007, three times more than any other farmed marine fish category. Development of this industry teaches that, for fish farming to succeed, containment systems must be easily
 deployed and operated and governments must create space in their coastal waters where farms can be located. Neither of these circumstances exists presently in the United States and, until this changes, other lessons that salmon farming teaches can only provide research or policy guidance.
 These include the importance of selecting a good fish to farm and making them “affordable” by being efficient. Salmon farmers achieved the latter through mechanization, industry scale, and a focus on good fish health and performance.Salmon farming also teaches that various
 plant and animal ingredients can be used in salmon feed and that its future growth will not be limited because salmon is a carnivore, as some have suggested. In fact, carnivorous fish, such as salmon, may turn out to be some of the most ecologically efficient species to farm. It is noteworthy,
 too, that it took 40 years to establish an industry with the capacity to produce 1.82 million metric tons of fish per year while the United States imported 2.36 million metric tons of seafood in 2008, 83% of its needs, much of it from foreign farms. If future international competition for
 these same supplies leads to national seafood shortages, it will be hard to replace it quickly with products from domestic aquaculture.</jats:p>

AB  - A threshold of lethal infection was estimated from previous controlled laboratory expo- sures to be 7.5 Lepeophtheirus salmonis g -1 for pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha averaging <0.7 g. This threshold was used to assess the risk of mortality caused by L. salmonis among pink salmon of the same size class in the Broughton Archipelago, Canada from 2005 to 2008. Virtually all (≥98.9%) pink salmon collected in late March belonged to this size class, and this proportion declined to ≤1% by early July. The proportion of these small pink salmon with infections equal to or exceed- ing the threshold declined from 4.5 in 2005 to 0% in 2008, coincident with an overall decline in par- asite prevalence and intensity during this period. In 2005 and 2006, this proportion was greatest in March (7.8 and 1.1%, respectively) whereas in 2007, the proportion exceeding the threshold was greatest in May (2.9%). In 2008, no infections exceeded the threshold. Parasite development co- incided with fish migration through the study area. The declining risk between 2005 and 2008 was possibly related to changes in ocean conditions such as temperature, to changing treatment practices for this parasite on salmon farms, or to changes in the abundance or distribution of non-farmed hosts. The concept of a threshold of L. salmonis infection density may be used to assist in the management and conservation of juvenile pink salmon in the Broughton Archipelago region.

AB  - In the hatchery environment, there is no selection by predators against risky foraging behaviour and excessive aggressiveness. Consequently, hatchery-reared trout should have a higher competitive ability and a less pronounced antipredator response than wild trout. Growth hormone increases the energy demand and thereby the feeding motivation of an animal. Therefore, growth hormone injections should reduce the antipredator response and promote competitive ability. Both hatchery selection and growth hormone injection consistently reduced antipredator behavioural responses in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the presence of a trout predator. However, neither hatchery selection nor growth hormone had any effect on dominance or quantity of contested food consumed, whereas both hatchery selection and growth hormone injection promoted growth. RNA levels were increased by growth hormone, and hatchery-reared trout had lower RNA levels than wild trout. The presence of the predator increased RNA levels in the trout independent of strain and treatment. Our study suggests that antipredator behaviour, growth rate, and resource allocation patterns in brown trout change rapidly as a consequence of hatchery selection and that similar changes in antipredator behaviour can be induced by increasing GH levels. Thus, released or escaped hatchery-reared fish or fish with manipulated growth hormone levels with altered behaviour patterns may pose a potential threat to wild populations. Resume : Dans un milieu diOlevage, il niy a pas de sOlection par les prOdateurs qui Olimine le comportement dialimentation ‡ risque ni liagressivitO excessive. En consOquence, les truites diOlevage devraient prOsenter une compOtitivitO plus OlevOe, et une rOaction antiprOdateur moins prononcOe que les truites sauvages. Lihormone de croissance augmente la demande diOnergie et donc la motivation ‡ sialimenter diun animal. Les injections de cette hormone devraient donc rOduire la rOaction antiprOdateur et promouvoir la compOtitivitO. De faAon rOgulire, la sOlection en Olevage et liinjection dihormone de croissance ont bien rOduit les rOactions comportementales antiprOdateur chez les juvOniles de truite brune (Salmo trutta) en prOsence diun prOdateur. Toutefois, ni la sOlection ni liinjection dihormones niavaient dieffet sur la dominance ou la quantitO consommOe de la nourriture contestOe, tandis que les deux interventions avaient un effet favorable sur la croissance. Le taux diARN Otait accru par lihormone, et les truites diOlevage prOsentaient des taux diARN plus faibles que les truites sauvages. La prOsence du prOdateur faisait monter le taux diARN chez les truites, indOpendamment de la souche et du traitement. Notre Otude permet de penser que le comportement antiprOdateur, le taux de croissance et le mode diallocation des ressources chez les truites brunes changent rapidement par suite de la sOlection piscicole, et que des changements similaires dans le comportement antiprOdateur peuvent Œtre induits par une augmentation du taux dihormone de croissance. Les poissons libOrOs ou OvadOs des Ocloseries ou manipulOs par injection dihormone de croissance et prOsentant une modification comportementale peuvent donc constituer une menace pour les populations sauvages.

AB  - Gyrodactylus salaris (Monogenea, Platyhelminthes) is a notifiable freshwater pathogen responsible for causing catastrophic damage to wild Atlantic salmon stocks, most notably in Norway. In some strains of Baltic salmon (e.g., from the river Neva) however, the impact is greatly reduced due to some form of innate resistance that regulates parasite numbers, resulting in fewer host mortalities. Gyrodactylus salaris is known from 17 European states; its status in a further 35 states remains unknown; the UK, the Republic of Ireland and certain watersheds in Finland are free of the parasite. Thus, the parasite poses a serious threat if it emerges in Atlantic salmon rearing regions throughout Europe. At present, infections are generally controlled via extreme measures such as the treatment of entire river catchments with the biocide rotenone, in order to remove all hosts, before restocking with the original genetic stock. The use of rotenone in this way in EU countries is unlikely as it would be in contravention of the Water Framework Directive. Not only are such treatments economically and environmentally costly, they also eradicate the potential for any host/parasite evolutionary process to occur. Based on previous studies, UK salmon stocks have been shown to be highly susceptible to infection, analogous to Norwegian stocks. The present study investigates the impact of a G. salaris outbreak within a naive salmon population in order to determine long-term consequences of infection and the likelihood of coexistence. Simulation of the salmon/ G. salaris system was carried out via a deterministic mathematical modelling approach to examine the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions. Results indicated that in order for highly susceptible Atlantic strains to evolve a resistance, both a moderate-strong deceleratingly costly trade-off on birth rate and a lower overall cost of the immune response are required. The present study provides insights into the potential long term impact of G. salaris if introduced into G. salaris-free territories and suggests that in the absence of external controls salmon populations are likely to recover to high densities nearing 90% of that observed pre-infection.

AB  - A new technique is proposed for deriving the risk preference function under production risk and expected utility of profit maximization. The derivation depends on neither a specific parametric form of the utility function nor any distribution of the error term representing production risk. The proposed risk preference function is flexible enough to test different types of risk behavior and symmetry of the output distribution. Furthermore, our production risk specification allows for inputs with positive and negative marginal risk. The econometric model accommodates production risk, risk preferences and firm heterogeneity simultaneously. Norwegian salmon farming data are used as an application.

AB  - Summary The impact of salmon farming on the environment has been widely studied; there is, however, no consensus on the magnitude and quality of these effects and little information on their extent over large salmon farming areas. Forty-three salmon farm sites of which 29 are in full operation and grouped in nine locations in southern Chile were evaluated. Using statistical methods (two-way ANOVA), no effects were found on water column variables such as nitrate, ammonia, orthophosphate and chlorophyll, whereas they were significant on sediment variables such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and organic carbon (OC), among others. Natural variability evaluation of some parameters revealed that P in sediments had the lowest coefficient of variation (23.2%) when compared with N (65.2%), particulate organic matter (POM) (139%) and OC (39%), and showed more marked salmon farming effects with no locality effects. Four of the nine locations showed stronger effects on sediments, with average P values ranging from 150 to 230 mmol that were six to nine times higher than in control sites (25 mmol). Nitrogen and carbon in sediments, while showing significant effects on salmon farming, also showed locality effects that revealed other biogenic processes influencing sediment composition. Thus, P in sediments was proposed as a promising indicator of impact on salmon farming, although the relationship with fauna in sediments was not linear and somewhat variable; more research is therefore needed to understand such connections. Considering entire geographical locations, no relationship was found between sediment conditions under salmon cages and the condition of the water column at a farm. This may indicate the possibility of high dilution rates and recycling processes, which so far preclude the detection of more global impacts beyond the cages shadow.

AB  - As is well known, optimal levels of both homeostasis and welfare of farmed fish are almost completely dependent upon human endeavour to investigate fish brain capacities and utilize them for the greatest benefit. According to the accumulated research experience specifically concerning minimization of farmed fish stress, the final outcome of the involved mechanisms is strongly associated with fish species and biological stage as well as a number of rearing environment parameters related to the type of the production system applied.



Based on the conclusions gained, it is clear that the fish brain-neuroendocrinological system is an extraordinarily rich and expressive one forming a species-specific living ethology that incorporates cognitive behaviour and ‘demands’, the whole constituting, in effect, the fish “personality”. The diverse facets of this ‘personality’ are expressed via a wide range of phenomena: e.g. the power of learning, memorizing, sound production, particular external coloration changes, courtship behaviour, parent care and “emotional feelings” including the manifestation of aggressiveness and the demonstration of “happiness”. The final conclusion to be drawn is that fish are indeed amazing creatures. One can only marvel at the superb plasticity of their brain which, over hundreds of millions of years and through myriad genomic, evolutionary and epigenetic developments, has enabled them to adapt and respond to and remarkably thrive in all extremes of environments, and all this though they lack a cerebral neocortex.

AB  - Until recently fish welfare attracted little attention, but international and national legislation and standards of fish welfare are now emerging and an overview of these developments is presented in this study. Whereas animal welfare legislation is based on public morality, animal ethics does not automatically accept public morality as normative and elaborates arguments regarding the way humans should treat animals (referred to as moral standards). In this study we present the most common animal ethics theories. For most of these, sentience is considered a demarcation line for moral concern: if an animal is sentient, then it should be included in the moral circle, i.e. receive moral consideration in its own right and some basic welfare should be ensured. As for fish, research has revealed that the sensory system of teleosts can detect noxious stimuli, and that some kind of phenomenal consciousness, allowing the fish to feel pain, seems to be present. This raises the ethical question as to how much evidence we need in order to act on such indications of fish sentience. A simple risk analysis shows that the probability that fishes can feel pain is not negligible and that if they do indeed experience pain the consequences in terms of the number of suffering individuals are great. We conclude that farmed fish should be given the benefit of the doubt and we should make efforts that their welfare needs are met as well as possible. Finally, the way forward is briefly discussed: efforts must be made to understand what fish welfare means in practical fish farming. This will involve the development of research and education, greater accountability and transparency, compliance with and control of policies, and quality assurance schemes.

AB  - Many parasites are transmitted trophically, whereas others can either succumb to, or escape from, the predators of their hosts. We examined the extent to which larval arrenurid water mites (Arrenurus planus Marshall, 1908 and Arrenurus pollictus Marshall, 1910) parasitizing lestid damselflies (Lestes forcipatus Rambur, 1842 and Lestes disjunctus Selys, 1862) escape from predatory libellulid dragonflies that are consuming their hosts. We hypothesized that the brightly coloured mites would be avoided by feeding dragonflies. However, all partially engorged A. pollictus mites were eaten while their host was being consumed in staged predation trials. In contrast, half of the fully engorged mites detached and therefore escaped consumption. Trials with A. planus mites showed that they detached more readily than their congenerics, which may be due to selection on those temporary pond mites to survive desiccation stress following detachment. The effect of dragonfly predation on transitioning of mites from parasiti...

AB  - The agricultural world today is dominated by a few domesticated mammal species, that is, animals modified from their wild ancestors through selective breeding in captivity for traits beneficial to human usages. As a result, a clear dichotomy exists between wild (from hunting) and domesticated mammals (produced in farms) used for human consumption. Similar to agriculture, aquaculture is often viewed as the only solution that can provide more fish products given that harvesting wild stocks have reached an upper limit. Aquaculture is considerably younger than agriculture relying on natural sources to farm numerous species. To better describe the diverse strategies for fish production, we propose a new classification comprising five levels of `domestication' with 1 being the least to 5 being the most domesticated. Our classification places 70% of the 250 farmed finfish species recorded in the 2009 FAO database into levels 1, 2 and 3 representing a transitory form of fish production dependent on the availability of the wild resource. In contrast, only a few species, or more accurately populations, can be considered truly domesticated, similar to cattle or sheep. Based on this classification, two scenarios for the future of aquaculture are discussed: either the industry focuses on few truly domesticated species, similar to the path taken by agriculture, but avoiding its negative impacts or aquaculture proceeds with inter-specific diversification by focusing primarily on the domestication of native species.

AB  - The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts commodity production and prices around the world. This study revisits fishmeal–soya bean meal price ratio dynamics and examines it in relation to the ENSO anomalies. A smooth transition autoregressive modelling framework is applied to assess nonlinearities in the ENSO–price ratio relationship, and generalised impulse–response functions and derived asymmetry functions are utilised to illustrate characteristic features of the estimated model dynamics. The results suggest economically meaningful impacts of ENSO on the price ratio dynamics, and indicate statistical significance of these effects for up to one year after the ENSO shocks.

AB  - We develop a model of a multi-national firm producing commodities for a global market in multiple locations with location-specific risks and different regulatory standards. Salmon aquaculture and disease outbreaks provide an empirically relevant example. We specifically examine details of the infectious salmon anemia outbreak in Chile in the late 2000s, the multi-national nature of some firms operating in Chile, and the overall market structure of the salmon farming industry as motivation for our theoretical model. In the model, market structure and the regulatory environments in multiple countries interact to influence how intensively firms use aquatic ecosystems. Downward-sloping market demand can lead to a perverse outcome in which high environmental standards in one country both lower the provision of disease management in the other country and reduce industry-wide output. We extend this model to consider additional locations, types of firms, and within-location risk spillovers. We find that the risk of outbreak in a given location is decreasing with greater firm concentration within the location, increasing with the outside production of operators within the location, and increasing with lower risk (or more regulation) in other locations where the operators produce. We suggest other applications of multi-national risk management.

AB  - It is generally accepted that resistance genes acquired by human pathogens through horizontal gene transfer originated in environmental, non-pathogenic bacteria. As a consequence, there is increasing concern on the roles that natural, non-clinical ecosystems, may play in the evolution of resistance. Recent studies have shown that the variability of determinants that can provide antibiotic resistance on their expression in a heterologous host is much larger than what is actually found in human pathogens, which implies the existence of bottlenecks modulating the transfer, spread, and stability of antibiotic resistance genes. In this review, the role that different factors such as founder effects, ecological connectivity, fitness costs, or second-order selection may have on the establishment of a specific resistance determinant in a population of bacterial pathogens is analyzed.

AB  - Offshore fish farming is predicted to increase in the near future driven by the lack of coastal space. In this review I discuss the environmental issues of offshore farming from experience in coastal farms. Even more so than in coastal farms, a rapid and wide dispersal of dissolved waste prod- ucts is predicted for offshore farms. Despite wider dispersal of particulate waste products, fast sinking rates of feed pellets and faeces suggest organic enrichment of the bottom sediments in farm vicinities (hundreds of meters), although at lower loading rates than coastal farms. The benthic response to organic enrichment is unpredictable due to lack of knowledge from shelf areas. Most shelf sediments are considered carbon limited and fish farm waste products may stimulate the benthic communities, but due to the sparse abundance and absence of pollutant-tolerant benthic fauna, the capacity of ben- thic communities to assimilate organic matter may be limited. Instead, microbial decomposition of waste products could become important, leading to increased oxygen demand and accumulation of sulfides in the sediments. This may negatively affect benthic biodiversity. Interactions with wild fish (aggregation, genetic impacts, spreading of disease and parasites) are expected, but difficult to pre- dict, as the composition of species attracted to offshore farms will be different from that of species attracted to coastal farms. Escapees are potentially a high risk due to farm failure under rough weather conditions in the open sea. The carbon footprint of farming offshore will increase (transportation) and the ecological footprint (fishing feed) will remain a severe constraint, as in coastal farming. Offshore farming is subject to high costs of operation, including those for monitoring environmental conditions. Research should focus on interactions with wild fish populations, mapping of sensitive benthic habitats and experimental studies of the response of benthic habitats to organic enrichments.

AB  - During the austral summer of 2002, theodolite tracking was used to evaluate Chilean dolphin (Cephalorhynchus eutropia) behavioural responses to boats in Yaldad Bay, southern Chile. This bay represents an important site for the occurrence of this species. Boat traffic has increased considerably since 1980 in this area due to aquaculture activities. Behavioural responses were analysed for each dolphin activity, and pre-, during, and post-boat encounters. When foraging and approached by a vessel, dolphins increased their reorientation rate, whereas swimming speed showed no significant change. When traveling, however, dolphins reacted to boats by increasing their directional swimming speed, while reorientation rate did not differ. After encounters, dolphins seemed to return quickly to previous behavioural patterns when traveling, whereas it took longer to establish normal patterns when foraging. Group dispersion analyses showed that when boats approached foraging dolphins, they became significantly more cohesively grouped. Consequently, dolphins reacted negatively to boat presence in Yaldad Bay, but these responses were conditional on dolphin behavioural activities prior to boat encounters. These findings emphasize the need to consider boat traffic disturbance on cetaceans in coastal management plans.

AB  - ABSTRACTFor an industry’s total competitiveness, it is important how the suppliers perform. In this respect, efficiency improvement in smolt production is highly important for the Norwegian salmon industry. Smolt is one of the key input factors in salmon farming. After feed, it makes up for the highest cost share. The objective of this research was to analyze the efficiency in Norwegian production of juvenile salmonids from 1988–2012. A special interest in this research was to investigate how the age of the firm affects the technological efficiency. This econometric analysis is undertaken in a stochastic cost frontier framework. The results indicate that significant technical inefficiency is present in smolt production, and that there exist productivity differences between regions. Furthermore, there seems to be a learning-by-doing effect in juvenile production because older firms perform slightly better than the new ones with respect to technical efficiency.

AB  - Electrophoretic studies of proteins remain a primary source of insight into genetic diversity in many species including the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, one of the most culturally and economically important fish species of the North Atlantic region. Since 1966, >350 scientific papers on protein variation have been published encompassing 25 000+ salmon from over 400 locations in >200 river systems across the species' distribution. Variation has been detected at 30% of the 110 protein loci screened, though most studies examine <40. The method has been applied largely to the investigation of population structure and differentiation, but work has also led to the systematic revision of the genus Salmo and remains the primary source of insight into hybridization in the wild with brown trout Salmo trutta. Spatial patterns of differentiation show temporal stability, both within and among river systems, and strongly support structuring of the species into river and tributary specific populations and the designation of European and North American populations as distinct sub-species. They also show widespread regional differentiation within both continents, beyond the marked subcontinental differences between Baltic Sea and Atlantic Ocean populations in Europe. Most of the differentiation probably reflects gene flow and founder events associated with colonization following the retreat of the glaciers from much of the species' modern range. However, variation at MEP-2* shows strong correlations with environmental temperature, both within and among rivers, and associations with phenotypic performance. This suggests selection is acting on the locus and provides compelling evidence for the local adaptation of populations. Protein studies have led to more population centred management of the species and have been exploited in the discrimination of regional stocks in mixed stock analysis in high seas fisheries, particularly in the Baltic Sea, and as markers for the assessment of stocking success. They have also advanced insight into how the genetic character of populations can be changed in cultivation and the potential impact of salmon aquaculture and stocking on wild populations. The method has been largely superseded by DNA based analyses, but the results remain highly relevant to Atlantic salmon management and conservation and are an irreplaceable data set for studying genetic stability of populations over time.

AB  - Agricultural intensification usually consists of changes in farming practice such that: (1) a greater proportion of the available land is intensively exploited; (2) a given area is used more often; or (3) the level of technological input is raised. In many cases, these spatial, temporal, and technological aspects of intensification are combined.

AB  - Knowledge of the prevalence of escaped farmed fishes in the wild is an essential first step to assessing the risk resulting from interactions between farmed and wild fishes. This is especially important in eastern North America, where Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture occurs near wild Atlantic salmon rivers and where many wild salmon popula- tions are severely depressed. Here, we review the literature on the incidence of escaped farmed salmon in eastern North American rivers, for which there has been no comprehensive compilation to date. Escaped farmed salmon have been found in 54 of 62 (87%) rivers investigated within a 300 km radius of the aquaculture industry since 1984, including 11 rivers that contain endangered salmon populations. Averaged among all investigations, the proportional representation of farmed salmon among adults entering the rivers from the sea was 9.2% (range 0% to 100%). Where data were sufficient to exam- ine temporal trends, farmed salmon proportions varied considerably over time, suggesting that escape events are episodic in nature. We conclude that escaped farmed salmon are sufficiently prevalent in eastern North American rivers to pose a potentially serious risk to the persistence of wild salmon populations, especially in those rivers that are adjacent to existing aquaculture sites.

AB  - Abstract Commercial salmon and trout farming has emerged as a major industry in Chile during the 1990s. Salmon is not a native species to Chile, still excellent climatic conditions are provided for farming. Since 1992 Chile has been the second largest producer of farmed salmon and trout in the world after Norway. This report reviews the development of the Chilean salmonid industry from its early stages until today with respect to production patterns, legislation and main markets. A cost comparison between Chilean and Norwegian farmed salmon is also provided. Finally, the international competitiveness and future challenges of the Chilean salmonid farming industry are analysed.

AB  - To examine the link between early experience and subsequent reproductive performance, we experimentally manipulated the early experience of Atlantic salmon (Sabno sola). Salmon of a common genetic background were reared as juveniles either naturally in the river or artificially in a hatchery (sea ranched), depriving them of river experience, and then allowed to grow to maturity naturally in the ocean. At maturity, the competitive and reproductive abilities of these fish were compared in four experiments quantifying reproductive success. Although levels of aggressive behavior were similar, the experience-deprived, searanched males were involved in more prolonged aggressive encounters and incurred greater wounding and mortality than wild males. Furthermore, sea-ranched males were less able to monopolize spawnings and as a result obtained 51% the reproductive success of wild males across the experiments. This reproductive inferiority varied directly with the male density and bias in the sex ratio, reflecting the intensity of male breeding competition. A lower intensity of female than male competition was likely responsible for the lack of differences in breeding performance between sea-ranched and wild females. Sea-ranched females, however, produced smaller eggs than wild females, apparently in response to their higher juvenile growth rate. Differences in migratory behavior were also apparent, as sea-ranched males and females ascended the River Imsa later than wild fish. Our results indicate that early experience has implications for subsequent adult reproductive performance, affecting the development of specialized skills and traits important not only for early life, but also later life.

AB  - Antimicrobial use in food animals selects for antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, which can spread to people. Reducing use of antimicrobials-particularly those deemed to be critically important for human medicine-in food production animals continues to be an important step for preserving the benefits of these antimicrobials for people. The World Health Organization ranking of antimicrobials according to their relative importance in human medicine was recently updated. Antimicrobials considered the highest priority among the critically important antimicrobials were quinolones, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, macrolides and ketolides, and glycopeptides. The updated ranking allows stakeholders in the agriculture sector and regulatory agencies to focus risk management efforts on drugs used in food animals that are the most important to human medicine. In particular, the current large-scale use of fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and third-generation cephalosporins and any potential use of glycopeptides and carbapenems need to be addressed urgently.

AB  - Deltamethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid pesticide that kills insects through dermal contact and digestion. It is applied for a range of commercial crops and recreational uses, and by extension controls a variety of pests. The cytological effects of deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid used as an insecticide, have been studied using root meristems of Allium cepa. Deltamethrin treatment resulted in a dose-related reduction in mitotic index. Both chromosomal and mitotic abnormalities were encountered at all concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2 ppm. Most of the chromosomal and mitotic abnormalities were apparently due to disturbance in the mitotic spindle. Induction of chromosome and chromatid breaks with higher concentrations (0.5 to 2.0 ppm) suggested clastogenic action of this compound but Deltamethrin is not mobile in the environment because of its strong adsorption on particles, its insolubility in water, and very low rates of application; however, it still presents risks to the ecosystem in which it is applied. The level of deltamethrin biodegradation in mixed cultures of benthic and planktonic bacteria after 5, 10, and 15 days of incubation was higher than that in homogenous cultures. It was demonstrated that microorganisms from the Sphingomonas paucimobilis species and the Moraxella genus, among planktonic bacteria, as well as Burkholderia cepacia and Bacillus mycoides species, among benthic bacteria, were the most effective in reducing the concentration of this insecticide

AB  - Rather than benefiting wild fish, industrial aquaculture may contribute to declines in ocean fisheries and ecosystems. Farm salmon are commonly infected with salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which are native ectoparasitic copepods. We show that recurrent louse infestations of wild juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), all associated with salmon farms, have depressed wild pink salmon populations and placed them on a trajectory toward rapid local extinction. The louse-induced mortality of pink salmon is commonly over 80% and exceeds previous fishing mortality. If outbreaks continue, then local extinction is certain, and a 99% collapse in pink salmon population abundance is expected in four salmon generations. These results suggest that salmon farms can cause parasite outbreaks that erode the capacity of a coastal ecosystem to support wild salmon populations.

AB  - Separate magnetic resonance images of water and fat of oil-in-water emulsions and cheese blocks were obtained using the chemical shift selective suppression technique. With this technique, the proton signals emitted from water can be readily separated from those emitted from fat in the same sample through a single experiment using magnetic resonance imaging. Relaxation compensation was made to improve the quality of suppression. The experiment using oil-in-water emulsions demonstrated an excellent linear relationship between the intensity of the signal and the concentrations of water or fat. Images of a cheese slice showing only water or fat revealed that moisture distribution was less uniform than was fat distribution. Moisture contents determined by the magnetic resonance imaging technique were very close to those obtained by the oven-drying method.

AB  - A central issue in animal welfare research is how to assess the welfare state of animals objectively and scientifically. I argue that this issue can be approached by asking two key questions: 1) is the animal physically healthy and 2) does the animal have what it wants? Behaviour is used to answer both of these questions. In the assessment of physical health, it can be used for clinical and pre-clinical diagnosis. In the assessment of what animals want, it has a major role through choice and preference testing. It is particularly important that applied ethologists develop methods for assessing welfare in situ--in the places where concern for animal welfare is greatest such as on farms and in zoos.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Nanotechnology involves the application of materials at the nanoscale to new products or processes. It is a rapidly growing industry currently worth billions of U.S. dollars, with many potential benefits to society. There are opportunities for the fisheries and aquaculture industries to use existing nanotechnologies, and also to develop new applications specific to the industry. The potential benefits of nanotechnology for fisheries and aquaculture need to be balanced against concerns for the environment and the occupational health of workers. The key points are as follows: • Man-made nanomaterials (NMs), sometimes called engineered NMs or manufactured NMs, are novel materials that have at least one dimension <100 nm or have a primary size in the 1‐100 nm range. These materials are produced in many different physical forms including nanoparticles (NPs), nanorods, nanotubes, nanospheres and nanowires. The major chemical classes include metallic NPs, carbon-based NMs [carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon fullerene spheres] and a wide variety of composites made of more than one chemical substance. The surfaces of NMs can also be functionalised to create many different chemistries. • Manufactured NMs are already used in consumer products and exposure modelling predicts environmental concentrations of ng l −1 to low μ gl −1 levels of NMs in surface waters. The long-term impact of these predicted concentrations on fishes is currently unclear, and chronic effects on the environment cannot be excluded. • Nanotechnology is already being applied in the food industry. Applications for fisheries could include nanopolymers and coatings to strengthen food packaging in order to protect delicate fish fillets. The shelf life of fish and shellfish may be improved with the use of antibacterial nanocoatings, and transparent polymer films that can help exclude oxygen from around the food product. Nanosensors on the food packaging can also be used to report the deterioration of the fish or shellfish. A public engagement programme is needed to ensure public confidence in the food uses of nanotechnology by the industry.

AB  - This article is grounded in public choice theory and develops a framework to explain how non-benevolent behavior on the part of public regulators and the resulting lack of collaboration between different agencies have been affecting aquaculture growth. Although regulators are assumed to work for the best interest of the people, they can have their own rational agendas; such as career advancement, self-aggrandizement and loyalty for a particular political ideology. We show that when officials are non-benevolent and agencies have unequal relative decision-making power, it is likely that a more powerful agency dictates policies in favor of its own agenda, even when such policies may not necessarily lead to optimal social welfare. In the case of aquaculture, higher relative power of a pro-environment agency leads to underdevelopment of the sector, as is the case in developed countries, whereas larger relative power of a pro-industry agency leads to higher growth, as is the case in developing countries.

AB  - Abstract As one of the few countries in Latin America to have reversed persistent losses in tree cover, Chile may hold important insights for forest transition theory. However, existing studies have not provided methodologically consistent analyses at sufficient temporal and spatial scales to properly assess the state of Chile's forest transition. In the current study, we generate high-resolution maps of Chilean land use change between 1986, 2001 and 2011. We couple remote sensing with a review of historic assessments of Chile's forest resources to document long-term trends in forest extent. This historical review identifies multiple discrete forest transitions throughout Chile's history. These fluctuations in forest clearing emphasize that the cultural, economic and political forces that precipitate forest transitions can all be reversed. The remote sensing analysis calls into question official statistics indicating an expansion of native forests between 1986 and 2011. We find that increases in forest cover were largely driven by the expansion of forest plantations, rather than through native forest regeneration. Plantation forests directly displaced native forests in many locations, especially during the 1986–2001 period. Nevertheless, declines in the rate of forest conversion during the 2001–2011 period suggest that plantations are beginning to ease pressure on native forests.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes are typically isolated by cloning from cultured bacteria or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from environmental samples. These methods do not access the potential reservoir of undiscovered antibiotic resistance genes harboured by soil bacteria because most soil bacteria are not cultured readily, and PCR detection of antibiotic resistance genes depends on primers that are based on known genes. To explore this reservoir, we isolated DNA directly from soil samples, cloned the DNA and selected for clones that expressed antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli. We constructed four libraries that collectively contain 4.1 gigabases of cloned soil DNA. From these and two previously reported libraries, we identified nine clones expressing resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics and one expressing tetracycline resistance. Based on the predicted amino acid sequences of the resistance genes, the resistance mechanisms include efflux of tetracycline and inactivation of aminoglycoside antibiotics by phosphorylation and acetylation. With one exception, all the sequences are considerably different from previously reported sequences. The results indicate that soil bacteria are a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes with greater genetic diversity than previously accounted for, and that the diversity can be surveyed by a culture-independent method.

AB  - Over the past two decades aquaculture has emerged as the preeminent source of salmon. The development and evolution of salmon aquaculture in Chile illustrates changes that have taken place to a greater or lesser extent in other salmon producing regions. Although initially comprised of small independent firms with heavy reliance on foreign technology and production inputs, the Chilean salmon aquaculture industry has evolved into a horizontally and vertically integrated complex of interdependent suppliers, producers, processors, distributors, and supporting entities. The structure and organization of industries evolve over time in response to changes in the price and availability of inputs, changes in the demand for outputs and output attributes, and changes in technology. The growing demand for traceability and assurance is a change in the demand for credence attributes. Firms that are able to organize to provide traceability and assurance at low cost will, ceteris paribus, have an advantage.

AB  - Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta are the world’s two most widespread exotic fishes, dominate the fish communities of most coldtemperate waters in the southern hemisphere and are implicated in the decline and extirpation of native fish species. Here, we provide the first direct comparison of the impacts of rainbow and brown trout on populations of a native fish by quantifying three components of exotic species impact: range, abundance and effect. We surveyed 54 small streams on the island of Chilo ´ e in Chilean Patagonia and found that the rainbow trout has colonized significantly more streams and has a wider geographic range than brown trout. The two species had similar postyearling abundances in allopatry and sympatry, and their abundances depended similarly on reach-level variation in the physical habitat. The species appeared to have dramatically different effects on native drift-feeding Aplochiton spp., which were virtually absent from streams invaded by brown trout but shared a broad sympatric range with rainbow trout. Within this range, the species’ post-yearling abundances varied independently before and after controlling for variation in the physical habitat. In the north of the island, Aplochiton spp. inhabited streams uninvaded by exotic trouts. Our results provide a context for investigating the mechanisms responsible for apparent differences in rainbow and brown trout invasion biology and can help inform conservation strategies for native fishes in Chilo ´ e and elsewhere.

AB  - ABSTRACT To gain insight into the diversity and origins of antibiotic resistance genes, we identified resistance genes in the soil in an apple orchard using functional metagenomics, which involves inserting large fragments of foreign DNA into Escherichia coli and assaying the resulting clones for expressed functions. Among 13 antibiotic-resistant clones, we found two genes that encode bifunctional proteins. One predicted bifunctional protein confers resistance to ceftazidime and contains a natural fusion between a predicted transcriptional regulator and a β-lactamase. Sequence analysis of the entire metagenomic clone encoding the predicted bifunctional β-lactamase revealed a gene potentially involved in chloramphenicol resistance as well as a predicted transposase. A second clone that encodes a predicted bifunctional protein confers resistance to kanamycin and contains an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase domain fused to a second acetyltransferase domain that, based on nucleotide sequence, was predicted not to be involved in antibiotic resistance. This is the first report of a transcriptional regulator fused to a β-lactamase and of an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase fused to an acetyltransferase not involved in antibiotic resistance.

AB  - The high level of escapes from Atlantic salmon farms, up to two million fishes per year in the North Atlantic, has raised concern about the potential impact on wild populations. We report on a two-generation experiment examining the estimated lifetime successes, relative to wild natives, of farm, F(1) and F(2) hybrids and BC(1) backcrosses to wild and farm salmon. Offspring of farm and "hybrids" (i.e. all F(1), F(2) and BC(1) groups) showed reduced survival compared with wild salmon but grew faster as juveniles and displaced wild parr, which as a group were significantly smaller. Where suitable habitat for these emigrant parr is absent, this competition would result in reduced wild smolt production. In the experimental conditions, where emigrants survived downstream, the relative estimated lifetime success ranged from 2% (farm) to 89% (BC(1) wild) of that of wild salmon, indicating additive genetic variation for survival. Wild salmon primarily returned to fresh water after one sea winter (1SW) but farm and 'hybrids' produced proportionately more 2SW salmon. However, lower overall survival means that this would result in reduced recruitment despite increased 2SW fecundity. We thus demonstrate that interaction of farm with wild salmon results in lowered fitness, with repeated escapes causing cumulative fitness depression and potentially an extinction vortex in vulnerable populations.

AB  - This paper, which follows the emergence of the salmon industry in the 1990s in Chiloe, Chile, demonstrates that factors restricting women’s participation in labor force and wage differences between women and men are related to the gender systems operating in Chiloe. Results indicate that these systems reflect the territory’s demographic and agrarian history and that local gender systems have a positive influence on women’s participation in the labor market, though this is not accompanied by decreased salary discrimination in the salmon industry. The implication is that territory-specific and gender factors must be considered in national employment policies.

AB  - A total of 77 124 Atlantic salmon post-smolts, representing 197 full-sib families produced by 149 males and 197 females, experienced a field challenge from infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), following transfer to three separate seawater sites. The first IPN mortality was observed 45 days after transfer, and the duration of the epidemic varied between 37 and 92 days among sites. Mortalities were traced to their parental families by PIT (Passive Integrated Transpondes) tag records and DNA genotyping. Full-sib family mean incidence of mortality was calculated for each family on each site. Heritabilities were estimated based on the heterogeneity of chi-square using incidence within half-sib families and the variance in incidence among full-sib families, both on the observed and underlying liability scale. The observed correlation among families across sites was used to estimate genetic correlations. The overall mortality rate was 10.8%, with only small differences between sites, ranging from 10.3% to 11.9%. Heritabilities on the liability scale were found to be moderate to strong, and ranged between 0.24 and 0.81, with a pooled estimate of 0.43, greater than is typically associated with disease traits. Genetic correlations among sites were all substantial, between 0.71 and 0.78, and indicated that a substantial component of the genetic variation displayed within sites was common to all. The results show that field challenges can yield very good genetic information on family differences in resistance, especially when replicated over sites, which may then be developed for use in selection for breeding strains of Atlantic salmon with greater resistance to IPN.

AB  - Environmental scientists play a key role in society's responses to environmental problems, and many of the studies they perform are intended ultimately to affect policy. The precautionary principle, proposed as a new guideline in environmental decision making, has four central components: taking preventive action in the face of uncertainty; shifting the burden of proof to the proponents of an activity; exploring a wide range of alternatives to possibly harmful actions; and increasing public participation in decision making. In this paper we examine the implications of the precautionary principle for environmental scientists, whose work often involves studying highly complex, poorly understood systems, while at the same time facing conflicting pressures from those who seek to balance economic growth and environmental protection. In this complicated and contested terrain, it is useful to examine the methodologies of science and to consider ways that, without compromising integrity and objectivity, research can be more or less helpful to those who would act with precaution. We argue that a shift to more precautionary policies creates opportunities and challenges for scientists to think differently about the ways they conduct studies and communicate results. There is a complicated feedback relation between the discoveries of science and the setting of policy. While maintaining their objectivity and focus on understanding the world, environmental scientists should be aware of the policy uses of their work and of their social responsibility to do science that protects human health and the environment. The precautionary principle highlights this tight, challenging linkage between science and policy.

AB  - Our previous studies showed that particular antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were enriched locally in sediments below fish farms in the Northern Baltic Sea, Finland, even when the selection pressure from antibiotics was negligible. We assumed that a constant influx of farmed fish feces could be the plausible source of the ARGs enriched in the farm sediments. In the present study, we analyzed the composition of the antibiotic resistome from the intestinal contents of 20 fish from the Baltic Sea farms. We used a high-throughput method, WaferGen qPCR array with 364 primer sets to detect and quantify ARGs, mobile genetic elements, and the 16S rRNA gene. Despite a considerably wide selection of qPCR primer sets, only 28 genes were detected in the intestinal contents. The detected genes were ARGs encoding resistance to sulfonamide (sul1), trimethoprim (dfrA1), tetracycline (tet(32), tetM, tetO, tetW), aminoglycoside (aadA1, aadA2), chloramphenicol (catA1), and efflux-pumps resistance genes (emrB, matA, mefA, msrA). The detected genes also included class 1 integron-associated genes (intI1, qacE∆1) and transposases (tnpA). Importantly, most of the detected genes were the same genes enriched in the farm sediments. This preliminary study suggests that feces from farmed fish contribute to the ARG enrichment in farm sediments despite the lack of contemporaneous antibiotic treatments at the farms. We observed that the intestinal contents of individual farmed fish had their own resistome compositions. Our result also showed that the total relative abundances of transposases and tet genes were significantly correlated (p-value = 0.001, R2 = 0.71). In addition, we analyzed the mucosal skin and gill filament resistomes of the farmed fish but only one multidrug-efflux resistance gene (emrB) was detected. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the resistome of farmed fish using a culture-independent method. Determining the possible sources of ARGs, especially mobilized ARGs, is essential for controlling the occurrence and spread of ARGs at fish farming facilities and for lowering the risk of ARG spread from the farms to surrounding environments.

AB  - AbstractDiseases are an important challenge in aquaculture. However, most of what is known about the effect of diseases comes from laboratory experiments. Using a farm-level data set containing sea lice infestation counts for all Norwegian salmon farms over an 84-month period, we empirically investigate the biological and economic impacts of observed levels of infective lice. Sea lice, a common ectoparasitic copepod of salmonids, have been shown to reduce fish growth and appetite and cause substantial costs to salmon farmers worldwide. Our results suggest that the percent of total biomass growth lost per production cycle due to average infestations varies from 3.62 to 16.55%, despite control, and depends on farm location. Using a discrete harvesting model, we simulate the economic impact on farm profits over typical cycles. An average infestation over a typical central region spring-release cycle generates damages of US$0.46 per kg of harvested biomass, equivalent to 9% of farm revenues. We estimate that ...

AB  - The worldwide growth of aquaculture has been accompanied by a rapid increase in therapeutic and prophylactic usage of antimicrobials including those important in human therapeutics. Approximately 80% of antimicrobials used in aquaculture enter the environment with their activity intact where they select for bacteria whose resistance arises from mutations or more importantly, from mobile genetic elements containing multiple resistance determinants transmissible to other bacteria. Such selection alters biodiversity in aquatic environments and the normal flora of fish and shellfish. The commonality of the mobilome (the total of all mobile genetic elements in a genome) between aquatic and terrestrial bacteria together with the presence of residual antimicrobials, biofilms, and high concentrations of bacteriophages where the aquatic environment may also be contaminated with pathogens of human and animal origin can stimulate exchange of genetic information between aquatic and terrestrial bacteria. Several recently found genetic elements and resistance determinants for quinolones, tetracyclines, and β-lactamases are shared between aquatic bacteria, fish pathogens, and human pathogens, and appear to have originated in aquatic bacteria. Excessive use of antimicrobials in aquaculture can thus potentially negatively impact animal and human health as well as the aquatic environment and should be better assessed and regulated.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Most farm assurance schemes in the UK at least, in part, aim to provide assurances to consumers and retailers of compliance with welfare standards. Inclusion of welfare outcome assessments into the relevant inspection procedures provides a mechanism to improve animal welfare within assurance schemes. In this study, taking laying hens as an example, we describe a process for dealing with the practical difficulties in achieving this in two UK schemes; Freedom Food and Soil Association. The key challenges arise from selecting the most appropriate measures, defining sampling strategies that are feasible and robust, ensuring assessors can deliver a consistent evaluation and establishing a mechanism to achieve positive change. After a consultation exercise and pilot study, five measures (feather cover, cleanliness, aggressive behaviour, management of sick or injured birds, and beak trimming) were included within the inspection procedures of the schemes. The chosen sampling strategy of assessing 50 birds without handling provided reasonable certainty at a scheme level but less certainty at an individual farm level. Despite the inherent limitations within a time and cost sensitive certification assessment, the approach adopted does provide a foundation for welfare improvement by being able to highlight areas of concern requiring attention, enabling schemes to promote the use of outcome scoring as a management tool, promoting the dissemination of relevant technical information in a timely manner and increasing the scrutiny of standards important for the welfare of the birds.</jats:p>

AB  - Chinook, Oncurhynchus tshawytscha, catches in the Strait of Georgia increased in the 1970s and reached maximum levels from 1976 to 1978. Catches then declined until they stabilized through regulation at levels approximately one-quarter of the 1976 to 1978 levels. The timing of the decline in catch was synchronous with an increase in the mean temperature of the Strait of Georgia, a decline in annual Fraser River flows, and an abrupt decrease in the marine survival of hatchery-reared chinook released into the Strait of Georgia. Surprisingly, the number of young chinook salmon (smolts) more than doubled over the period of declining catches compared with the number produced during the period of high catches. The increase in smolt abundance was a consequence of the production from hatcheries that was approximately equal to wild production.



We conclude that there was a change in the carrying capacity for chinook salmon in the Strait of Georgia in the late 1970s that contributed to the declines in abundance and that rebuilding stocks to the high abundance of the late 1970s is unlikely until the carrying capacity for chinook salmon changes either naturally or through manipulation. Although we did not separate density-dependent and density-independent effects on marine survival, the current total number of chinook smolts produced appears larger than required for the current marine carrying capacity.

AB  - The prophylactic and therapeutic use of tetracyclines in aquaculture has been shown to contribute to the spread of tetracycline resistance in the environment. In this work, the prevalence of four different tetracycline-resistance genes, tetA, tetC, tetH, and tetM, in sediments from four aquaculture farms and their surroundings in the Baltic Sea was monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The presence of three additional tetracycline-resistance genes (tetE, tetG, and tetW) was studied qualitatively by standard PCR, and the amount of bioavailable tetracyclines and total amounts of tetracycline and oxytetracycline in samples were also measured. None of the farms were using tetracycline at the time of the sampling and one of the farms had stopped all antibiotic use six years prior to the first sampling. Two of the farms were sampled over four successive summers and two were sampled once. Our results showed greater copy numbers of tetA, tetC, tetH, and tetM at the farms compared to pristine sites and demonstrated the presence of tetE, tetG, and tetW genes in the sediments under aquaculture farms at most sampling times. However, no resistance genes were found in samples collected 200 m from any of the farms. None of the samples contained therapeutically active concentrations of tetracyclines at any of the sampling times, suggesting that the increase in the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes is caused by the persistence of these genes in the absence of selection pressure.

AB  - Potential interactions between marine predators and humans arise in the southern coast of Chile where predator feeding and reproduction sites overlap with fisheries and aquaculture. Here, we assess the potential effects of intensive salmon aquaculture on food habits, growth, and reproduction of a common predator, the spiny dogfish—identified as Squalus acanthias via genetic barcoding. A total of 102 (89 females and 13 males) individuals were collected during winter and summer of 2013–2014 from the Chiloe Sea where salmon aquaculture activities are concentrated. The low frequency of males in our study suggests spatial segregation of sex, while immature and mature females spatially overlapped in both seasons. Female spiny dogfish showed a functional specialist behavior as indicated by the small number of prey items and the relative high importance of the austral hake and salmon pellets in the diet. Immature sharks fed more on pellets and anchovies than the larger hake-preferring mature females. Our results also indicate that spiny dogfish switch prey (anchovy to hake) to take advantage of seasonal changes in prey availability. Despite differences in the trophic patterns of S. acanthias due to the spatial association with intensive salmon farming, in this region, there appears to be no difference in fecundity or size at maturity compared to other populations. Although no demographic effects were detected, we suggest that a range of additional factors should be considered before concluding that intensive aquaculture does not have any impact on these marine predators.

AB  - The spread of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) from salmon farms probably contributes to declines of some native Pacific salmon populations. Migration normally protects juvenile wild Pacific salmon from the marine ectoparasite in coastal waters by separating juvenile salmon from infected wild adults that are located offshore. Farmed salmon populations dwarf natural coastal host populations, particularly in winter, leading to biomagnification of louse populations. By spring, there may be large numbers of lice on farmed salmon, and this is associated with recurrent parasite infestations of wild juvenile salmon and depressed wild salmon stocks. Abiotic (eg temperature and salinity), biotic (eg predator abundance and food availability), and management (eg periodically emptying farms and applying chemical parasiticides) factors are thought to mediate the louse threat, but none have been well studied. Policy is needed that protects undeveloped juvenile salmon habitats and that supports long-term study of salmon ecosystems, to evaluate the sustainability of wild and farmed salmon.

AB  - During heavy storms in 1994–1995, salmon farms in southern Chile lost several million fish from the most commonly farmed species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). To determine the abundance and distribution of such exotic salmon populations in the wild and their effect on native organisms, we conducted experimental fishing, in six locations in the salmon farming regions (41°–46° S) in the inner seas of Chiloe (X Region) and Aysen (XI Region), between November 1995 and December 1996. At the same time, we collected information from salmon farms and insurance companies about escaped individuals. During the experimental fishing we captured 2602 coho salmon, 984 trout, and 271 Atlantic salmon. Captures of the three species declined through the duration of the study; thus in November 1996 we captured <10% of initial catches. Population projections based on three possible mortality rates (0.4, 0.8, and 1.2) predicted the disappearance of salmon by year 2000, and the highest mortality rate was the best predictor of the observed available biomass in 1996. Thus, artisanal fishing may control escaped salmon. Of the three species, coho salmon had the best chances of becoming established in the remote XI Region where the artisanal fishing pressure was less intense.

The three salmon species showed feeding similarities, since each kept feeding on pellets beneath the farms, particularly Atlantic salmon, while coho salmon showed greater preference for schooling fish, and rainbow trout fed more often on crustaceans. Thus, the three species, particularly coho salmon, could compete with native southern hake and mackerel. As a management approach to avoid salmon colonization and naturalization in southern Chile, local artisanal fishing should be encouraged because it is probably the most efficient way to remove escaped individuals and reduce the chance of populations becoming self-sustaining.

AB  - Since the mid-1980s, the Chilean salmon industry has steadily increased its annual production, propelled by a rapidly growing world demand for seafood (Montero 2004). The rapid expansion in production volume came hand in hand with the development of new institutions and new forms of social interaction among industry associations, universities, research institutions and other bodies. However, we can also observe that even at this incipient stage, there were already some imbalances in the co-evolutionary process. Chile achieved a successful ‘catch up’ in terms of nearing the production capacity of Norway (the largest exporter of salmon in the world) at the beginning of the first decade of the 2000s. However, this catch up was not comprehensive in all areas, particularly when we consider the aspects of innovation, development of local technological capabilities, sustainable production via monitoring of sanitation and environmental conditions, and overall institutions in general. Thus the process of industrial growth might not have been as successful as first impressions would suggest.

AB  - Time scales, and the trophic relations between these scales, are very different in the sea from those on land. In particular, marine systems are much more responsive to decadal scale alterations in their physical environment but are also much more adaptable. Thus it is difficult, and probably counterproductive, to try to define a baseline state for marine ecosystems. Further, regime shifts in fish communities can have major economic consequences without being ecological disasters. Climatic changes at decadal scales, from natural or anthropogenic causes, are likely to produce or enhance regime shifts. There are different management issues in different sectors. The coastal zone demands our intervention to assure integrated management of the land and sea components. At the other extreme, our understanding of open ocean systems is an essential element of climate prediction and so of eventual management. Between these two environments, our use of resources in continental shelf seas requires an ability to distinguish between human and natural causes of long-term change.

AB  - Carrying capacity is defined as the maximum biomass of a farmed species that can be supported without violating the maximum acceptable impacts to the farmed stock and its environment. Maximum acceptable impacts on the farmed stock and the environment are expressed by standards for water quality in the farm and the surrounding environment. Environmental quality standards are established in a political process. The scientific part of the problem to estimate the carrying capacity is to develop reliable, objective methods or models for estimating the response of both the environment and the farmed stock to farming. Using such models together with field observations from a specified locality and the quality standards in force, the carrying capacity for the locality can be estimated. Models must properly deal with hydrodynamic and biogeochemical and ecological processes in the environment as well as with oxygen consumption and sources and sinks of organic matter and nutrients due to farm activity. In this paper, the basic principles of model construction are discussed and the Norwegian MOM model is used as an example. Current speed data and farm activity data are identified as two generally large sources of uncertainty in estimates of environmental impact and carrying capacity.

AB  - The consequences of bacterial infections have been curtailed by the introduction of a wide range of antibiotics. However, infections continue to be a leading cause of mortality, in part due to the evolution and acquisition of antibiotic-resistance genes. Antibiotic misuse and overprescription have created a driving force influencing the selection of resistance. Despite the problem of antibiotic resistance in infectious bacteria, little is known about the diversity, distribution and origins of resistance genes, especially for the unculturable majority of environmental bacteria. Functional and sequence-based metagenomics have been used for the discovery of novel resistance determinants and the improved understanding of antibiotic-resistance mechanisms in clinical and natural environments. This review discusses recent findings and future challenges in the study of antibiotic resistance through metagenomic approaches.

AB  - Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is an orthomyxoviral disease, primarily affecting marine-phase farmed Atlantic salmon, which can result in high levels of mortality. ISA first emerged in Norway in the 1980s and subsequently has occurred in Canada, the USA, the Faeroe Islands and Chile. An outbreak occurred in Scotland in 1998-1999, but was eradicated at a cost of over pounds sterling 20M. The epidemiology of a new outbreak of ISA in the Scottish Shetland Islands during 2008-2009 is described. Six sites have been confirmed ISA-positive. Spread of the virus via transport of fish between marine sites, harvest vessels, smolts and wild fish appears to have been of little or no importance, with spread primarily associated with marine water currents. The use of management areas by Marine Scotland to control the event appears to have been effective in restricting spread to a small area. This localised outbreak contrasts with the 1998-1999 outbreak that spread over a wide geographic area with transported fish and harvest vessels. The development and application of industry codes of good practice, good husbandry and biosecurity practices, limited marine site-to-site movement of live fish and improved disinfection of vessels and processing plant waste that occurred subsequent to the 1998-1999 outbreak may explain the localised spread of infection in 2008-2009. Depopulation of confirmed sites has been achieved within 7 wk (mean = 3.7 wk); however, it is likely that subclinical infection persisted undetected for months on at least 1 site. The origin of the 2008-2009 outbreak remains unknown. Potential sources include evolution from a local reservoir of infection or importation. Synchronous fallowing of management areas, with good husbandry and biosecurity, reduces the risk of ISA recurring. Movement of fish between sites in different management areas represents the greatest risk of regional-scale spread, should this occur.

AB  - In the debate about sustainable development, the key question is whether natural capital can be substituted by man-made capital. Proponents of weak sustainability maintain that man-made and natural capital are substitutable in the long term whilst followers of strong sustainability believe they are not. This insightful book assesses whether science can unambiguously endorse either paradigm and explores the extent to which, and at what cost, certain forms of natural capital should be preserved. The book explores the limits of the two opposing paradigms of sustainability in an accessible and illuminating way. The author begins by examining the availability of natural resources for the production of consumption goods and the environmental consequences of economic growth. He also identifies the critical forms of natural capital in need of preservation given risk, uncertainty and ignorance about the future, and addresses the important topic of sustainability indicators. In doing so, he analyses indicators of weak sustainability such as Genuine Savings and the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, and indicators of strong sustainability including ecological footprints, material flows, sustainability gaps and other measures which combine the setting of environmental standards with monetary valuation. For the most part, requiring only a basic knowledge and understanding of economics, this accessible book will ensure the important theoretical and empirical debates surrounding sustainable development are available for a wide audience including undergraduate and postgraduate students of environmental and ecological economics. It will also be of interest to researchers and policymakers involved in the sustainable management of environmental resources.

Despite the apparent overlap between soil and clinical resistomes, factors influencing ARG composition in soil and their movement between genomes and habitats remain largely unknown. General metagenome functions often correlate with the underlying structure of bacterial communities. However, ARGs are proposed to be highly mobile, prompting speculation that resistomes may not correlate with phylogenetic signatures or ecological divisions. To investigate these relationships, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 18 antibiotics from 18 agricultural and grassland soils. The 2,895 ARGs we discovered were mostly new, and represent all major resistance mechanisms. We demonstrate that distinct soil types harbour distinct resistomes, and that the addition of nitrogen fertilizer strongly influenced soil ARG content. Resistome composition also correlated with microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structure, both across and within soil types. Consistent with this strong correlation, mobility elements (genes responsible for horizontal gene transfer between bacteria such as transposases and integrases) syntenic with ARGs were rare in soil by comparison with sequenced pathogens, suggesting that ARGs may not transfer between soil bacteria as readily as is observed between human pathogens. Together, our results indicate that bacterial community composition is the primary determinant of soil ARG content, challenging previous hypotheses that horizontal gene transfer effectively decouples resistomes from phylogeny.

AB  - Aquaculture has become an important source of fish available for human consumption. In order to achieve greater productivity, intensive fish cultivation systems are employed, which can cause greater susceptibility to diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Antimicrobial substances are compounds used in livestock production with the objectives of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms and treatment or prevention of diseases. It is well recognized that the issues of antimicrobial use in food animals are of global concern about its impact on food safety. This paper present an overview of the aquaculture production in the whole world, raising the particularities in Brazil, highlighting the importance of the use of veterinary drugs in this system of animal food production, and address the potential risks arising from their indiscriminate use and their impacts on aquaculture production as they affect human health and the environment. The manuscript also discusses the analytical methods commonly used in the determination of veterinary drug residues in fish, with special issue for fluroquinolones residues and with emphasis on employment of LC-MS/MS analytical technique.

AB  - Spectral analysis of twenty-one climate records indicates that NE Pacific temperatures and winter wind stress have fluctuated at four dominant time scales in this century: 2–3 years (quasi-biennial oscillation), 5–7 years (El Nino-Southern Oscillation, ENSO), 20–25 years (bidecadal oscillation, BDO), and a poorly resolved, very-low-frequency (VLF) oscillation with a 50–75 year period. Forty-four per cent of the low-frequency variability in British Columbia air temperatures is associated with the strength of the Aleutian Low pressure system in winter. Only 42% of the ‘strong’ and 25% of the ‘moderate’ ENSO events in this century have produced large warm anomalies off BC. Interactions between the ENSO, bidecadal and very-low-frequency oscillations produce a pattern of alternating warm and cool climate states, with major warnings every 50 to 75 years. Since 1850 there have been seven warm periods, lasting an average of 11.4 years, and six cool periods lasting an average of 10.8 years. Sharp transitions from cool to warm climate states (as in 1977/78) occur when warming phases of the BDO and VLF oscillations coincide. Recent evidence suggests that the BDO may originate in either the tropical or the subtropical North Pacific. The NE Pacific has experienced a major warming since 1978. A long-range forecast suggests that the BDO and VLF oscillations peaked in 1989 and are currently in a cooling phase. Consequently, coastal temperatures should moderate for the rest of this century. A transition to the next cool climate state could occur about the year 2001. The forecast for moderating temperatures could begin the first phase of the recovery of the southern BC coastal chinook and coho salmon and herring stocks, which are currently at low abundance levels.

AB  - Juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were raised in six ponds at Rosewall Creek, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, from which releases were made at four times: April 14, May 12, June 10 and July 8, 1975. Prior to each release a portion of the juveniles in each pond were graded into three size groups (small, medium, large) based on size distributions in each pond. The juveniles were nose-tagged according to size group, pond, and release date, and marked by adipose fin removal. A total of 57 groups were released. Returns of adults and precocious males (jacks) to the weir and to the fishery (commercial, sport) were subjected to response surface analysis. Maximum adult returns of 43.5%, to the weir and fishery, were predicted for release of 25.1-g coho juveniles on the 173rd (Julian) day from January 1 (June 22, 1975). A significant interaction was noted between release time and size: maximum returns from early (April 14) releases would be expected from release of 16- to 17-g juveniles. Returns of ja...

AB  - This paper investigates whether two lines of rainbow trout displaying genetically determined variation in stress responsiveness and behavior also show differences in brain monoaminergic activity. In several brain regions, strains of rainbow trout selected for consistently high or low post-stress cortisol levels displayed differences in tissue concentrations of monoamines and/or monoamine metabolites, or in metabolite/monoamine ratios. High-responsive trout reacted to stress by an increase in the concentrations of both serotonin (brain stem), dopamine (brain stem), and norepinephrine (optic tectum, telencephalon), whereas low-responsive fish did not. Brain stem and optic tectum concentrations of monoamine metabolites were also elevated after stress in high responders, but not in low-responsive fish. The simultaneous increase in the concentration of monoamines and their metabolites suggests that both synthesis and metabolism of these transmitters were elevated after stress in high-responsive trout. A divergent pattern was seen in the hypothalamus, where low-responsive fish displayed elevated levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a serotonin metabolite) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (a norepinephrine metabolite). In the telencephalon, both populations had elevated concentrations of these metabolites after stress. These results clearly suggest that selection for stress responsiveness in rainbow trout is also associated with changes in the function of brain monoaminergic systems. The possible functional significance of these observations is discussed with respect to the physiological and behavioral profile of these strains of fish. Literature is reviewed showing that several factors affecting brain monoaminergic activity might be altered by selection for stress responsiveness, or alternatively be under direct influence of circulating glucocorticoids.

AB  - Industrial development and economic transformation have recently been attracting renewed attention. Among the significant and growing research on industrial policy, however, only a small proportion has focused on the early phases of industrial development—an essential area, as this nascent phase is quite different from the later stages of industrial development. The existing literature places importance on the accumulation of knowledge and capabilities (Cimoli et al. 2009) and creation of a learning society (Stiglitz and Greenwald 2014). Knowledge creation, capability building and learning processes are crucial factors that cannot be optimally managed via market forces. Consistent under-investment in these areas by the private sector provides a basis for arguments justifying policy intervention. However, there is no clear consensus in the existing policy-related literature regarding the type of policy interventions necessary for industrial development, the degree and duration (Rodrik 2007) or the selection of areas for intervention (Lin and Chang 2009).

AB  - In management contexts, mathematical programming is usually used to evaluate a collection of possible alternative courses of action en route to selecting one which is best. In this capacity, mathematical programming serves as a planning aid to management. Data Envelopment Analysis reverses this role and employs mathematical programming to obtain ex post facto evaluations of the relative efficiency of management accomplishments, however they may have been planned or executed. Mathematical programming is thereby extended for use as a tool for control and evaluation of past accomplishments as well as a tool to aid in planning future activities. The CCR ratio form introduced by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes, as part of their Data Envelopment Analysis approach, comprehends both technical and scale inefficiencies via the optimal value of the ratio form, as obtained directly from the data without requiring a priori specification of weights and/or explicit delineation of assumed functional forms of relations between inputs and outputs. A separation into technical and scale efficiencies is accomplished by the methods developed in this paper without altering the latter conditions for use of DEA directly on observational data. Technical inefficiencies are identified with failures to achieve best possible output levels and/or usage of excessive amounts of inputs. Methods for identifying and correcting the magnitudes of these inefficiencies, as supplied in prior work, are illustrated. In the present paper, a new separate variable is introduced which makes it possible to determine whether operations were conducted in regions of increasing, constant or decreasing returns to scale in multiple input and multiple output situations. The results are discussed and related not only to classical single output economics but also to more modern versions of economics which are identified with "contestable market theories."

AB  - Antimicrobials used in salmon aquaculture pass into the marine environment. This could have negative impacts on marine environmental biodiversity, and on terrestrial animal and human health as a result of selection for bacteria containing antimicrobial resistance genes. We therefore measured the numbers of culturable bacteria and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in marine sediments in the Calbuco Archipelago, Chile, over 12-month period at a salmon aquaculture site approximately 20 m from a salmon farm and at a control site 8 km distant without observable aquaculture activities. Three antimicrobials extensively used in Chilean salmon aquaculture (oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid, and florfenicol) were studied. Although none of these antimicrobials was detected in sediments from either site, traces of flumequine, a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial also widely used in Chile, were present in sediments from both sites during this period. There were significant increases in bacterial numbers and antimicrobial-resistant fractions to oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid, and florfenicol in sediments from the aquaculture site compared to those from the control site. Interestingly, there were similar numbers of presumably plasmid-mediated resistance genes for oxytetracycline, oxolinic acid and florfenicol in unselected marine bacteria isolated from both aquaculture and control sites. These preliminary findings in one location may suggest that the current use of large amounts of antimicrobials in Chilean aquaculture has the potential to select for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in marine sediments.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Technology adoption has played a key role in the global development and increase in agricultural productivity. However, the decision to adopt a new technology on farms is complex. While the factors that drive the adoption of new technologies have been well studied in agriculture, less attention has been paid to drivers of technology adoption in aquaculture. Aquacultural technologies have developed and advanced rapidly in recent decades, but not all technologies have been adopted readily by farmers. This review paper summarizes some of the critical factors that influence aquaculture technology adoption decisions such as: (1) method of information transfer, (2) characteristics of the technology, (3) farm characteristics, (4) economic factors, and (5) sociodemographic and institutional factors. Fish farmers have tended to adopt technologies that are perceived to be more advantageous than others in terms of productivity, cost efficiency, and ease of management. Price of aquaculture products and profit expectations from business ventures were key economic factors influencing adoption decisions. Given the wide array of species, production practices, and global nature of aquaculture, the intensity and the extent of adoption of technologies depend on the nature of the industry in which they are adopted and their economic, social, political, and regulatory environments.</jats:p>

AB  - A significant increase of concentration in the UK salmon retail subsector has heightened concerns about retail firms' ability to exercise market power in the purchase of supplies (oligopsony power). To assess the extent to which retail firms have exercised oligopsony power, we develop a dynamic error correction translog profit function to model the behaviour of retailers in the input market for smoke, fillet, and whole salmon. Initial estimates indicated violations of monotonicity and convexity conditions as implied by economic theory. In order to ameliorate the problem, a Bayesian technique was used to impose inequality restrictions to correct the anomaly. The final estimated indices of market power in the models were low and statistically significant but sufficiently closer to the perfect competition benchmark indicating that retailers as a whole behaved competitively during much of the period covered by this study.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine the choice of currency for Norwegian salmon exporters. The choice of invoicing currency will affect prices in different markets as well as risk, factors that are increasingly important as the supply chain for salmon is becoming more sophisticated and more transactions mechanisms are introduced. The results indicate that destination-specific market characteristics have impacts as to the choice of invoicing strategy. Norwegian salmon exporters primarily invoice in the export market currency (47% of the exported quantity), but also use a vehicle currency and producer pricing (19%) in a significant number of transactions. The euro is the preferred vehicle currency (18%), closely followed by the US dollar (USD) (16%). The USD is the dominating invoicing currency for exports beyond Europe.

AB  - The Chilean salmon farming industry is currently facing unprecedented economic losses related to the infectious salmon anemia (ISA) disease. Production of Atlantic salmon is being reduced from almost 400,000 tonnes in 2005 to an estimated 100,000 tonnes in 2010. The spread of and response to the disease raises a number of important issues with respect to the actions of the companies involved as well as the regulatory body. It is particularly interesting that adequate measures have not been implemented in Chile, as the species is farmed in relatively few countries and, as such, is fairly transparent. Moreover, all other major salmon-producing countries have experienced the disease, and several of the largest companies in Chile are multinationals with first-hand experience with ISA from other countries.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of tryptophan depletion in untreated depressed patients. Rapid dietary depletion of the precursor of serotonin synthesis, tryptophan, causes a transient return of depression in 67% of patients who have had a therapeutic antidepressant response. Method: Forty-three untreated depressed patients underwent tryptophan depletion in a double-blind, placebocontrolled cross-over study. After testing, they received open sequential antidepressant treatment. Results: Mood did not change when tryptophan was depleted but did change on the day after the depletion test. Relative to the control test, 37% of the patients had 10-point or greaterdecreasein Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) score, while 23% had a 10-point or greaterincreasein Ham-D score on the day after the tryptophan depletion test. Change in mood was correlated to treatment response after testing. Patients whose condition worsened proved to be highly refractory to treatment while those who showed improvment were more likely to respond. Conclusions: That tryptophan depletion did not rapidly worsen depression argues that serotonin function is not linearly related to the level of depression and if reduced serotonin function does cause depression, then it is either as predisposing factor or due to a postsynaptic deficit in the utilization of serotonin.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Here, we describe an assessment of climate‐change vulnerability for the salmon farming sector in southern Chile using a model that combines semi‐quantitative measures of Exposure (risks), Sensitivity (economic and social dependence) and Adaptation Capacity (measures that prevent and mitigate impacts). The evaluation was carried out in eight pilot communes representative of salmon production (marine grow‐out). Exposure was estimated with a semi‐quantitative risk assessment tool based on oceanographic, meteorological and hydrological information, mortality‐by‐cause databases, and through extended consultation with experts and relevant stakeholders. Threats included relevant changes in water temperature and salinity, declines in dissolved oxygen, occurrence of <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">HAB</jats:styled-content>s, and diseases that could be associated with climate change. Based on our analysis of the data, we divided the farming regions into four sub‐regions with distinctive oceanographic properties and superimposed the sea surface warming trend and a spatial pattern of mortality by respective cause. Reduction of precipitation and the increase of air and sea surface temperature are the most relevant foreseen climate change drivers, especially for regions X and <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">XI</jats:styled-content>. The resulting vulnerability matrix indicated that communes with higher production concentrations were more exposed, which in some cases coincided with higher sensitivity and lower adaptation capacity. Our models of four management scenarios allowed us to explore the changes in vulnerability associated with a southward movement of salmon production towards the Magallanes region. By identifying new protocols to increase adaptation and reduce vulnerability in a spatially explicit fashion, we provide policy recommendations aimed at increasing climate change adaptation and the long‐term sustainability of the sector.</jats:p>

AB  - Depensatory predation mortality on salmon when added to a Ricker production model can create a system with at least two stable equilibria and two domains of attraction. The behavior of such a fish system is different from a single equilibrium situation and a simple mechanism is described through which commercial exploitation changes the ability of such multiple-equilibrium fish populations to respond to perturbations in survival rates. Furthermore, it is shown that this change in size of stability regions is proportional to the exploitation rate and that classically defined maximum sustainable yield (MSY) exploitation rates are inevitably close to the rates that would cause a drastic decrease in the population. The uncertainties inherent in environmental effects on survival and in achievement of desired exploitation rates precipitate the need to back away from the usual MSY exploitation rates and set up (through enhancement) a system of stocks whereby feedback information is provided to the manager.

AB  - Benthic organic enrichment due to sedimentation of waste feed and fecal matter released from salmon and other marine finfish aquaculture facilities has traditionally been measured by observing changes in benthic macrofauna assemblages. Sediment oxygen consumption, dissolved nutrient fluxes and variables such as redox potentials (normalized to hydrogen potential, EhNHE) and dissolved 'free' sulfides (Σ S 2- , HS - , H2S) (S) are also sensitive chemical indicators of benthic enrich- ment effects. Hypoxic or anoxic sediments are formed when high rates of organic matter (OM) sedi- mentation stimulate anaerobic metabolic processes such as sulfate reduction. General changes in EhNHE, S, OM flux and indices of macrofauna diversity in sediments as a result of increased organic enrichment around salmon aquaculture sites have been described in numerous studies. Some of the results are summarized here in empirical regressions that relate changes in sediment chemical and benthic biological variables to increased OM supply. The equations are descriptive of the data for salmon aquaculture sites where the studies were performed and further investigations are required to determine if the relationships provide general quantitative expressions for changes in sediment geochemical conditions and macrofauna community structure due to benthic organic enrichment.

AB  - Coastal waters of the United States (U.S.) are subject to many of the major harmful algal bloom (HAB) poisoning syndromes and impacts. These include paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) and various other HAB phenomena such as fish kills, loss of submerged vegetation, shellfish mortalities, and widespread marine mammal mortalities. Here, the occurrences of selected HABs in a selected set of regions are described in terms of their relationship to eutrophication, illustrating a range of responses. Evidence suggestive of changes in the frequency, extent or magnitude of HABs in these areas is explored in the context of the nutrient sources underlying those blooms, both natural and anthropogenic. In some regions of the U.S., the linkages between HABs and eutrophication are clear and well documented, whereas in others, information is limited, thereby highlighting important areas for further research.

AB  - The current export boom in natural resources is considered to be the ‘new window of opportunity’ for many developing countries endowed with natural resources. Recent studies (Blomstrom and Meller 1991; de Ferranti et al. 2002; Maloney 2002; Sinnoit et al. 2010; Perez et al. 2009; Iizuka and Soete 2011) indicate that natural resource-based activities can be knowledge intensive, which contrary to earlier understandings, would lead them to productivity-led development pathways.

AB  - ▪ Abstract With continued human pressure on marine fisheries and ocean resources, aquaculture has become one of the most promising avenues for increasing marine fish production in the future. This review presents recent trends and future prospects for the aquaculture industry, with particular attention paid to ocean farming and carnivorous finfish species. The benefits of farming carnivorous fish have been challenged; extensive research on salmon has shown that farming such fish can have negative ecological, social, and health impacts on areas and parties vastly separated in space. Similar research is only beginning for the new carnivorous species farmed or ranched in marine environments, such as cod, halibut, and bluefin tuna. These fish have large market potential and are likely to play a defining role in the future direction of the aquaculture industry. We review the available literature on aquaculture development of carnivorous finfish species and assess its potential to relieve human pressure on mari...

AB  - The farming of Atlantic salmon has become an important industry in several countries, and breeding programmes have been implemented to improve genetic performance and adaptation to farm environments. Founder stocks used in the Norwegian salmon breeding programme have originated solely from Norwegian rivers and no extrinsic genes have been introduced. The majority (more than 90%) of the additive genetic variation in Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon has been found within, and not between, river strains. The Norwegian breeding programme comprises four sub-populations. In the event of reduced additive genetic variability due to random drift in the closed breeding populations, crosses between the sub-populations could be made to re-establish the variability. Selection in itself is not expected to reduce the additive genetic variability as long as inbreeding is avoided. To date, seven different traits (body weight at slaughter, age of sexual maturation, survival in challenge tests with furunculosis and ISA, flesh colour, total fat content, and amount of fat tissues) have been included in the breeding goal. The selection response obtained is about 10% per generation for each of these traits. In the future, more traits are likely to be included. The results of and prospects for selective breeding and the use of modern DNA technology to improve genetic performance in aquatic species are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Contributing to the controversies that have surrounded fish hatcheries in recent years are a number of misconceptions or myths about hatcheries and their effects on natural populations. These myths impede productive dialogue among those with differing views about hatcheries. Most of the myths include a measure of truth, which makes it difficult to recognize the elements that are not true. Consideration of these myths leads to the following conclusions: (1) Hatcheries are intrinsically neither good nor bad—their value can be determined only in the context of clearly defined goals; (2) genetic changes in cultured populations can be reduced but not eliminated entirely; (3) empirical evidence exists of many adverse effects of hatcheries, but some risks have been overstated; and (4) monitoring and evaluation programs are important but should not be used as a substitute for developing risk-averse hatchery programs in the first place. A key step in resolving some of the controversies will be moving towa...

AB  - Export orientation policy and regional development The model of export–oriented production (de–sarrollo hacia afurera), intiated in Chile from 1975 under the economic orientation of the ‘Chicago Boys’ (neoliberal economists trained at the University of Chicago), has provided the ongoing framework for the Chilean political economy during the 1990s, despite the ‘hiccup’ during the international recession of 1980–1983 (Toledo & Zapater 1991, de Mattos 1992). The transition from authoritarianism to democracy,which began in 1988, has resulted in significant changes in the political makeup of the country; however, export orientation has prevailed as a condition of General Pinochet's retreat from poner and as the chosen of the democratic Concertacion administrations.

AB  - Piscirickettsia salmonis is a fastidious intracellular pathogen responsible for high mortality rates in farmed salmonids, with serious economic consequences for the Chilean aquaculture industry. Oxytetracycline and florfenicol are the most frequently used antibiotics against P. salmonis, but routine use could contribute to drug resistance. This study identified differentiated florfenicol susceptibilities in two P. salmonis strains, LF-89 and AUSTRAL-005. The less susceptible isolate, AUSTRAL-005, also showed a high ethidium bromide efflux rate, indicating a higher activity of general efflux pump genes than LF-89. The P. salmonis genome presented resistance nodulation division (RND) family members, a family containing typical multidrug resistance-related efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, efflux pump acrAB genes were overexpressed in AUSTRAL-005 following exposure to the tolerated maximal concentration of florfenicol, in contrast to LF-89. These results indicate that tolerated maximum concentrations of florfenicol can modulate RND gene expression and increase efflux pump activity. We propose that the acrAB efflux pump is essential for P. salmonis survival at critical florfenicol concentrations and for the generation of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.

AB  - For some salmon populations, the individual and population effects of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) transmission from sea cage salmon farms is probably mediated by predation, which is a primary natural source of mortality of juvenile salmon. We examined how sea lice infestation affects predation risk and mortality of juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon, and developed a mathematical model to assess the implications for population dynamics and conservation. A risk-taking experiment indicated that infected juvenile pink salmon accept a higher predation risk in order to obtain foraging opportunities. In a schooling experiment with juvenile chum salmon, infected individuals had increased nearest-neighbor distances and occupied peripheral positions in the school. Prey selection experiments with cutthroat trout (O. clarkii) predators indicated that infection reduces the ability of juvenile pink salmon to evade a predatory strike. Group predation experiments with coho salmon (O. kisutch) feeding on juvenile pink or chum salmon indicated that predators selectively consume infected prey. The experimental results indicate that lice may increase the rate of prey capture but not the handling time of a predator. Based on this result, we developed a mathematical model of sea lice and salmon population dynamics in which parasitism affects the attack rate in a type II functional response. Analysis of the model indicates that: (1) the estimated mortality of wild juvenile salmon due to sea lice infestation is probably higher than previously thought; (2) predation can cause a simultaneous decline in sea louse abundance on wild fish and salmon productivity that could mislead managers and regulators; and (3) compensatory mortality occurs in the saturation region of the type II functional response where prey are abundant because predators increase mortality of parasites but not overall predation rates. These findings indicate that predation is an important component of salmon-louse dynamics and has implications for estimating mortality, reducing infection, and developing conservation policy.

AB  - The acute stress of handling followed by confinement for a period of 1 or 24 hr caused a typical stress response in rainbow trout (elevation of plasma ACTH and cortisol) and a significant reduction in the concentration of circulating growth hormone. The chronic stress of low oxygen levels in both crowded and uncrowded tanks of fish caused a significant elevation of circulating GH levels, an effect which was abolished by the provision of additional aeration to the rearing tanks. This chronic elevation of GH levels was closely correlated with an elevation of plasma cortisol in the same fish. These findings are discussed in relation to stress-induced growth suppression and to the links between the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis and somatotrope activity.

AB  - The objective was to present 2 methods for the derivation of nonmarket values for functional traits in dairy cattle using deterministic simulation and selection index theory. A nonmarket value can be a value representing animal welfare and societal influences for animal production, which can be added to market economic values in the breeding goal to define sustainable breeding goals. The first method was restricted indices. A consequence of adding a nonmarket value to a market economic value for a given functional trait is less selection emphasis on milk yield. In the second method, the loss in selection response in milk resulting from greater emphasis on functional traits was quantified. The 2 methods were demonstrated using a breeding goal for dairy cattle with 4 traits (milk yield, mastitis resistance, conception rate, and stillbirth). Nonmarket values derived separately using restricted indices were 0.4 and 2.6 times the value of market economic values for mastitis resistance and conception rate, respectively. Nonmarket values for mastitis resistance and conception rate were both lower when derived simultaneously than when derived separately. This was due to the positive genetic correlation between mastitis resistance and conception rate, and because both traits are negatively correlated with milk yield. Using the second method and accepting a 5% loss in selection response for milk yield, nonmarket values for mastitis, conception rate, and stillbirth were 0.3, 1.4, and 2.9 times the market economic values. It was concluded that the 2 methods could be used to derive nonmarket values for functional traits in dairy cattle.

AB  - Non-governmental organizations play an increasingly important role in the formation and implementation of environmental policies and institutions. The growing involvement of non-state actors in environmental governance is generally welcomed for two reasons: civil society presumably helps governments reach more effective and democratic agreements by providing information and legitimacy. Yet, there are reasons to doubt civil society’s capacity to fulfill these two functions. Many non-governmental organizations themselves lack democratic legitimacy; and weak international agreements are often the result not of lack of information, but of lack of political will. While non-state actors clearly have an important role to play in global environmental governance, this article calls for more research to identify when and how non-state actors indeed contribute to more effective and democratically more legitimate governance.

AB  - Persistence and dispersal of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are important factors for assessing ARG risk in aquaculture environments. Here, we quantitatively detected ARGs for sulphonamides (sul1 and sul2) and trimethoprim (dfrA1) and an integrase gene for a class 1 integron (intI1) at aquaculture facilities in the northern Baltic Sea, Finland. The ARGs persisted in sediments below fish farms at very low antibiotic concentrations during the 6-year observation period from 2006 to 2012. Although the ARGs persisted in the farm sediments, they were less prevalent in the surrounding sediments. The copy numbers between the sul1 and intI1 genes were significantly correlated suggesting that class 1 integrons may play a role in the prevalence of sul1 in the farm sediments through horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, the presence of ARGs may limit the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating fish illnesses, thereby causing a potential risk to the aquaculture industry. However, the restricted presence of ARGs at the farms is unlikely to cause serious effects in the northern Baltic Sea sediment environments around the farms.

AB  - It is now well recognized that there are more harmful algal blooms (HABs), more often, in new and different places, often lasting longer, and with a range of toxicities, and that many of these blooms are related to nutrient pollution. Nutrient loads are increasing globally, but they are changing regionally in proportion and in the dominant form of nutrient. The fact that nutrient loads have generally increased is, in itself, insufficient for the promotion of HABs. The success of HABs lies at the intersection of the physiological adaptations of the harmful algal species, environmental conditions, and interactions with co-occurring organisms that alter abiotic conditions and/or aggregate or disperse cells, in turn promoting or inhibiting their growth. It is a change in the supply of the right nutrients at the right time that helps to create conditions conducive to specific HABs. Many dinoflagellate and cyanobacterial HABs appear to have adaptations that allow them to exploit environments—and potentially even become more toxic—where nutrients are not in balanced (Redfield) proportions. HABs are also changing in complex ways due to changes in climate and many other changes that affect the timing, amount, or proportions of nutrients. There is much work to be done to understand the physiological ecology of HABs and other co-occurring species. Climate change and altered CO2 levels, and their implications for altered productivity of the global ocean, should motivate both new models and new experimental investigations that support them. Based on current knowledge, the management implications are clear: the most effective actions to reduce HABs and their impacts will be continued efforts to reduce nutrients entering our waters.

AB  - Marine fisheries target and catch fish both for direct human consumption (DHC) as well as for fishmeal and fish oil, and other products. We derived the fractions used for each for 1950–2010 by fishing country, and thus provide a factual foundation for discussions of the optimal use of fisheries resources. From 1950 to 2010, 27% (~20 million tonnes annually) of globally reconstructed marine fisheries landings were destined for uses other than DHC. Importantly, 90% of fish destined for uses other than DHC are food-grade or prime food-grade fish, while fish without a ready market for DHC make up a much smaller proportion. These findings have implications for how we are using fish to feed ourselves or, more appropriately, how we are not using fish to feed ourselves.

AB  - The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.

AB  - Conservation hatcheries are unproven in restoring threatened and endangered populations of salmon to sustainable levels, and may cause more harm than good. Nonetheless, a recent court decision found that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) must include hatchery salmon in Endangered Species Act listings, where NMFS has included those fish as components of the core "evolutionarily significant units (ESUs)." This undercuts efforts for restoration of wild salmon. The
 authors
 of this Policy Forum, therefore, urge that NMFS use a more legally defensible definition of an ESU; artificially propagated individuals should not be included in ESUs, even if they are indistinguishable at indicator genetic loci. Hatcheries generally reduce current fitness and inhibit future adaptation of natural populations. Hence, the legal definition of an ESU must be unambiguous and must exclude hatchery fish.

AB  - Abstract Over the course of the 20th century, fossil fuels became the dominant energy input to most of the world's fisheries. Although various analyses have quantified fuel inputs to individual fisheries, to date, no attempt has been made to quantify the global scale and to map the distribution of fuel consumed by fisheries. By integrating data representing more than 250 fisheries from around the world with spatially resolved catch statistics for 2000, we calculate that globally, fisheries burned almost 50 billion L of fuel in the process of landing just over 80 million t of marine fish and invertebrates for an average rate of 620 L t−1. Consequently, fisheries account for about 1.2% of global oil consumption, an amount equivalent to that burned by the Netherlands, the 18th-ranked oil consuming country globally, and directly emit more than 130 million t of CO2 into the atmosphere. From an efficiency perspective, the energy content of the fuel burned by global fisheries is 12.5 times greater than the edibl...

AB  - Este texto analiza el proceso regulatorio y certificatorio de la salmonicultura chilena a partir de los discursos de sus actores. A traves del caso se muestra primero como las nuevas estructuras de gobernanza en el contexto neoliberal son resultado de procesos de negociacion entre diversos actores. Segundo se argumenta que estas, logran articular racionalidades e intereses ambientales de una variedad de actores de la industria y la sociedad civil, pero al costo de menoscabar la cuestion socio-laboral y suprimir la pregunta de quien tiene acceso al uso de la naturaleza. Ello consolida privatizacion de los comunes del “maritorio” y contribuye a la exclusion de un conjunto de actores organizados.

AB  - Demand for animal protein for human consumption is rising globally at an unprecedented rate. Modern animal production practices are associated with regular use of antimicrobials, potentially increasing selection pressure on bacteria to become resistant. Despite the significant potential consequences for antimicrobial resistance, there has been no quantitative measurement of global antimicrobial consumption by livestock. We address this gap by using Bayesian statistical models combining maps of livestock densities, economic projections of demand for meat products, and current estimates of antimicrobial consumption in high-income countries to map antimicrobial use in food animals for 2010 and 2030. We estimate that the global average annual consumption of antimicrobials per kilogram of animal produced was 45 mg⋅kg(-1), 148 mg⋅kg(-1), and 172 mg⋅kg(-1) for cattle, chicken, and pigs, respectively. Starting from this baseline, we estimate that between 2010 and 2030, the global consumption of antimicrobials will increase by 67%, from 63,151 ± 1,560 tons to 105,596 ± 3,605 tons. Up to a third of the increase in consumption in livestock between 2010 and 2030 is imputable to shifting production practices in middle-income countries where extensive farming systems will be replaced by large-scale intensive farming operations that routinely use antimicrobials in subtherapeutic doses. For Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the increase in antimicrobial consumption will be 99%, up to seven times the projected population growth in this group of countries. Better understanding of the consequences of the uninhibited growth in veterinary antimicrobial consumption is needed to assess its potential effects on animal and human health.

AB  - The annual global production of farmed salmon has increased by a factor of 40 during the past two decades. Salmon from farms in northern Europe, North America, and Chile are now available widely year-round at relatively low prices. Salmon farms have been criticized for their ecological effects, but the potential human health risks of farmed salmon consumption have not been examined rigorously. Having analyzed over 2 metric tons of farmed and wild salmon from around the world for organochlorine contaminants, we show that concentrations of these contaminants are significantly higher in farmed salmon than in wild. European-raised salmon have significantly greater contaminant loads than those raised in North and South America, indicating the need for further investigation into the sources of contamination. Risk analysis indicates that consumption of farmed Atlantic salmon may pose health risks that detract from the beneficial effects of fish consumption.

AB  - Water is one of the most important bacterial habitats on Earth. As such, water represents also a major way of dissemination of bacteria between different environmental compartments. Human activities led to the creation of the so-called urban water cycle, comprising different sectors (waste, surface, drinking water), among which bacteria can hypothetically be exchanged. Therefore, bacteria can be mobilized between unclean water habitats (e.g. wastewater) and clean or pristine water environments (e.g. disinfected and spring drinking water) and eventually reach humans. In addition, bacteria can also transfer mobile genetic elements between different water types, other environments (e.g. soil) and humans. These processes may involve antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes. In this review, the hypothesis that some bacteria may share different water compartments and be also hosted by humans is discussed based on the comparison of the bacterial diversity in different types of water and with the human-associated microbiome. The role of such bacteria as potential disseminators of antibiotic resistance and the inference that currently only a small fraction of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistome may be known is discussed.

AB  - In Public Policy : Politics, Analysis, and Alternatives, students come to understand how and why policy analysis is used to assess policy alternatives. To encourage critical and creative thinking on issues ranging from the federal deficit to health care reform to climate change, authors Michael Kraft and Scott Furlong introduce and fully integrate an evaluative approach to policy. The Sixth Edition of Public Policy offers a fully revised, concise review of institutions, policy actors, and major theoretical models as well as a discussion of the nature of policy analysis and its practice. Both the exposition and data have been updated to reflect major policy controversies and developments through the end of 2016, including new priorities of the Donald Trump administration.

AB  - 1. Escape of cultured organisms into natural ecosystems may threaten wild populations both ecologically and genetically. In the aquaculture industry, farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) often escape and enter the spawning grounds of wild salmon. We report experiments to assess the competitive and reproductive abilities of fifth-generation farmed salmon and their potential impacts upon wild salmon. 2. The farmed and wild females had similar levels of competitive behaviour; however, they differed in reproductive behaviour and success. Farmed females displayed less breeding behaviour, constructed fewer nests, retained a greater weight of eggs unspawned, were less efficient at nest covering, incurred more nest destruction, and suffered greater egg mortality than wild females. As a result, farmed females had less than one-third of the reproductive success of wild females. 3. The farmed males were even less successful than the farmed females in competition with the wild fish. They were less aggressive, courted less, partook in fewer spawnings, and achieved only an estimated one to three percentage of the reproductive success of the wild males. 4. The farmed males exhibited inappropriate mating behaviour, that led to poor fertilization success, even in the absence of competition with wild males. 5. Adult farmed fish are thus likely to be relatively unsuccessful in natural environments due to a competitive and reproductive inferiority apparently resulting from domestication.

AB  - Resistance to tetracycline, macrolides and streptomycin was measured for a period of 8 months in soil bacteria obtained from farmland treated with pig manure slurry. This was done by spread plating bacteria on selective media (Luria Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with antibiotics). To account for seasonal variations in numbers of soil bacteria, ratios of resistant bacteria divided by total count on nonselective plates were calculated. Soil samples were collected from four different farms and from a control soil on a fifth farm. The control soil was not amended with animal manure. The occurrence of tetracycline-resistant bacteria was elevated after spread of pig manure slurry but declined throughout the sampling period to a level corresponding to the control soil. Higher load of pig manure slurry yielded higher occurrence of tetracycline resistance after spreading; however, the tetracycline resistance declined to normal occurrence defined by the tetracycline resistance occurrence in the control soil. Concentrations of tetracycline in soil and in pig manure slurry were measured using HPLC. No tetracycline exceeding the detection limit was found in soil samples. Manure slurry concentrations of tetracycline for three of the farms were 42, 81 and 698 microg/l, respectively. For streptomycin and macrolides, only minor variations in resistance levels were detected. Results obtained in this study thus indicate that tetracycline resistance levels in soil are temporarily influenced by the addition of pig manure slurry. The results indicate also that increased amount of pig manure slurry amendment may result in increased levels of tetracycline resistance in the soil.

The predation of farmed salmon by South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) in southern Chile. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 475-482.The South American sea lion Otaria flavescens is abundant off southern Chile. Because Chilean salmon farming has experienced an explosive growth in the past two decades, interactions between O. flavescens and this industry have increased. Fieldwork, including in situ behavioural observations, was carried out at three salmon farms off southern Chile from May to July 2008. The aim was to analyse possible patterns in the interactions and to evaluate whether they were influenced by the endogenous circa-rhythms of the species, prey size, tidal flux, and the use of an acoustic harassment device (AHD). The results showed that the attacks by O. flavescens followed seasonal patterns, with salmon predated more in autumn and winter, and daily patterns, with more interactions at night. In addition, attacks were more frequent on larger salmon, suggesting the existence of a prey-size preference. More sea lions were sighted at the ebb and flow tide peaks, when currents are stronger, suggesting that currents linked to tidal flux might facilitate the access of the sea lions to the farmed salmon. Although the use of AHDs appeared positive at one site, there is a strong suspicion that their efficacy may be site-specific.

AB  - Human beings may affect the welfare of fish through fisheries, aquaculture and a number of other activities. There is no agreement on just how to we igh the concern for welfare of fish against the hum an interests involved, but ethical frameworks exist th at suggest how this might be approached. Different definitions of animal welfare focus on an animal's condition, on its subjective experience o f that condition and/or on whether it can lead a natu ral life. These provide different, legitimate, pers pectives, but the approach taken in this paper is to focus on welfare as the absence of suffering. An unresolved and controversial issue in discussion s about animal welfare is whether non-human animals exposed to adverse experiences such as physical injury or confinement experience what humans would call suffering. The neocortex, which in huma ns is an important part of the neural mechanism tha t generates the subjective experience of suffering, i s lacking in fish and non-mammalian animals, and it has been argued that its absence in fish indicates that fish cannot suffer. However, a strong alternative view is that complex animals with sophisticated behaviour, such as fish, probably have the capacity for suffer ing, though this may be different in degree and kind fro m the human experience of this state. Recent empirical studies support this view and show that painful stimuli are, at least, strongly avers ive to fish. Consequently, injury or experience of othe r harmful conditions is a cause for concern in term s of welfare of individual fish. There is also growing e vidence that fish can experience fear-like states a nd that they avoid situations in which they have experience d adverse conditions.

AB  - Recently three biogeographical units were identified along the Chilean coast (the Magellanic Province, an Intermediate Area, and the Peruvian Province), however few studies have focused on the factors and dynamic processes that formed these spatial units (e.g. Rapoport's rule and its causal mechanisms). In this study we used benthic polychaetes of the Chilean coast to evaluate patterns of latitudinal distribution and species richness, and the existence of the three main biogeographical provinces described for the Chilean coast. Additionally, we evaluated the latitudinal Rapoport effects and geometric constraint as a null hypothesis explaining the species richness distribution. We found that benthic polychaete diversity increased towards southern latitudes. The cluster and ordination (non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling, nMDS) analyses of the distribution data, presented only two statistically significant (bootstrapping techniques) biogeographic provinces along the Chilean coast, with a break occurring between 41° and 42°S. While, our results did not support a latitudinal Rapoport effect, they did support the view that latitudinal Rapoport effects are a local phenomenon, occurring only for the Northeastern Pacific marine taxa. The relationship between latitudinal range extent and mean latitude indicated the existence of two hard boundaries at either extreme of the Chilean coast, limiting the geographical ranges of the species. However, geometric constraints tested using a Monte Carlo simulation approach showed a weak level of mid-domain effect on species richness. Finally, we propose that geometric constraint together with the geomorphology and historical characteristics of the Chilean coast explain the biogeographical patterns of benthic polychaete taxa in Chile.

Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer), infestation in sympatric populations of Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), and sea trout, Salmo trutta (L.), in areas near and distant from salmon farms. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 59: 131–139. The abundance of salmon lice was examined in two stocks of sympatric anadromous Arctic char and sea trout in sub-Arctic regions in northern Norway in June, July, and August 1992 and 1993. One stock feeds in a coastal area exposed to moderate salmon farming activity (exposed area), while the other feed in a region without salmon farms (unexposed area). The salmon lice infestation on both species differed significantly between the exposed and unexposed area as well as between years and also between weeks within the same year. We did not detect, however, any clear significant differences in salmon lice abundance between sympatric populations of Arctic char and sea trout, or between different size groups of the species. The 1992 and 1993 infestation pattern in the exposed area showed an epidemic tendency in both Arctic char and sea trout, characterised by a sudden increase in both prevalence and abundance of lice larvae in July 1992 (23.625.7 lice/fish) and August 1993 (19.920.8 lice/fish). We therefore suggest that salmon lice epidemics, previously only observed on sea trout, may also occur in populations of Arctic char, and that fish farming contributes to the elevated lice level in wild fish. The fish in the unexposed area were also infested, although at significantly lower levels than fish from the exposed area. The infestation peaked in August 1992 at 13.018.1 lice/fish and August 1993 at 3.94.5 lice/fish, suggested that lice originating on ascending wild Atlantic salmon, or lice larvae drifting from farming areas, may infest Arctic char and sea trout also in unexposed localities in Subarctic areas. 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea

AB  - In this master thesis the structural modeling of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) net panel has been done using finite element software (ABAQUS). The model was built corresponding to the net panel experiment performed by SINTEF Fisheries and Aquaculture. The construction of the model was done by using Timoshenko beam element (B31) and performing static analysis. The current forces from the experiment (2.63N, 6.9N, 11.9N, 17.99N and 25.6N) were simulated using line loads completely distributed over the net panel model. In addition, big challenges were found when constructed the vertical bar due to the complex geometry of PET net, for that reason the model was simplified in the vertical bar. The displacements of the model were bigger with increasing the applied load, same reaction as the experiments. While comparing the results with the experiment it was found that the ABAQUS model had a good matching at bigger loads. However it is was concluded that the model can structurally simulate in a good grade the behavior of the net panel from the experiment.

AB  - Abstract The azamethiphos formulation Salmosan ® has been used to control sea lice on Atlantic salmon. To determine the effect of this pesticide on spawning in the American lobster, pre-ovigerous females acclimated to 13 °C were given biweekly 1-h exposures to Salmosan ® at concentrations of 1.25–10 μg/L azamethiphos. In March and April, four exposures to 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 μg/L had no significant effect on survival or spawning incidence, while three or four exposures to 10 μg/L caused high mortality (43–100%). Spawning incidence in the surviving lobsters in the 10 μg/L groups was significantly reduced in the group given four treatments, but not in the group given three treatments. In December and January, four exposures to 10 μg/L azamethiphos had no significant effect on either survival or spawning incidence. The results demonstrate that repeated 1-h biweekly exposures to azamethiphos can have a negative effect on survival and spawning in female American lobsters. The response to this pesticide appears to be influenced by time of year, as well as concentration and number of exposures.

AB  - Agglomeration externalities can have positive effects on both the production possibility frontier and technical inefficiency of firms. Increased levels of localized knowledge spillovers and substitution of internal inputs with external inputs may lead to fewer errors in decision-making and execution of production tasks, thus causing firms to become technically more efficient relative to the production frontier. When we estimate a stochastic frontier production model on a large panel of salmon aquaculture farms, we find econometric support for positive agglomeration externalities on both the production frontier and technical inefficiency.

AB  - This article builds on the literature investigating productivity and efficiency in the Norwegian salmon farming industry. The objective of this article is to investigate the determinants of inefficiency. We use a stochastic frontier approach that allows the estimation of a production function and an inefficiency function. The sources of inefficiency can be separated into temporary shocks and factors that lead to permanent efficiency differences. The results indicate an improvement in technical efficiency over time. This improvement can partly be explained by a restructuring of the industry, with firms becoming bigger and more specialized, as well as by improvements in government regulations. The inefficiency that is still present is mainly the result of temporary shocks. Disease outbreaks seem to be the most important of these temporary shocks, as disease problems lead to early harvesting or destruction of the fish and thereby, obviously, increase inefficiency.

AB  - ABSTRACTWe analyzed whether a competitive market can behave non-competitively when it is temporarily outside of its long-run equilibrium trajectory. Our data sample allowed us to examine the functioning of the Atlantic salmon market in the United States when experiencing a sharp reduction in imports because of a sanitary outbreak that affected its Chilean suppliers. We estimated the Steen and Salvanes extension of the Bresnahan–Lau model. Our results show that in the long run, the market behaves competitively. However, there is evidence of a disequilibrium effect on price in the recovery phase of the crisis. The decrease in the price observed during the recovery was caused by supply overshooting, whereas the increase in salmon’s market price observed right after the disease outbreak cannot be attributed to reduced Chilean supply.

AB  - The production of farmed salmonids in Chile reached 550 000 t in 2004. The industry is considered to be consolidated, but with potential for further expansion to the south into pristine coastal areas. The environmental impacts of the salmonid farming industry in Chile were reviewed in 1996, and evidence at that time did not suggest significant adverse effects. However, after almost ten years of sustained growth, current evidence indicates that significant loss of benthic biodiversity and localized changes in the physico-chemical properties of sediments have occurred in areas with salmonid farms. Furthermore, the presence of these farms significantly increases in pulses the density of dinoflagellates. Data suggest that escaped farmed fish may have an impact on native species, although their survival in the wild appears low. The abundance of omnivorous diving and carrion-feeding marine birds increased from twofold to fivefold in areas with salmon farms compared with control areas without them. It is urgent that an ecosystem approach be implemented to assess all impacts of salmonid farming on coastal ecosystems in southern Chile.

AB  - Mating structure can influence the variance in individual reproductive suc- cess, which in turn has important implications for a population's effective size. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) males are characterized by alternative reproductive strategies, ma- turing as small parr in fresh water and/or as considerably larger anadromous males following a migration to sea. The potential for significant variation in individual reproductive success in both sexes is high. We established two experimental crosses each involving four anad- romous females, four anadromous males, and 20 mature male parr in a seminatural spawning environment. We used hyper-variable microsatellite loci to identify the parents of 755 embryos and to quantify the variance in individual fertilization success. Anadromous males generally dominated fertilization success, with a mean individual fertilization success of 15.7% and 19.3% in replicates A and B, respectively, as compared with 1.9% and 1.2% for the mature male parr. There was no relationship between individual mature male parr size and individual fertilization success in any individual nest, nor was there any relationship between anadromous male size and individual fertilization success in either replicate. There was some evidence of size being an important determinant of both the frequency of spawning and the overall individual parr fertilization success among those parr identified as having spawned, although these relationships were not always significant. Both anadromous males and females were identified as having spawned with multiple partners, although the fre- quency of multiple anadromous males spawning simultaneously with a female was low. Fertilization of eggs by parr can significantly increase the effective number of males on a nest-by-nest basis; however, the variance in individual anadromous male fertilization suc- cess appears to have the greatest overall influence on effective population size.

AB  - Among juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar either being fed ad libitum throughout a 3 month experiment or deprived of food in the middle month, food deprivation led to a decrease in SMR, which increased again once food was supplied ad libitum again. While the rank order of SMR among fish fed throughout remained relatively stable, that within the deprived group was inconsistent, suggesting that individual fish vary in their ability to reduce metabolic costs when food availability is low.

AB  - Circulation of mobile genetic elements linked to drug resistance spread was studied in Vibrio strains isolated from surface urban water (river and sea) and shellfish samples in 2002-2003 in Maputo, Mozambique. Class 1 integrons and integrating conjugative elements (ICE) were investigated by PCR and mating experiments in strains of major health interest: 10 Vibrio cholerae, six Vibrio parahaemolyticus, two Vibrio alginolyticus and one Vibrio fluvialis. Resistance to at least two antibiotics (predominantly beta-lactams) was detected in all the strains, with additional resistances to sulfamethoxazole, spectinomycin, streptomycin and/or trimethoprim. Class 1 integrons contributed partially to the expression of drug resistance and were found in five isolates: four V. cholerae (blaP1 cassette, one strain also contained the dfrA15 cassette) and one V. alginolyticus (aadA2 cassette). ICEs, apparently devoid of resistance genes, were found in eight V. cholerae, three V. parahaemolyticus and one V. fluvialis isolates. A wide variability was observed by molecular characterization of ICEs. Five ICEs were included in the SXT/R391 family and seven ICEs were not classified. Our results indicate that the SXT/R391 family and related ICEs comprise a large class of polymorphic genetic elements widely circulating in environmental Vibrio strains in Africa, beside those evidently linked to drug resistance in clinical isolates.

AB  - This paper gives a summary of previously published results of studies on the dispersal of oxytetracycline from the vicinity of a typical salmon farm. These studies showed the environmental impact of occasional treatments to be negligible. Concentrations of oxytetracycline (OTC) were measured in the benthic sediments and in mussel Mytilus edulis sampled in the vicinity of an inshore salmon farm on the west coast of Ireland. Concentrations between 1.0 μg/g and 14.7 μg/g were observed in sediments within 120 m from the farm. Concentrations declined exponentially with time, reaching low levels after 32 days and reduced to traces at 66 days. The highest concentrations were observed in the top 2 cm of sediment, falling to trace levels at a depth of 10 cm. The half-life of OTC persistence in mussels was found to be approximately 2 days. Residues in unpolluted sediment beneath the cages were never present in high concentrations and were flushed out rapidly. In the presence of excessive quantities of unconsumed food pellets on the seabed and in anoxic sediment, the persistence of OTC was significantly prolonged. Monitoring the quality of the sediment could therefore provide adequate indication of any risk of accumulation of antibiotic, without the need for elaborate chemical analyses. Residues in sediment, invertebrates and salmon could account for not more than 1.3% of total input of OTC. It was concluded that the antibiotic was very rapidly dispersed in the environment and its use in salmon therapy posed no material risk to human or environmental health.

AB  - In this study, we measure the value of sanitary restrictions in terms of forgone profits. For this, we model the short-run trade-off between biosecurity and profits in the aquaculture industry. Incorporating the concept of “sanitary desirable volume (SDV)” for the salmon industry, we optimize a multiobjective model using base information from the Los Lagos region in Chile and identify a Pareto frontier. Within this setting, we analyze the shadow price of one objective in terms of the other, the effect of changes in the administrative regulations that limit fish density in the farms and the effect of prices on the Pareto frontier. We find that the effect of sanitary restrictions in terms of forgone profits is quantitatively important and that this effect is dependent on both the level of sanitary restrictions and the relative product prices. This has important implications for the design of sanitary restrictions in aquaculture. The level of the SDV should be determined carefully to avoid costly excess regulation. Moreover, market conditions can also affect the optimal level of regulation.

AB  - Abstract Since the beginnings of the aquaculture industry in Norway, the salmon farming industry has grown from a pioneering niche to a massive industrial adventure. Since 1992, Norwegian salmon production has increased to ten times its 1992 level. By 2015, the Norwegian production constituted 53% of the world's production of Atlantic salmon. Therefore, it could be said that salmon farming is the most important industry in rural Norway today, with a yearly landing value of about 6.1 billion EUR. As the production has grown, along with the income, numerous environmental issues have arisen. The present paper gives an overview of these environmental problems and discusses potential solutions, as well as the need for a better and more holistic regulation of the industry. The experience from Norwegian salmon farming with respect to environmental issues and regulation may give important insights to both other salmon producing countries as well as producers of other fish species.

AB  - Although seafood is the most highly traded food internationally, it is an often overlooked component of global food security. It provides essential local food, livelihoods, and export earnings. Although global capture fisheries production is unlikely to increase, aquaculture is growing considerably. Sustaining seafood's contributions to food security hinges on the ability of institutions, particularly in developing countries, to protect and improve ecosystem health in the face of increasing pressures from international trade.

AB  - Abstract: Any release of transgenic organisms into nature is a concern because ecological relationships between genetically engineered organisms and other organisms (including their wild‐type conspecifics) are unknown. To address this concern, we developed a method to evaluate risk in which we input estimates of fitness parameters from a founder population into a recurrence model to predict changes in transgene frequency after a simulated transgenic release. With this method, we grouped various aspects of an organism’s life cycle into six net fitness components: juvenile viability, adult viability, age at sexual maturity, female fecundity, male fertility, and mating advantage. We estimated these components for wild‐type and transgenic individuals using the fish, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). We generalized our model’s predictions using various combinations of fitness component values in addition to our experimentally derived estimates. Our model predicted that, for a wide range of parameter values, t...

AB  - Historically the Chilean economy has been based in exports accounting for 35% of the gross domestic product and mining is the main export income in the country. However, since 1980s as a part of a promotion the Chilean economy has diversified in part away from its dangerous over-reliance on copper exports. The growth of earnings in the fruit, wine, wood and forestry, fisheries and aquaculture sectors in particular, has been rapid since the early 1980s as Chile has exploited its comparative advantage in environmental endowment and low labour costs on the global market (Barton, 1997; Barton & Murray, 2009). The salmonid cultivation is restricted to regions with particular water temperature ranges in both fresh and seawater environments, sheltered waters and critically excellent water quality. Thus, salmonid aquaculture has become an important activity and the main development gear in the southern regions of Chile. The Chilean salmon industry has shown a fast development over the last 20 years and, therefore; today, Chile is the largest producer of farmed rainbow trout and Coho salmon, and the second worldwide of Atlantic salmon. This situation is the result from the application of innovation and development of value added products, which produced an average annual growth rate of 22% from 1990 to 2007 and an increase of exports from USD 159 million in 1991 to USD 2,242 million in 2007 (SalmonChile, 2007a). In 2006, salmon exports represented 12.94% of the non-mining-related national exports and 38.75% of the Chilean food exports that decreased due to a sanitary crisis down to 9.94% and 31.08% in 2010, respectively (Banco Central de Chile, 2010). The latter indicated that the salmon industry has become an important factor in economic diversification and one fundamental base in the strategy towards positioning Chile in the top rank of world food producers (SalmonChile, 2007b). The growth of aquaculture also impact positively other important sectors of the national economy, such as transport, processing, feed and engineer suppliers, laboratories, veterinary services and many others.

AB  - Primal panel data models of production risk are estimated, using more flexible specifications than has previously been the practice. Production risk has important implications for the analysis of technology adoption and technical efficiency, since risk averse producers will take into account both the mean and variance of output when ranking alternative technologies. Hence, one should estimate technical change separately for the deterministic part and the risk part of thetechnology.

AB  - While organic matter in sediments is an important source of food for benthic fauna, an overabundance can cause reductions in species richness, abundance, and biomass due to oxygen depletion and buildup of toxic by-products (ammonia and sulphide) associated with the breakdown of these materials. Moreover, increasing organic content of sediment is often accompanied by other chemical stressors co-varying with sediment particle size. In the present study, synoptic data on the structure of macroinfaunal communities and total organic carbon (TOC) content of sediment were obtained from 951 stations representing 7 coastal regions of the world: the northern Black Sea (Crimean and Caucasian coasts); eastern Mediterranean Sea (Greece); North Sea (Ekofisk oil field); Firth of Clyde and Liverpool Bay, UK; Seto Inland Sea, Japan; Boston Harbor and Massachusetts Bay, USA and estuaries of the southeastern USA. Macroinfaunal and TOC data were examined to look for patterns of association consistent with conceptual model predictions and to identify TOC critical points corresponding to major shifts in the benthic data. Species richness, Hurlbert's E (Sn), was selected as the primary response parameter. Results suggested that risks of reduced species richness from organic loading and other associated stressors in sediments should be relatively low at TOC concentrations less than about 10 mg g -1 , high at concentrations greater than about 35 mg g -1 , and intermediate at concentrations in between. Predictive ability across these ranges was high based on results of re-sampling simulation. While not a measure of causality, it is anticipated that these TOC critical points may be used as a general screening-level indicator for evaluating the likelihood of reduced sediment quality and associated bioeffects over broad coastal areas receiving organic wastes and other pollutants from human activities.

AB  - Public awareness of possible environmental impacts of seafood consumption is growing. The seafood industry and environmental pressure groups have begun to certify fish and other aquatic products produced to sustainable standards. Representations of sustainability advanced by both groups in relation to tilapia converge around limited definitions related primarily to technical parameters. Such an approach does not adequately represent the complexity of sustainable aquaculture and may be counterproductive. This is illustrated by a comparing assumptions embedded in the text of the World Wide Fund for Nature's “tilapia aquaculture dialogue” with empirical findings from a study assessing the sustainability of tilapia farming systems in Central Thailand. Building on these findings, representations of sustainable tilapia aquaculture produced by the “tilapia aquaculture dialogue” are criticized, and it is argued that new approaches are required if sustainable aquaculture is to be meaningfully understood and implem...

AB  - Incorporation of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) into freshwater food webs of southeastern Alaska was studied by measuring the natural abundance of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes in biota from artificial and natural streams. Biofilm, aquatic macroinvertebrates (detritivores, shredders, and predators), and fish (coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, and cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki) were sampled from streams in which Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses had been artificially placed or were present naturally. In the presence of carcasses, all trophic levels incorporated marine-derived nitrogen (range, 22-73% of total N) and carbon (range, 7-52% of total C). In general, chironomid midges assimilated more marine-derived nitrogen and carbon than did other consumers. The assimilation of MDN by aquatic organisms and subsequent isotopic enrichment (5-6‰ for 15 N, 3-4‰ for 13 C) were similar in experimentally and naturally carcass-enriched streams. For specific taxa, however, percent assimilation for marine nitrogen and carbon were often dissimilar, possibly because of fractionation or transfer inefficiencies. These results suggest that pathways of MDN incorporation into stream food webs include both consumption of salmon material by macroinvertebrates and fish and uptake of mineralized MDN by biofilm. Incorporation of MDN into multiple trophic levels demonstrates the ecological significance of annual returns of anadromous fishes for sustaining the productivity of freshwater food webs. Resume : La mesure de l'abondance naturelle des isotopes stables d'azote et de carbone chez les organismes vivants de cours d'eau naturels et artificiels a permis d'etudier l'incorporation des nutriments d'origine marine (MDN) dans les reseaux alimentaires d'eau douce dans le sud-est de l'Alaska. Nous avons preleve des echantillons de biofilm, de macroinvertebres aquatiques (detrivivores, dechiqueteurs et predateurs) et de poissons (saumons coho, Oncorhynchus kisutch, et truites fardees, Oncorhynchus clarki) dans des cours d'eau ou des carcasses de saumons du Pacifique (Oncorhynchus spp.) se retrouvaient naturellement ou avaient ete ajoutees experimentalement. En presence des carcas- ses, les organismes de tous les niveaux trophiques incorporent de l'azote (etendue, 22-73 % de N total) et du carbone (etendue, 7-52 % de C total) d'origine marine. En general, les chironomides assimilent plus d'azote et de carbone d'origine marine que ne le font les autres invertebres. L'assimilation de MDN par les organismes aquatiques et l'enrichissement subsequent en isotopes (5-6 ‰ pour 15 N, 3-4 ‰ pour 13 C) sont semblables dans les cours d'eau enrichis naturellement ou artificiellement avec les carcasses de saumons. Cependant, les pourcentages d'assimilation d'azote et de carbone d'origine marine par des taxons particuliers peuvent souvent varier, probablement a cause de l'inefficacite du fractionnement ou du transfert. Nos resultats laissent croire que les voies d'entree du MDN dans le reseau alimentaire des cours d'eau incluent la consommation de tissus de saumons par les macroinvertebres et les poissons, ainsi que l'absorption du MDN mineralise par le biofilm. L'incorporation de MDN a de multiples niveaux trophiques souligne l'importance ecologique du retour annuel des poissons anadromes pour le maintien de la productivite des reseaux alimentaires d'eau douce.

AB  - Private standards and related certification schemes are becoming significant features of international fish trade and marketing. They have emerged in areas where there is a perception that public regulatory frameworks are not achieving the desired outcomes, such as sustainability and responsible fisheries management, or to ensure food safety, quality and environmental sustainability in the growing aquaculture industry. This report analyses the two main types of private standards, namely ecolabels and food safety and quality standards, their impact on fish trade and their implications for a range of stakeholders. It addresses issues that are driving the development of private standards, their policy and governance implications, the assessment of their credence, the costs implications, traceability, etc., and the challenges and opportunities for developing countries.

AB  - Abstract Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch from the Strait of Georgia were used to test the hypothesis that slower growing fish in their first ocean year had lower survival over the late fall and winter than faster growing fish. The Strait of Georgia provided a suitable area for this study because it is a semi-enclosed rearing area for juvenile Pacific salmon that is distinct from the open marine rearing areas off the west coast. Coho salmon that survived the winter had significantly larger spacing between circuli on scales, indicating that brood year strength is related to growth in the first marine year. Other studies have shown that smaller fish of a cohort are less able to survive periods of energy deficit than larger fish. Thus, size-related mortality in the first marine fall and winter may be an important determinant of brood year strength of some coho salmon stocks and stocks of other species of Pacific salmon.

AB  - Microbial Resistance to antibiotics is on the rise, in part because of inappropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine but also because of practices in the agricultural industry. Intensive animal production involves giving livestock animals large quantities of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent infection. These uses promote the selection of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. The resistant bacteria from agricultural environments may be transmitted to humans, in whom they cause disease that cannot be treated by conventional antibiotics. The author reviews trends in antibiotic use in animal husbandry and agriculture in general. The development of resistance is described, along with the genetic mechanisms that create resistance and facilitate its spread among bacterial species. Particular aspects of resistance in bacterial species common to both the human population and the agrifood industry are emphasized. Control measures that might reverse the current trends are highlighted.

AB  - To study the vertical distribution of fish that had been allowed to escape, farmed Atlantic salmon were tagged with acoustic tags equipped with depth sensors, and then released on five different dates in the course of a year from two fish farms in the Hardanger Fjord in western Norway. Release stimulated the fish to dive to deeper than 15 m during the first hours or days postrelease, often down to 50 –80 m. However, during the following 4 weeks, most of the escapees spent most of their time above the pycnocline at depths of 0– 4 m. The fish were more widely distributed in the water column after release during winter, but still spent most of the time in the cold surface layers. There was a wide range in the vertical distribution of individual fish, and the proportion of detections below 14-m depth ranged from 0 to 90%. There was a significant diurnal cycle in all seasons except midsummer, when the fish were less abundant in the upper layer during daylight, especially on brighter days. The results suggest that salmon diving activity following escape may complicate the recapture of escaped fish at the farm site but that the subsequent tendency of most fish to stay near the surface, virtually irrespective of the time of year, may facilitate recapture.

AB  - On 1 January 2017, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will enact a new rule ( 1 ) requiring countries exporting seafood to the United States to demonstrate that their fisheries comply with the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The United States is the world's largest seafood importer ( 2 ); the MMPA is among the world's strongest marine mammal protection laws; and most of the world's ∼125 marine mammal species are affected by fisheries bycatch (accidental entanglement in fishing gear) ( 3 ). This regulation could thus have significant conservation benefits, potentially spilling over to other areas of marine governance, if it is accompanied by substantial investments to boost scientific and compliance capacity in developing countries. Otherwise, it risks having little effect besides inflicting economic hardship on already poor communities.

1
Interactions between captive-reared and wild salmonids are frequent because hatcheries annually rear millions of fish for release in conservation programmes while many thousands of domesticated fish escape from fish farms. However, the outcome of competition between captive-reared and wild fish is not clear: wild fish may be smaller and less aggressive than hatchery fish, but they have more local experience and a prior residence advantage. Moreover, it is important to know whether any competitive differences are genetic (due to the process of domestication) or due to the rearing environment.

2
We therefore examined the factors influencing competition for feeding territories in juvenile Atlantic salmon. We studied the effect of domestication by using three independent stocks of both domesticated and wild-origin fish, all of which were reared in a common hatchery environment. We also used fish from the same wild stocks that had been living in the wild. Territorial contests were staged in stream tank compartments between pairs of fish differing in origin or rearing environment; the relative importance of body size and prior residence was also assessed.

3
All three stocks of domesticated fish were generally dominant over wild-origin fish when both had been raised in a common hatchery environment. If the wild-origin fish were given a 2-day period of prior residence on the territory this asymmetry in dominance was reversed. However, domesticated fish did not gain any additional advantage from being prior residents. The relative body size of the two contestants had a negligible effect on contest outcomes.

4
Truly wild fish (i.e. those of wild origin that had also grown up in the wild) were generally dominant over domesticated or wild-origin fish that had been hatchery-reared. Differences in body size between contestants had no effect on the outcome.

5
Synthesis and applications. These results show that, while juvenile farmed Atlantic salmon are inherently more aggressive than wild-origin fish, the hatchery environment reduces their ability to compete for territories with wild resident fish. Rearing salmon in conventional hatcheries for later release into the wild where natural populations already exist may not be a prudent conservation measure; it is preferable to plant eggs or first-feeding fry rather than attempt to ‘help’ the fish by rearing them through the early life stages.

AB  - Chile is the second largest producer of farmed salmon in the world. After reaching a peak harvest of 631 000 tonnes in 2008, a severe sanitary and production crisis triggered a major legal and operational reorganization, and an imminent expan- sion of the industry into the Aysen Fjords System (AFS). This expansion has caused increasing national and international concern about its potential negative impact upon this pristine area, which holds a mosaic of unique ecosystems and three World Biosphere Reserves. This paper reviews and provides some upper bounds to potential impacts under two feasible production scenarios. It is con- cluded that severe but highly localized mid-term damage to the sea-floor bottom may affect up to 6200 ha. Although this surface area represents only 0.5% of the AFS, the high heterogeneity and limited scientific knowledge of local ecosystems increase the risks of damaging sensitive habitats, communities or populations. While additional inputs of up to 60 000 t of nitrogen and 8000 t of phosphorus can be predicted, the estimation of carrying capacities is a pendant and urgent task to be accomplished in this area. If current escape rates are not reduced, the average number of escaped salmon may exceed 4.4 million individuals each year, able to consume up to 6600 t of pelagic prey from local ecosystems. We recom- mend following a strict precautionary approach, not granting new farming leases until sufficient information about the risk and magnitude of these impacts is obtained and transformed into effective management actions.

AB  - Aim  Globally, one of the major threats to the integrity of native faunas is the loss of biodiversity that can result from the introduction of exotics. Here we document recent changes in the distribution of five common fish species that are linked to introductions in Chile.



Location  Chile from 28° S to 54° S.



Methods  We assess the extent of changes in distribution of galaxiid species by comparing their historical and current distributions based on the results of the most extensive survey of freshwater fishes in Chile to date, a range that encompasses the full latitudinal and elevational range of the Galaxiidae in Chile. We test for relationships of the distributions and abundances of native fishes with the incidence of introduced species.



Results  The latitudinal range of Galaxias maculatus has declined by 26%, and most of this reduction has occurred in the northern part of its range. Aplochiton taeniatus and Brachygalaxias bullocki have experienced reductions (8–17% loss) in total drainage area occupied, and they have disappeared from, or are now extremely difficult to find, in latitudes 36° to 41° S, coincidently with areas of urban growth and intense economic activities. The distribution of Galaxias platei has, instead, increased considerably. In northern basins, G. maculatus has apparently been replaced by an introduced poeciliid Gambusia sp. High-elevation systems remain dominated by native Galaxias platei, whereas systems at intermediate elevations, especially rivers, are now dominated by introduced salmonids. Within drainages, native galaxiids remain abundant where exotic salmonid abundance is low.



Main conclusions  We suggest that negative interactions between introduced and native fish are responsible for some of the range reductions among Galaxiidae in Chile. The severity of the impacts varies with latitude and altitude and is probably related to temperature. The effects of Gambusia are restricted to warmer systems. Native fish also appear to have found temperature refugia from salmonids; impacts are low in the warmer northern and coastal systems, as well as in high-altitude relatively cold systems. Native fish also appear less vulnerable to salmonids in lakes than in rivers. This study identifies watersheds critical for the conservation of biodiversity within the Galaxiidae.

AB  - 1. Density-dependent factors appeared important for the survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon in the River Imsa whilst density-independent factors were more important for the older fish at sea. In fresh water, density dependence was indicated by a stock−recruitment relationship with increasing loss-rates from eggs to smolts and from eggs to adults as egg density increased. 73% of the loss-rates were explained by variation in egg density. At sea, density independence was indicated by the lack of a significant relationship between loss-rates and smolt densities.



2. The relationship between smolt density and initial egg density was best described by an asymptotic ‘Cushing’ type relationship with a plateau at densities higher than approximately 60 000 eggs for the total river areas of 10 000 m2. The number of smolts developed from the eggs spawned varied between 350 and 2400.



3. The relationship between smolt biomass in wet mass (kg 10 000 m−2) or energy (kJ 10 000 m−2) and the amount of salmon eggs in the River Imsa increased asymptotically. Annual smolt biomass ranged from 13 to 88 kg 10 000 m−2, or 66 000 and 431 000 kJ 10 000 m−2. Variation in egg density accounted for approximately 45% of the variation in smolt biomass (mass or energy).



4. Total wet mass and energy of adults (kg 10 000 m−2 and kJ 10 000 m−2) produced in relation to the amount of eggs at the start of the year-class, were not significantly correlated, due to a high variation among years. The biomass of adults ranged from 73 kg 10 000 m−2 to 655 kg 10 000 m−2 and in energy from 370 000 kJ 10 000 m−2 to 3 270 000 kJ 10 000 m−2.



5. Total adult biomass (adults caught at sea and in rivers) and the returning adults to the River Imsa in mass or energy were correlated with the size of the smolt cohort from which they originated. Yearly total adult biomass ranged between 240 and 3711 kg 10 000 m−2, when the number of smolts ranged from 397 to 2751, respectively. The biomass of adults returning to the River Imsa was between 59 and 614 kg, produced from between 672 and 1621 smolts.

AB  - The effects of salmon farm inputs on pelagic nutrient concentrations and planktonic mi- crobial abundance and biomass were investigated in Loch Fyne, a temperate fjordic environment off the west coast of Scotland. The concentration of photosynthetic pigments and inorganic and organic nutrients, and the abundance and biomass of the autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms, were determined over a complete annual cycle from 3 depths (5, 15 and 25-30 m) at 4 stations located at differing proximities to the fish farm. Ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations and heterotrophic microbial abundance and biomass were significantly higher at the stations nearest to the fish farm, suggesting that these and other nutrients derived from the fish farm may be directly or indirectly enhancing heterotrophic microbial activity. This in turn suggests that the heterotrophic microbial food web was responsible, at least in part, for processing matter and energy released into the pelagic environment from the salmon farm. By contrast, pigment concentrations, including chlorophyll a, tended to be similar at all stations, supporting the conclusions of previous studies that failed to estab- lish a clear relationship between fish farm inputs and phytoplankton biomass. As such, the response of the heterotrophic microbial community is probably a more appro-priate indicator than chlorophyll concentration of local ecological effects of fish farms in temperate coastal waters.

AB  - The effect of a shielding skirt, a tarpaulin mounted from the surface down to 5 meter depth around a net cage, on the flow pattern at a commercially stocked salmon cage was investigated. Dye was used as a tracer for water movement and the dye spreading was monitored using aerial images. Current meters were employed to investigate the flow close to the net inside and outside the cage. Tests were conducted with and without the shielding skirt. The focus was on the effectiveness of the shielding skirt to deflect water around the cage. This study shows that a shielding skirt can reduce horizontal flow components significantly inside a cage, which is related to a reduction of water exchange. The flow towards a cage is divided by a shielding skirt, i.e. some of the water is transported around the cage, while some is passing underneath the shielding skirt. Some water entering the fish cage from underneath the tarpaulin is transported towards the surface inside the cage. The use of a shielding skirt might not prevent interaction of the upper water layers inside and outside of a fish cage completely, but it has the potential to reduce the inflow of surface water into the cage, if deployed properly.Copyright © 2013 by ASME

AB  - China is the world's largest producer, consumer, processor, and exporter of finfish and shellfish (defined here as “fish”), and its fish imports are steadily rising ( 1 – 3 ). China produces more than one-third of the global fish supply, largely from its ever-expanding aquaculture sector, as most of its domestic fisheries are overexploited ( 3 – 6 ). Aquaculture accounts for ∼72% of its reported domestic fish production, and China alone contributes >60% of global aquaculture volume and roughly half of global aquaculture value ( 1 , 3 ).

AB  - Recent development literature on Latin America has discussed whether a ‘postneoliberal’ era has arrived. In this paper I argue that determining the arrival of a postneoliberal moment requires an examination of how capital crises are resolved by the state and the market to see whether institutions and the policy responses created by their interaction constitute a new approach to capital accumulation. After presenting geographical debates on crisis formation, I focus on the Infectious Salmon Anemia crisis that affected the Chilean salmon industry in 2008, and which raised questions about Chile's neoliberal success and global integration. Using interviews, press reports, and public data, I find that the policy responses that were implemented—namely, a new regulatory framework, increased state oversight, and geographical relocation—deepened Chile's trust in a neoliberal economy. This finding suggests that, at least in terms of environmental governance, we have not arrived at a postneoliberal moment.

AB  - Microorganisms contribute significantly to primary production, nutrient cycling, and decomposition in estuarine eco-systems; therefore, detrimental effects of pesticides on microbial species may have subsequent impacts on higher trophic levels. Pesticides may affect estuarine microorganisms via spills, runoff, and drift. Both the structure and the function of microbial communities may be impaired by pesticide toxicity. Pesticides may also be metabolized or bioaccumulated by microorganisms. Mechanisms of toxicity vary, depending on the type of pesticide and the microbial species exposed. Herbicides are generally most toxic to phototrophic microorganisms, exhibiting toxicity by disrupting photosynthesis. Atrazine is the most widely used and most extensively studied herbicide. Toxic effects of organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides on microbial species have also been demonstrated, although their mechanisms of toxicity in such nontarget species remain unclear. There is a great deal of variability in the toxicity of even a single pesticide among microbial species. When attempting to predict the toxicity of pesticides in estuarine ecosystems, effects of pesticide mixtures and interactions with nutrients should be considered. The toxicity of pesticides to aquatic microorganisms, especially bacteria and protozoa, is an area of research requiring further study.

AB  - ABSTRACTIn recent decades, aquaculture has emerged as a viable method to help supply the growing global demand for seafood; however, expansion of the industry comes with potential negative impacts. Regulatory decisions governing aspects like aquaculture farming practices and farm siting inherently lead to trade-offs between profitability and the health of the surrounding environment through impacts including pollution, disease, and disturbance from escaped fish. Efficiently and sustainably scaling up aquaculture will require the development of methods for explicitly examining the trade-offs among these impacts and socioeconomic objectives. We developed a model to assess these trade-offs and illustrate the approach with a case study of salmon aquaculture in southern Chile. In the case study we found evidence that all 21 farms with approved permits may be underperforming on both profitability and the protection of ecosystem health. Our model suggests that explicit evaluation of trade-offs can illuminate the...

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector and continues to expand alongside terrestrial crop and livestock production. Using portfolio theory as a conceptual framework, we explore how current interconnections between the aquaculture, crop, livestock, and fisheries sectors act as an impediment to, or an opportunity for, enhanced resilience in the global food system given increased resource scarcity and climate change. Aquaculture can potentially enhance resilience through improved resource use efficiencies and increased diversification of farmed species, locales of production, and feeding strategies. However, aquaculture’s reliance on terrestrial crops and wild fish for feeds, its dependence on freshwater and land for culture sites, and its broad array of environmental impacts diminishes its ability to add resilience. Feeds for livestock and farmed fish that are fed rely largely on the same crops, although the fraction destined for aquaculture is presently small (∼4%). As demand for high-value fed aquaculture products grows, competition for these crops will also rise, as will the demand for wild fish as feed inputs. Many of these crops and forage fish are also consumed directly by humans and provide essential nutrition for low-income households. Their rising use in aquafeeds has the potential to increase price levels and volatility, worsening food insecurity among the most vulnerable populations. Although the diversification of global food production systems that includes aquaculture offers promise for enhanced resilience, such promise will not be realized if government policies fail to provide adequate incentives for resource efficiency, equity, and environmental protection.

Genetic impact of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon (Sulmo salar L.) on native populations: use of DNA profiling to assess freshwater performance of wild, farmed, and hybrid progeny in a natural river environment. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 54: 998-1008. Since Atlantic salmon (Salmo salur L.) used for farming are usually genetically different from local wild populations, breeding of escaped farmed salmon potentially results in genetic changes in wild populations. To determine the likelihood and impact of such genetic change, an experiment was undertaken, in a natural spawning tributary of the Burrishoole system in western Ireland, to compare the performance of wild, farmed, and hybrid Atlantic salmon progeny. Juveniles were assigned to family and group parentage by DNA profiling based on composite genotypes at seven minisatellite loci. Survival of the progeny of farmed salmon to the smolt stage was significantly lower than that of wild salmon, with increased mortality being greatest in the period from the eyed egg to the first summer. However, progeny of farmed salmon grew fastest and competitively displaced the smaller native fish downstream. The offspring of farmed salmon showed a reduced incidence of male parr maturity compared with native fish. The latter also showed a greater tendency to migrate as autumn pre-smolts. Growth and performance of hybrids were generally either intermediate or not significantly different from the wild fish. The demonstration that farmed and hybrid progeny can survive in the wild to the smolt stage, taken together with unpublished data that show that these smolts can survive at sea and home to their river of origin, indicates that escaped farmed salmon can produce long-term genetic changes in natural populations. These changes affect both single-locus and high-heritability quantitative traits, e.g. growth, sea age of maturity. While some of these changes may be advantageous from an angling management perspective, they are likely, in specific circumstances, to reduce population fitness and productivity. Full assessment of these changes will require details of marine survival, homing and reproductive performance of the adults together with information on the F, generation. 0 1997 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea

AB  - Farm Atlantic salmon escape and invade rivers throughout the North Atlantic annually, which has generated growing concern about their impacts on native salmon populations. A large–scale experiment was therefore undertaken in order to quantify the lifetime success and interactions of farm salmon invading a Norwegian river. Sexually mature farm and native salmon were genetically screened, radio tagged and released into the River Imsa where no other salmon had been allowed to ascend. The farm fishes were competitively and reproductively inferior, achieving less than one–third the breeding success of the native fishes. Moreover, this inferiority was sex biased, being more pronounced in farm males than females, resulting in the principal route of gene flow involving native males mating with farm females. There were also indications of selection against farm genotypes during early survival but not thereafter. However, evidence of resource competition and competitive displacement existed as the productivity of the native population was depressed by more than 30%. Ultimately, the lifetime reproductive success (adult to adult) of the farm fishes was 16% that of the native salmon. Our results indicate that such annual invasions have the potential for impacting on population productivity, disrupting local adaptations and reducing the genetic diversity of wild salmon populations.

AB  - Concerns have been raised about the impact of farmed fish on wild fish through a range of mechanisms including disease and the impact of fish that escape from farms (1). Although Alaska has banned salmon farming and Washington has developed only a very small industry, British Columbia, with an extensive network of protected inlets, has developed a very large salmon-farming industry, now considerably bigger in terms of tons produced than the wild salmon production there. The salmon- farming industry is a significant and growing part of the local economy with the potential to grow to the scale that has occurred in Norway and Chile. In this issue of PNAS, Krkosek et al. (2) present data to show that migrating juvenile salmon are infected by sea lice as they pass salmon farms and that such sea lice infestations cause significant mortality. Their article provides support for those who oppose net-pen aquaculture of salmon within the range of wild salmon, and the results will undoubtedly intensify the debate on the impact of salmon farms on wild fish.

AB  - Abstract The fate of antibiotics in the environment, and especially antibiotics used in animal husbandry, is subject to recent studies and the issue of this review. The assumed quantity of antibiotics excreted by animal husbandry adds up to thousands of tonnes per year. Administered medicines, their metabolites or degradation products reach the terrestrial and aquatic environment by the application of manure or slurry to areas used agriculturally, or by pasture-reared animals excreting directly on the land, followed by surface run-off, driftage or leaching in deeper layers of the earth. The scientific interest in antimicrobially active compounds in manure and soil, but also in surface and ground water, has increased during the last decade. On the one side, scientific interest has focused on the behaviour of antibiotics and their fate in the environment, on the other hand, their impact on environmental and other bacteria has become an issue of research. Analytical methods have now been developed appropriately and studies using these new techniques provide accurate data on concentrations of antimicrobial compounds and their residues in different organic matters. Some antibiotics seem to persist a long time in the environment, especially in soil, while others degrade very fast. Not only the fate of these pharmaceuticals but their origin as well is an object of scientific interest. Besides human input via wastewater and other effluents, livestock production has been recognised as a source of contamination. One main concern with regard to the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock production is the potential promotion of resistance and the resulting disadvantages in the therapeutic use of antimicrobials. Since the beginning of antibiotic therapy, more and more resistant bacterial strains have been isolated from environmental sources showing one or multiple resistance. There have been several attempts to use antibiotic resistance patterns in different bacteria as indicators for various sources of faecal pollution. This review gives an overview of the available data on the present use of veterinary antibiotics in agriculture, on the occurrence of antibiotic compounds and resistant bacteria in soil and water and demonstrates the need for further studies.

AB  - Human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), the aggregate impact of land use on biomass available each year in ecosystems, is a prominent measure of the human domination of the biosphere. We present a comprehensive assessment of global HANPP based on vegetation modeling, agricultural and forestry statistics, and geographical information systems data on land use, land cover, and soil degradation that localizes human impact on ecosystems. We found an aggregate global HANPP value of 15.6 Pg C/yr or 23.8% of potential net primary productivity, of which 53% was contributed by harvest, 40% by land-use-induced productivity changes, and 7% by human-induced fires. This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species. We present maps quantifying human-induced changes in trophic energy flows in ecosystems that illustrate spatial patterns in the human domination of ecosystems, thus emphasizing land use as a pervasive factor of global importance. Land use transforms earth's terrestrial surface, resulting in changes in biogeochemical cycles and in the ability of ecosystems to deliver services critical to human well being. The results suggest that large-scale schemes to substitute biomass for fossil fuels should be viewed cautiously because massive additional pressures on ecosystems might result from increased biomass harvest.

AB  - Focusing on Marine Harvest ASA, the world's largest salmon producer, this article examines the role of corporations in promoting sustainable aquaculture and regulation, exploring why a leading multinational may choose to adopt and implement a proactive sustainability strategy. It develops a neo-pluralist model for conceptualizing drivers behind proactive strategy formation, and finds that a company-specific combination of simple and mixed motives linking profit-maximization and risk calculations to a longer-term normative sustainability agenda can explain why corporations become entrepreneurs for sustainability. It concludes with some reflections on implications of the findings for understanding business in environmental governance more broadly. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Abstract Commercial farming of Atlantic salmon in Scotland started in 1969 and has since expanded to produce > 179,000 t year − 1 . A government department has published annual statistics and information on the seawater and freshwater sub-sectors of the Scottish salmon farming industry since 1979, and this review collates and discusses metrics covering aspects of production, farm sites and systems, fish performance, socio-economics and environmental pressures. Trends illustrated in this case study of aquaculture development include: initial increases in numbers of farms and companies, followed by decreases due to industry consolidation; increases in average farm size, and productivity of systems and employees; increases in survival, size at age and productivity of fish (yield per smolt, ova per broodstock); reduced dependence on wild stocks for ova. This case study also illustrates the importance of disease management, control of biological processes to overcome natural seasonality (i.e. production of out-of-season smolt), and the international nature of aquaculture. Improvements in fish survival, growth and productivity are attributed to progress in vaccination and health management (including fallowing), husbandry, system design, feed formulation and provision, and introduction of technology and mechanisation. Salmon farming is discussed in relation to the challenging strategy of “sustainable intensification”. Improved growth and survival over a period of increasing rearing unit size, farm size and output and decreasing relative staff input counters the common assumption that intensification compromises animal welfare. The value of capturing time series data on industry wide metrics is illustrated as it enables identification of trends, underperformance and bench-marking, as well as assessment of resource use efficiency, environmental pressures, and ultimately sustainability. Statement of relevance This review is an original collation of a comprehensive set of time series of official statistics on an entire, discrete and regionally important sector of commercial aquaculture.

AB  - Signaling through the Ror2 receptor tyrosine kinase promotes invadopodia formation for tumor invasion. Here, we identify intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20) as a new target of this signaling in tumors that lack primary cilia, and find that IFT20 mediates the ability of Ror2 signaling to induce the invasiveness of these tumors. We also find that IFT20 regulates the nucleation of Golgi-derived microtubules by affecting the GM130-AKAP450 complex, which promotes Golgi ribbon formation in achieving polarized secretion for cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, IFT20 promotes the efficiency of transport through the Golgi complex. These findings shed new insights into how Ror2 signaling promotes tumor invasiveness, and also advance the understanding of how Golgi structure and transport can be regulated.

AB  - Releases of cultured organisms, such as farm Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), threaten native biodiversity and the integrity of natural communities. Salmon escaping from sea farms, however, have relatively poor reproductive success, suggesting that the rate of spread of domesticated traits may be reduced. We now compare the relative reproductive success of males that mature precociously in freshwater (parr) and find that those of farm origin have higher breeding and fertilization success than wild and hybrid individuals. Specifically, hybrid parr had 57% and wild parr 25% the success of farm parr. Early maturing males could thus be important vehicles promoting introgression of domesticated and/or non-native traits into wild populations and ultimately have longterm impact on the genetic integrity of native populations.

AB  - In the absence of effective national and intergovernmental regulation to ameliorate global environmental and social problems, “private” alternatives have proliferated, including self-regulation, corporate social responsibility, and public–private partnerships. Of the alternatives, “non-state market driven” (NSMD) governance systems deserve greater attention because they offer the strongest regulation and potential to socially embed global markets. NSMD systems encourage compliance by recognizing and tracking, along the market’s supply chain, responsibly produced goods and services. They aim to establish “political legitimacy” whereby firms, social actors, and stakeholders are united into a community that accepts “shared rule as appropriate and justified.” Drawing inductively on evidence from a range of NSMD systems, and deductively on theories of institutions and learning, we develop an analytical framework and a preliminary set of causal propositions to explicate whether and how political legitimacy might be achieved. The framework corrects the existing literature’s inattention to the conditioning effects of global social structure, and its tendency to treat actor evaluations of NSMD systems as static and strategic. It identifies a three-phase process through which NSMD systems might gain political legitimacy. It posits that a “logic of consequences” alone cannot explain actor evaluations: the explanation requires greater reference to a “logic of appropriateness” as systems progress through the phases. The framework aims to guide future empirical work to assess the potential of NSMD systems to socially embed global markets.

AB  - Abstract In this article, we provide an historical overview of Icelandic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming, wild stock management, and the often dichotomous philosophical bases for these activities. We then discuss how Iceland has sought to balance the benefits of salmon farming with the benefits of and risk to wild stock management, valuable recreational fisheries, and protection of native wild fish fauna. Under regulations enacted in 2001 and expanded in 2004, the coastline is zoned with respect to salmon cage-rearing; cage-rearing is not permitted in the bays and fjords into which the most valuable salmon rivers drain. The zoning is provided as a compromise between opposing views. As experience is gained from salmon farming in designated areas, this information will be used to plan future development of the cage rearing industry in Iceland.

AB  - Summary
The accelerated growth of finfish aquaculture has resulted in a series of developments detrimental to the environment and human health. The latter is illustrated by the widespread and unrestricted use of prophylactic antibiotics in this industry, especially in developing countries, to forestall bacterial infections resulting from sanitary shortcomings in fish rearing. The use of a wide variety of antibiotics in large amounts, including non-biodegradable antibiotics useful in human medicine, ensures that they remain in the aquatic environment, exerting their selective pressure for long periods of time. This process has resulted in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in aquaculture environments, in the increase of antibiotic resistance in fish pathogens, in the transfer of these resistance determinants to bacteria of land animals and to human pathogens, and in alterations of the bacterial flora both in sediments and in the water column. The use of large amounts of antibiotics that have to be mixed with fish food also creates problems for industrial health and increases the opportunities for the presence of residual antibiotics in fish meat and fish products. Thus, it appears that global efforts are needed to promote more judicious use of prophylactic antibiotics in aquaculture as accumulating evidence indicates that unrestricted use is detrimental to fish, terrestrial animals, and human health and the environment.

AB  - Summary 1. Pathogen transmission from open net-pen aquaculture facilities can depress sympatric wild fish populations. However, little is known about the effects of pathogen transmission from farmed fish on species interactions or other ecosystem components. Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch smolts are susceptible hosts to the parasitic salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis as well as a primary predator of juvenile pink Oncorhynchus gorbuscha salmon, a major host species for lice. 2. We used a hierarchical model of stock-recruit dynamics to compare coho salmon population dynamics across a region that varies in salmon louse infestation of juvenile coho and their pink salmon prey. 3. During a period of recurring salmon louse infestations in a region of open net-pen salmon farms, coho salmon productivity (recruits per spawner at low spawner abundance) was depressed approximately sevenfold relative to unexposed populations. Alternate hypotheses for the observed difference in productivity, such as declines in coho prey, perturbations to freshwater habitat or stochasticity, are unlikely to explain this pattern. 4. Lice parasitizing juvenile coho salmon were likely to be trophically transmitted during predation on parasitized juvenile pink salmon as well as directly transmitted from salmon farms. 5. Synthesis and applications. The finding that species interactions may cause the effects of pathogen transmission from farmed to wild fish to propagate up a marine food web has important conservation implications: (i) the management of salmon aquaculture should consider and account for species interactions and the potential for these interactions to intensify pathogen transmission from farmed to wild fish, (ii) the ecosystem impact of louse transmission from farmed to wild salmon has likely to have been previously underestimated and (iii) comprehensive monitoring of wild salmon and their population dynamics in areas of intensive salmon aquaculture should be a priority to determine if open net-pen salmon aquaculture is ecologically sustainable.

AB  - Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) seeks to biodiversify fed aquaculture (e.g. finfish or shrimps) with extractive aquaculture, recapturing the inorganic (e.g. seaweeds) and organic (e.g. suspension- and deposit-feeders) nutrients from fed aquaculture for their growth. The combination fed ⁄ extractive aquaculture aims to engineer food production systems providing both biomitigative services to the ecosystem and improved economic farm output through the co-cultivation of complementary species. Major rethinking is needed regarding the definition of an ‘aquaculture farm’ and how it works within an ecosystem. The economic values of the environmental ⁄ societal services of extractive species should be recognized and accounted for in the evaluation of the full value of these IMTA components. Seaweeds and invertebrates produced in IMTA systems should be considered as candidates for nutrient ⁄ carbon trading credits. While organic loading from aquaculture has been associated with localized benthic impacts, there have also been occurrences of increased biodiversity and abundance of wild species in response to moderate nutrient enrichment and the use of infrastructures as substrates. To develop efficient food production systems, it will be important to understand and use the duality of nutrients (essential when limiting ⁄ polluting when in excess) to engineer systems producing them in moderation so that they can be partially recaptured while maintaining their concentrations optimal for healthy and productive ecosystems. Measures of species diversity, colonization rates, abundance, growth and ecosystem functions with respect to nutrient partitioning and recycling, species interactions and control of diseases could represent valid indicators for the development of robust performance metrics.

AB  - Over the past decade conservation groups have put considerable effort into educating consumers and changing patterns of household consumption. Many groups aiming to reduce overfishing and encourage sustainable fishing practices have turned to new market-based tools, including consumer awareness campaigns and seafood certification schemes (e.g. the Marine Stewardship Council) that have been well received by the fishing and fish marketing industries and by the public in many western countries. Here, we review difficulties that may impede further progress, such as consumer confusion, lack of traceability and a lack of demonstrably improved conservation status for the fish that are meant to be protected. Despite these issues, market-based initiatives may have a place in fisheries conservation in raising awareness among consumers and in encouraging suppliers to adopt better practices. We also present several additional avenues for market-based conservation measures that may strengthen or complement current initiatives, such as working higher in the demand chain, connecting seafood security to climate change via life cycle analysis, diverting small fish away from the fishmeal industry into human food markets, and the elimination of fisheries subsidies. Finally, as was done with greenhouse gas emissions, scientists, conservation groups and governments should set seafood consumption targets.

AB  - Hunger and malnutrition remain among the most devastating problems facing the world's poor and needy, and continue to dominate the health and well-being of the world's poorest nations. Moreover, there are growing doubts as to the long-term sustainability of many existing food production systems, including capture fisheries and aquaculture, to meet the future increasing global demands. Of the different agricultural food production systems, aquaculture (the farming of aquatic animals and plants) is widely viewed as an important weapon in the global fight against malnutrition and poverty, particularly within developing countries where over 93% of global production is currently produced, providing in most instances an affordable and a much needed source of high quality animal protein, lipids, and other essential nutrients. The current article compares for the first time the development and growth of the aquaculture sector and capture fisheries by analyzing production by mean trophic level. Whereas marine capt...

AB  - A procedure previously used for sex steroids was adapted to extract free cortisol and cortisone from water samples taken from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss tanks. Both corticosteroids could be readily detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA), with cortisol being predominant. All stages of the sampling, extraction and RIA procedure were validated for cortisol. An intermittent problem with poor replication was traced to the use of diethyl ether during the extraction procedure, and was overcome by the use of ethyl acetate. Other modifications were also introduced to speed up the procedure. The concentration and time course of release of both corticosteroids were shown to be related to the degree of stress that the fish had been subjected to. It was confirmed that cortisol concentrations in water and estimated cortisol release rates increased in response to handling stress, and that both were correlated with plasma cortisol concentrations. The potential for using water cortisol concentration and release rates to assess the primary stress response of fishes as a non-invasive alternative to blood sampling is discussed.

AB  - In contrast to other major forms of livestock agriculture, there is a paucity of scientific information on the welfare of fish raised under intensive aquacultural conditions. This reflects an adherence to the belief that these animals have not evolved the salient biological characteristics that are hypothesised to permit sentience. In this review, we evaluate the scientific evidence for the existence of sentience in fish, and in particular, their ability to experience pain, fear and psychological stress. Teleost fish are considered to have marked differences in some aspects of brain structure and organization as compared to tetrapods, yet they simultaneously demonstrate functional similarities and a level of cognitive development suggestive of sentience. Anatomical, pharmacological and behavioural data suggest that affective states of pain, fear and stress are likely to be experienced by fish in similar ways as in tetrapods. This implies that fish have the capacity to suffer, and that welfare consideration for farmed fish should take these states into account. We suggest that the concept of animal welfare can be applied legitimately to fish. It is therefore appropriate to recognize and study the welfare of farmed fish.

AB  - Hatchery-reared 1-year-old Atlantic salmon post-smolts (Salmo salar L.), artificially infected with salmon lice [Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer)] copepodids, were found to suffer from primary alterations (increased cortisol levels) at early lice stages. Secondary alterations, such as osmotic stress (increased chloride levels), first occurred after the preadult stages of the lice appeared. Fish with the highest salmon lice infections died throughout the experiment. Seven years of field investigation of Trondheimsfjorden showed that Atlantic salmon post-smolts descending coastal waters can become heavily infected with salmon lice. The migrating post-smolts were only infected with the chalimus stages, showing that the fish had only recently left the rivers. The infection level, however, varied considerably between the years, and, in 1998, the infection was higher than previous years. The experimental results have been combined with the field data to appraise the consequences of the infection.

AB  - Many native Atlantic salmon populations have been invaded by domesticated escapees for three decades or longer. However, thus far, the cumulative level of gene-flow that has occurred from farmed to wild salmon has not been reported for any native Atlantic salmon population. The aim of the present study was to investigate temporal genetic stability in native populations, and, quantify gene-flow from farmed salmon that caused genetic changes where they were observed. This was achieved by genotyping historical and contemporary samples from 20 populations covering all of Norway with recently identified single nucleotide polymorphism markers that are collectively diagnostic for farmed and wild salmon. These analyses were combined with analysis of farmed salmon and implementation of Approximate Bayesian computation based simulations. Five of the populations displayed statistically significant temporal genetic changes. All five of these populations became more similar to a pool of farmed fish with time, strongly suggesting introgression of farmed fish as the primary cause. The remaining 15 populations displayed weak or non-significant temporal genetic changes. Estimated introgression of farmed fish ranged from 2-47% per population using approximate Bayesian computation. Thus, some populations exhibited high degrees of farmed salmon introgression while others were more or less unaffected. The observed frequency of escapees in each population was moderately correlated with estimated introgression per population R2 = 0.47 P < 0.001. Genetic isolation by distance existed within the historical and contemporary data sets, however, the among-population level of divergence decreased with time. This is the first study to quantify cumulative introgression of farmed salmon in any native Atlantic salmon population. The estimations demonstrate that the level of introgression has been population-specific, and that the level of introgression is not solely predicted by the frequency of escapees observed in the population. However, some populations have been strongly admixed with farmed salmon, and these data provide policy makers with unique information to address this situation.

AB  - Sex-biased dispersal is common in nature and can influence the way in which organisms are distributed throughout the environment with consequences at the individual, population, community, and species level. Much of our understanding of what drives sex-biased dispersal stems from work on birds and mammals where dispersal tends to be female and male biased, respectively. Here, we draw on this large body of empirical and theoretical work on vertebrates to investigate what drives breeding dispersal in an ectoparasite, the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis. We manipulated the density, sex, and developmental stage of lice on pairs of juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) hosts and show that the probability of leaving a host is density dependent at the preadult I stage and dependent on the presence of the opposite sex at preadult II and adult stages. Experiments in which louse movement was observed in groups of 25 individually infected hosts supported findings from individual experiments. Lice appeared to account for predation risk as they were 3 times more likely to disperse in the dark, when susceptibility to predation was low, than in the light. Our results support the hypothesis that asymmetry in reproductive investment shapes patterns of sex-biased dispersal and highlight the potential for drivers of dispersal to change with ontogeny. These findings are the first to establish what drives dispersal in the ecologically and economically important salmon louse and highlight the generality of the role mate competition plays in driving sex-biased dispersal across the animal kingdom.

AB  - Abstract Effective protection against sea lice ( Lepeoptheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus ) was documented over three years during the production of Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) in floating enclosures with water intake at 25 m depth. Moderate to high sea lice abundance in reference groups in open cages confirmed the presence of infective sea lice copepodites in the surface water around the cages. In the closed cages, sea lice were only recorded after fish had been moved between cages with well boats, or when the cages were stocked with fish transferred from open cages. When fish were exposed to sea lice in the closed cages, the recorded abundance was low and with no signs of sea lice reproduction within the cages. Records of mortality and growth during the test period indicate that production in closed sea cages is possible without adverse effects on survival or growth rates. Statement of relevance This study demonstrates how a new closed confinement technology provided an effective protection against sea lice ( L. salmonis and C. elongatus ), without adverse effects on survival or growth rates.

AB  - In contrast to mammalian therapeutics, the use of pharmaceutical substances is rather limited in fish. It is basically restricted to anaesthetic agents and anti-infective agents for parasitic and microbial diseases. Anaesthetic agents are used primarily in fish farm and laboratory settings to provide analgesia and immobilization of fish for minor procedures. The anti-infective agents are used for controlling diseases and the choice of drug depends on efficacy, ease of application, human safety, target animal safety including stress to the fish, environmental impact, regulatory approval, costs, and implications for marketing the fish. In this article, the major drugs used in salmonids in North America and Europe will be reviewed and some insight into future directions for drug development and use for the salmonid industry will be introduced. The mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, side effects, and uses of the drugs are emphasized.

AB  - ￻￻ ￻ Fishes farmed in sea pens may become infested by parasites from wild fishes and in turn become point sources for parasites. Sea lice, copepods of the family Caligidae, are the best-studied example of this risk. Sea lice are the most significant parasitic pathogen in salmon farming in Europe and the Americas, are estimated to cost the world industry E300 million a year and may also be pathogenic to wild fishes under natural conditions. Epizootics, characteristically dominated by juvenile (copepodite and chalimus) stages, have repeatedly occurred on juvenile wild salmonids in areas where farms have sea lice infestations, but have not been recorded elsewhere. This paper synthesizes the literature, including modelling studies, to provide an understanding of how one species, the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, can infest wild salmonids from farm sources. Three-dimensional hydrographic models predicted the distribution of the planktonic salmon lice larvae best when they accounted for wind-driven surface currents and larval behaviour. Caligus species can also cause problems on farms and transfer from farms to wild fishes, and this genus is cosmopolitan. Sea lice thus threaten finfish farming worldwide, but with the possible exception of L. salmonis, their host relationships and transmission adaptations are unknown. The increasing evidence that lice from farms can be a significant cause of mortality on nearby wild fish populations provides an additional challenge to controlling lice on the farms and also raises conservation, economic and political issues about how to balance aquaculture and fisheries resource management.

AB  - Deleterious genetic change in wild anadromous salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) is expected from fisheries differentially harvesting fish that spawn at particular times within a season, mature at particular sizes or ages, or grow at particular rates. Other sources include overfishing, habitat degradation or destruction, and interactions with hatchery fish, particularly when these phenomena severely reduce population size. Gene flow from hatchery to wild fish populations also is deleterious because hatchery populations genetically adapt to the unnatural conditions of the hatchery environment at the expense of adaptation for living in natural streams. This domestication is significant even in the first generation of hatchery rearing. Spawner-recruit theory serves as a framework for discussing the consequences of deleterious genetic change. This theory can illustrate how the fitness or productivity of a population is reduced and whether genetic change is largely offset by natural selection within one generation, or accumulates over many generations. Although our knowledge is far from complete, sufficient information exists to demand actions to reduce or avoid deleterious genetic change. As additional information becomes available, these actions may be changed, perhaps relaxed. One suggested action is to establish or maintain “refuge” populations of wild fish that are to be protected from habitat degradation, selective or intense fishing, and interactions with hatchery fish.

AB  - Soil has been regarded as a rich source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) due to the complex microbial community and diverse antibiotic-producing microbes in soil, however, little is known about the ARGs in unculturable bacteria. To investigate the diversity and distribution of ARGs in soil and assess the impact of agricultural practice on the ARGs, we screened soil metagenomic library constructed using DNA from four different agricultural soil for ARGs. We identified 45 clones conferring resistance to minocycline, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. The similarity of identified ARGs with the closest protein in GenBank ranged from 26% to 92%, with more than 60% of identified ARGs had low similarity less than 60% at amino acid level. The identified ARGs include aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, ADP-ribosyl transferase, ribosome protection protein, transporters and other antibiotic resistant determinants. The identified ARGs from the soil with manure application account for approximately 70% of the total ARGs in this study, implying that manure amendment may increase the diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in soil bacteria. These results suggest that antibiotic resistance in soil remains unexplored and functional metagenomic approach is powerful in discovering novel ARGs and resistant mechanisms.

AB  - Rainbow trout is economically the most important cultivated fish in Finland. In this study, new knowledge on the energy consumption, emissions and environmental impacts caused by the production of rainbow trout in Finland was generated. Methodologically the work was based on life cycle assessment (LCA) beginning from the extraction of raw materials and ending with the delivery of gutted fish to the retailers or for further processing. The environmental performances of production methods with different feeds, feed coefficients and technical emission reduction measures were assessed. The environmental impact assessment revealed that atmospheric emissions - originating mainly from the feed raw material production, feed manufacturing and transportation - make only a minor contribution to the total environmental impacts caused by the production of rainbow trout in Finland. Phosphorus and nitrogen emissions from fish farms to waters are the most significant emissions from the point of view of the total environmental impacts. By using new, environmentally friendly feeds with increased feed efficiency it is possible to decrease the nitrogen and phosphorus loads significantly. Technical measures to decrease nutrient emissions to the waters reduce the phosphorus load but have only a minor effect on nitrogen. Energy consumption and the use of renewable energy sources proved to be one of the key indicators for developing more sustainable aquacultural practices in Finland, although the major share of energy consumption associated with the production of rainbow trout takes place outside Finland.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the impact of firm size and price variability on firm profitability in the Norwegian salmon farming industry using a panel data set of all companies from the period 2000 to 2014. Several proxies for firm size are included in the analysis. We find that firm’s share of total sales has a positive impact on profitability, while an alternative proxy, total assets, is negatively linked to profitability. Financial leverage (gearing) has a negative impact, but liquidity (current assets/current liabilities) is not found to significantly affect profitability. Operating efficiency indicators like working capital management (net working capital/total assets) and operating leverage (fixed assets/total assets) are positively associated with profitability. Finally, we find that salmon price variability increases profitability, and that smaller companies are more able to take advantage of the profit opportunities that price variability offer, compared to larger companies.

AB  - Jonsson, B. 1997. A review of ecological and behavioural interactions between cultured and wild Atlantic salmon. ~ ICES Journal of Marine Science, 54: 1031-1039. Cultured Atlantic salmon (Salvo salar L.) may be introduced into natural systems intentionally or accidentally. As smolts or post-smolts, they move to the feeding areas of wild salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean. As maturing fish, they return to the area of release and enter rivers to spawn. Lack of juvenile river experience is the prime reason why cultured salmon often enter fresh water later in the season than wild fish. During spawning, cultured female salmon from fish farms make fewer nests, tend to breed for a shorter period of time, are poorer at nest covering, and retain greater amounts of unspawned eggs than wild females. Cultured male salmon from fish farms exhibit less combat and display behaviour, have greater difficulty in acquiring access to mates, show less quivering and courting behaviour, and have lower reproductive success than wild males. However, cultured male salmon are more involved in prolonged, reciprocal fights than wild males and are, therefore, more often wounded. The reproductive success of cultured salmon increases with the time the fish have lived in nature before maturing sexually; for cultured females released in nature at the smolt stage, reproductive success is similar to that of wild females. The relative reproductive success of cultured males is smaller than that of corresponding females. Within both sexes of cultured and wild salmon, competitive spawning ability increases with body size. As a phenotypic response to increased growth rate during the first year of life, cultured salmon tend to have smaller sized but more numerous eggs than wild fish of the same size. Offspring of cultured salmon are more generally aggressive, more risk prone, and have a higher growth rate than wild offspring. Consequently, their survival rate in nature may be lower. mc 1997 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea

AB  - The evolution of bacterial pathogens towards antibiotic resistance is not just a relevant problem for human health, but a fascinating example of evolution that can be studied in real time as well. Although most antibiotics are natural compounds produced by environmental microbiota, exposure of bacterial populations to high concentrations of these compounds as the consequence of their introduction for human therapy (and later on for farming) a few decades ago is a very recent situation in evolutionary terms. Resistance genes are originated in environmental bacteria, where they have evolved for millions of years to play different functions that include detoxification, signal trafficking or metabolic functions among others. However, as the consequence of the strong selective pressure exerted by antimicrobials at clinical settings, farms and antibiotic-contaminated natural ecosystems, the selective forces driving the evolution of these potential resistance determinants have changed in the last few decades. Natural ecosystems contain a large number of potential resistance genes; nevertheless, just a few of them are currently present in gene-transfer units and disseminated among pathogens. Along the review, the processes implied in this situation and the consequences for the future evolution of resistance and the environmental microbiota are discussed.

AB  - Salmon farms are spatially concentrated reservoirs of fish host populations that can disrupt natural salmonid host-parasite dynamics. Sea lice frequently infect farm salmon and parasitize sympatric wild juvenile salmonids, with neg- ative impacts on survival in Europe and Pacific Canada. We examined louse parasitism of wild juvenile chum salmon (On- corhynchus keta) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from three salmon farming regions in British Columbia (Finlayson, Broughton Archipelago, and Georgia Strait). We compared sites of low and high exposure to farms and in- cluded an area without farms (Bella Bella) to assess baseline infection levels. Louse prevalence and abundance were low- est and most similar to natural baseline levels at low-exposure sites and highest at high-exposure sites in all farm regions. A significantly greater proportion of the lice were Lepeophtheirus salmonis at high-exposure sites. Exposure to salmon farms was the only consistently significant factor to explain the variation in prevalence data, with a secondary role played by salinity. Our results support the hypothesis that salmon farms are a major source of sea lice on juvenile wild salmon in salmon farming regions and underscore the importance of using management techniques that mitigate threats to wild stocks. Resume´ : Les elevages de saumons sont des reservoirs concentres dans l'espace de populations de poissons hotes qui peu- vent perturber la dynamique naturelle des saumons hotes et de leurs parasites. Les puces de mer infectent frequemment les saumons d'elevage et parasitent les jeunes salmonides sauvages sympatriques, ce qui a des impacts negatifs sur la survie en Europe et la region pacifique du Canada. Nous avons etudiele parasitisme par les puces de mer chez les saumons keta (Oncorhynchus keta) et roses (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) dans trois regions d'elevage de saumons en Colombie- Britannique (Finlayson, archipel de Broughton et detroit de Georgie). Nous avons compareles sites fortement et faiblement exposes aux elevages, ainsi qu'une region sans elevages (Bella Bella), afin d'evaluer les niveaux d'infection de base. La prevalence et l'abondance des puces de mer sont minimales et le plus semblables aux niveaux de base naturels aux sites de faible exposition, et maximales aux sites de forte exposition dans toutes les regions d'elevage. Aux sites de forte expo- sition, une proportion significativement plus elevee des puces de mer appartient al'espece Lepeophtheirus salmonis. L'ex- position aux elevages de saumons est le seul facteur explicatif constamment significatif dans les donnees de prevalence avec la salinitequi joue un role secondaire. Nos resultats appuient l'hypothese selon laquelle les elevages de saumons sont une source importante de puces de mer pour les jeunes saumons sauvages dans les regions d'elevage de saumons et ils soulignent l'importance d'utiliser des techniques de gestion qui reduisent les menaces aux stocks sauvages.

AB  - Stewart C. Johnson, Jim W. Treasurer, Sandra Bravo, Kazuya Nagasawa, and Zbigniew Parasitic copepods are common on cultured and wild marine finfish, and there is a substantive literature describing their taxonomy, life cycles, and host ranges. Although many species have long been recognized to have the potential to affect the growth, fecundity, and survival of their hosts, it has only been with the development of semi-intensive and intensive aquaculture that their importance as disease-causing agents has become evident. Members of the family Caligidae are the most commonly reported species on fish reared in brackish and marine waters. These species, often referred to as sea lice, are responsible for most disease outbreaks. The impacts of sea lice on marine salmonid aquaculture are well documented, with catastrophic losses reported for disease outbreaks that have resulted in high levels of mortality. With the development of a variety of treatments and management strategies to reduce infection levels, mortality caused by sea lice has been greatly reduced. At present, economic losses due to sea lice are primarily from the costs of treatments, the costs of the management strategies, the costs associated with reduced growth rates that are a direct result of infection and/or treatment, and the costs of carcass downgrading at harvest. Indirect and direct losses due to sea lice in salmonid aquaculture globally are estimated to be greater than US$100 million annually. In other areas of marine aquaculture, the impact of parasitic copepods is not well documented. This is especially true for species such as Atlantic halibut, Atlantic cod, turbot, and haddock that have only recently entered commercialscale production. This review discusses the global importance of parasitic copepods as disease-causing agents in marine aquaculture. We also provide a brief review of the environmental and husbandry factors that may affect parasitic copepod abundance and the potential roles that parasitic copepods play as vectors for other disease agents.

AB  - Summary: Entry to and exit from contaminated premises - by animal health personnel, workers, owners, wildlife, insects, domestic animals and rodents present a risk of disease spread which demands constant attention. The least expensive means of controlling and eliminating the risk of introducing virus and bacteria involves maintaining constant biosecurity programmes. These documented biosecurity measures and procedures must never be compromised by anyone, including the owners of premises.

AB  - Environmental effects of economic activities are ultimately driven by consumption, via impacts of the production, use, and waste management phases of products and services ultimately consumed. Integrated product policy (IPP) addressing the life-cycle impacts of products forms an innovative new generation of environmental policy. Yet this policy requires insight into the final consumption expenditures and related products that have the greatest life-cycle environmental impacts. This review article brings together the conclusions of 11 studies that analyze the life-cycle impacts of total societal consumption and the relative importance of different final consumption categories. This review addresses in general studies that were included in the project Environmental Impacts of Products (EIPRO) of the European Union (EU), which form the basis of this special issue. Unlike most studies done in the past 25 years on similar topics, the studies reviewed here covered a broad set of environmental impacts beyond just energy use or carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The studies differed greatly in basic approach (extrapolating LCA data to impacts of consumption categories versus approaches based on environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) tables), geographical region, disaggregation of final demand, data inventory used, and method of impact assessment. Nevertheless, across all studies a limited number of priorities emerged. The three main priorities, housing, transport, and food, are responsible for 70% of the environmental impacts in most categories, although covering only 55% of the final expenditure in the 25 countries that currently make up the EU. At a more detailed level, priorities are car and most probably air travel within transport, meat and dairy within food, and building structures, heating, and (electrical) energy-using products within housing. Expenditures on clothing, communication, health care, and education are considerably less important. Given the very different approaches followed in each of the sources reviewed, this result hence must be regarded as extremely robust. Recommendations are given to harmonize and improve the methodological approaches of such analyses, for instance, with regard to modeling of imports, inclusion of capital goods, and making an explicit distinction between household and government expenditure. © 2006 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.

AB  - The lifetime success and performance characteristics of communally reared offspring of wild native Burrishoole (native), ranched native (ranched) and non-native (non-native) Atlantic salmon Salmo salar from the adjacent Owenmore River were compared. Non-native 0+ year parr showed a substantial downstream migration, which was not shown by native and ranched parr. This appears to have been an active migration rather than competitive displacement and may reflect an adaptation to environmental or physiographic conditions within the Owenmore River catchment where the main nursery habitat is downstream of the spawning area. There were no differences between native and ranched in smolt output or adult return. Both of these measures, however, were significantly lower for the non-native group. A greater proportion of the non-native Atlantic salmon was taken in the coastal drift nets compared to the return to the Burrishoole system, probably as a result of the greater size of the non-native fish. The overall lifetime success of the non-native group, from fertilized egg to returning adult, was some 35% of native and ranched. The ranched group showed a significantly greater male parr maturity, a greater proportion of 1+ year smolts, and differences in sex ratio and timing of freshwater entry of returning adults compared to native, which may have fitness implications under specific conditions.

AB  - Oxytetracycline (OT) is used extensively in the treatment of bacterial diseases in marine f~sh . The standard dose recommended for treatment of fish is 5 to 10 times higher than doses commonly used in medical practice, indicating that OT is poorly absorbed. This is especially true for fish held in sea water, where the intestinal uptake is substantially reduced as compared to fish in fresh water. OT forms complexes with magnesium and calc~um We have determined the con~plex constants and calculated that when therapeutic concentrations of OT are present in sea water, only about 5 O/O of the OT exists in the free form. Of the bound OT, the 1:l OT-magnesium complex predominates. The complex formation in sea water results in a strong reduction in the antibacterial effect of OT This has been demonstrated in vitro. The poor intestinal uptake and reduced antibacterial effect of complex-bound OT is caused by an alteration of the molecular charge that diminishes its ability to cross lipid-rich biological membranes. A major portion of the OT administered to farmed salmonids inevitably ends up in the environment, especially in the sediments under aquaculture facilities. No mechanism is known for biodegradation of OT and thus it can remain in the sediments long enough to affect the indigenous bacterial flora and induce resistance. For these reasons the use of OT in marine environments should be questioned.

AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is currently the highest valued species grown in Europe. The industry has been on the frontline of public concerns regarding sustainability which has increased the use of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Salmon has changed from a luxury product to global commodity. Nevertheless, food products need to meet consumers demand for the industry to be successful. Descriptive sensory tests present a sophisticated tool for the comparison of product prototypes to understand consumer responses in relation to sensory attributes. Aquaculture is being promoted in the Basque region with the aim of creating a sustainable and complementary economic activity to the fishing and seafood sectors. Here, RAS and salmon have been prioritized as a potential technology and species respectively. Both salmon's growth and a hedonic evaluation of the final product's consumer acceptance and purchasing intention were studied. One thousand five hundred salmon individuals were grown for 497 days at two different thermal regimes in two pilot-scale RAS units using partial reuse water recirculation systems. Growth rates were significantly different for both temperature regimes during the second summer season; some compensatory growth patterns were observed that followed the timing of the natural thermal regime. No significant differences were observed at sensorial level between fillet samples from the present study and salmon from Denmark. Consumer's high level of acceptance and positive product purchasing intention reflect the possibility of locally marketing RAS grown salmon. This study refers to the first technical attempt at salmon in land-based aquaculture systems in northern Spain.

AB  - Otherwise well-researched definitions of breeding objectives and selection criteria may never be used in practice if those definitions do not take into account the perceptions and wishes of the breeders for whom they are designed. Finding selection criteria that are widely accepted and implemented is a daunting task that requires considerable time and full interaction between the scientists and the industry. We review various aspects of this process and, in particular, how scientific principles can be used to ensure that the outcome best meets both the perceptions and needs of the users while remaining as close as possible to the technical economic optimum. Alternative methods of presenting and delivering selection indexes, such as index expression, index formulation, focus on response to selection rather than on index weights, construction of component indexes, and the use of direct accounting for costs of constraints rather than rescaling methods can all help in improving acceptance of an index. Development and implementation of selection criteria also involve consideration of the selective mating decisions that form an integral part of selection decisions in the field. The technical basis of factors that foster emphasis on individual mating decisions in the field are discussed in relation to formulation of the breeding goal and selection index and in relation to nonlinear economic and genetic parameters. Strategies that focus on use of a linear index for the selection of sires and dams followed by selective mating of selected parents have the greatest potential for implementation in the industry. We focus on examples taken from the Canadian dairy industry, but principles apply generally.

AB  - The vast majority of antibiotic resistant genes (ARG) acquired by human pathogens have originated from the natural environment. Therefore, understanding factors that influence intrinsic levels of ARG in the environment could be epidemiologically significant. The selection for metal resistance often promotes AR in exposed organisms; however, the relationship between metal levels in nature and the intrinsic presence of ARG has not been fully assessed. Here, we quantified, using qPCR, the abundance of eleven ARG and compared their levels with geochemical conditions in randomly selected soils from a Scottish archive. Many ARG positively correlated with soil copper levels, with approximately half being highly significant (p<0.05); whereas chromium, nickel, lead, and iron also significantly correlated with specific ARG. Results show that geochemical metal conditions innately influence the potential for AR in soil. We suggest soil geochemical data might be used to estimate baseline gene presence on local, regional and global scales within epidemiological risk studies related to AR transmission from the environment.

AB  - The loss of sensitivity to emamectin benzoate recorded in Caligus rogercresseyi in the Region X in Chile (41o46'S72o56'W; 43o07'S73o38'W) has been aributed to the exclusive use of this product to control sea lice for more than seven years. In order to evaluate the sensitivity through successive generations of lice, a study was carried out between August 2006 and April 2007. Seven successive generations from a presumably resistant population of C. rogercresseyi were cultivated in the laboratory without the selection pressure of the antiparasitic drug. Results of the bioassay applied to the progenies showed that there was no recovery of sensitivity over the seven inbred generations studied. This may point to a long-standing resistance problem against emamectin benzoate.

AB  - There is growing societal and scientific interest in the welfare status of fish used for commercial enterprise. As animal welfare is primarily concerned with the quality of life of a conscious, sentient organism, the question of whether fishes are even capable of consciousness must first be addressed in order to assess their welfare status. Recently, there has been a resurgence of research investigating the biological basis for human consciousness, and our current understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying fish behaviour has likewise improved significantly. Combined, these research perspectives create an opportunity to better comprehend the phylogeny of traits associated with consciousness, as well as the emergence of consciousness itself during vertebrate evolution. Despite the availability of this literature, contemporary reviews or published studies investigating the probability of conscious states occurring in fishes often do so without considering new perspectives or data. In this paper, we review and critique recent publications that report equivocal conclusions favouring the absence or presence of consciousness in various fishes. By introducing other data into these analyses, we demonstrate that there are alternative perspectives which support the existence of consciousness in fishes as a plausible concept. An accurate assessment of the mental capacity of fishes will require enhanced knowledge of their forebrain neuroanatomy, an understanding of how such structures mediate behavioural responses, and an analysis of that information within the context of contemporary theory related to the evolution of consciousness in higher vertebrates.

AB  - A harmful algal bloom (HAB) of the raphidophyta alga Pseudochattonella cf. verruculosa during the 2016 austral summer (February-March) killed nearly 12% of the Chilean salmon production, causing the worst mass mortality of fish and shellfish ever recorded in the coastal waters of western Patagonia. The HAB coincided with a strong El Nino event and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode that altered the atmospheric circulation in southern South America and the adjacent Pacific Ocean. This led to very dry conditions and higher than normal solar radiation reaching the surface. Using time series of atmospheric, hydrologic and oceanographic data we show here that an increase in surface water temperature and reduced freshwater input resulted in a weakening of the vertical stratification in the fjords and sounds of this region. This allowed the advection of more saline and nutrient-rich waters, ultimately resulting in an active harmful algal bloom in coastal southern Chile.

AB  - Eutrophication is one of the most severe and widespread forms of disturbance affecting coastal marine systems. Whilst there are general models of effects on benthos, such as the Pearson-Rosenberg (P-R) model, the models are descriptive rather than predictive. Here we first review the process of increased organic matter production and the ensuing sedimentation to the seafloor. It is shown that there is no simple relationship between nutrient inputs and the vertical flux of particulate organic matter (POM). In particular, episodic hydrographic events are thought to be the key factor leading to high rates of sedimentation and accompanying hypoxia. We extend an earlier review of effects of hypoxia to include organisms living in the water column. In general, fishes are more sensitive to hypoxia than crustaceans and echinoderms, which in turn are more sensitive than annelids, whilst molluscs are the least sensitive. Growth is affected at oxygen concentrations between 6.0 and 4.5 mg O 2 l -1 , other aspects of metabolism are affected at between 4 and 2 mg O 2 l -1 and mortality occurs where concentrations are below 2.0 to 0.5 mg O 2 l -1 . Field studies, however, show that complex behavioural changes also occur as hypoxia increases, and these are described herein. The areas where hypoxia occurs are frequently areas that are stagnant or with poor water exchange. Thus again, hydrographic factors are key processes determining whether or not hypoxia and eutrophication occur. Tolerance to ammonia and hydrogen sulphide is also reviewed, as these substances are found at near zero concentrations of oxygen and are highly toxic to most organisms. However, the effects of interactions between oxygen, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide only occur below oxygen concentrations of ca. 0.5 mg O 2 l -1 , since only below this concentration are hydrogen sulphide and oxygen released into the water. Models of eutrophication and the generation of hypoxia are discussed, and in particular the P-R model is analysed. Although agreement with the model is widely reported the actual predictions of the model have rarely been tested. Our review suggests that the major effects on benthic fauna result from hypoxia rather than organic enrichment per se and suggests that the P-R model is descriptive rather than predictive. Finally, a managerial tool is proposed, based on the stages of effects of hypoxia and organic enrichment suggested by the P-R model and on an earlier study. The proposed strategy involves rapid assessment tools and indicates where more detailed surveys are needed. Managers are advised that remedial action will not produce rapid results and that recovery from eutrophication will probably take decades. Thus it is essential to detect potential hypoxia and eutrophication effects at early stages of development.

AB  - Summary 1. Parasites can influence ecosystem structure, function and dynamics by mediating predator–prey interactions. Recurrent infestations of the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis associated with salmon aquaculture may mediate interactions between juvenile salmonids. Louse infection increases pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha susceptibility to predation, resulting in the trophic transmission of lice (with an adult male bias) to coho salmon O. kisutch predators. While experimental evidence is accumulating, the extent to which trophic transmission structures the distribution of lice among juvenile salmon in the wild is unknown. 2. We used a hierarchical modelling approach to examine the abundance and sex ratio of salmon lice on juvenile pink and coho salmon, collected from a region of salmon aquaculture during sea louse infestations, to test the hypothesis that trophic transmission of salmon lice increases infection on coho that feed upon infected pink salmon prey. 3. As predicted, coho had higher adult and pre-adult louse abundance than their pink salmon prey, and louse abundance was more adult male biased on predators than sympatric prey. We estimate that trophic transmission accounts for 53–67% of pre-adult and adult louse infection on coho. 4. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that, by evading predation, salmon lice can accumulate up juvenile salmon food webs. Predators, such as coho, can experience a two- to threefold increase in parasite exposure through predation on infected prey than would otherwise occur through passive exposure to infective larvae. Thus, predation may intensify parasite exposure and undermine the protection to ectoparasites conferred by the larger body size of predators. For larger predatory wild juvenile salmon, the risk of louse transmission from farmed salmon may therefore be greater than previously appreciated. These findings argue for an ecosystem perspective in monitoring and managing the marine environment in areas of intensive salmon aquaculture that includes the productivity and ecological interactions of all salmonid species.

AB  - Nutrients do not, in themselves, influence man’s use of estuaries. It is the secondary effect of the nutrients in stimulating the growth of aquatic plants, primarily the unicellular algae or phytoplankton, that make enrichment important to man. Such algal growth is usually thought of in quantitative terms: moderate amounts are good for most uses, since algae are the base of the food chains that nourish most forms of estuarine life, while too much enrichment and plant growth result in the familiar esthetic and ecological problems that are associated with the term “eutrophication.” But, more and more, we have begun to view the effects of enrichment in qualitative terms, because we now recognize that, in fact, it is not the quantity but the kinds of algae that are good or bad for man’s purposes.

AB  - The New Brunswick Bay of Fundy salmon aquaculture industry expanded from 6 t in 1980 to 16 380 t in 1995. With the growth of the industry came an increase in the frequency of escaped cultured salmon entering and spawning in fresh water. Since 1992, the Magaguadavic River, located in the centre of the New Brunswick salmon aquaculture industry, has been monitored to show changes in the proportions of wild and escaped cultured salmon entering the river. Wild salmon numbers steadily declined over 5 years, whereas cultured salmon numbers generally increased. Cultured salmon entered the river later than wild salmon and the majority of cultured salmon were sexually immature. Present ratios of multi-sea-winter to one-sea-winter for wild salmon are 0.4: 1, compared with 2: 1 a decade earlier. Eggs were sampled from 20 redds in the Magaguadavic River in 1993. Analysis of carotenoid pigments revealed that 45% of the redds were made by females of definite wild origin, at least 20% by females of definite cultured origin, and the remaining 35% contained eggs with pigments indicating a possibility of cultured origin. Thus, redds of cultured escapees could be as high as 55% of the total examined. The location of the Magaguadavic River, and the availability of data on wild and cultured salmon in the river dating back to 1992, make this an ideal site for a Canadian reference river to monitor interactions between wild and cultured salmon. 0 1997 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea

AB  - This study has investigated the effect of salinity and temperature on the rates of uptake of Cd and Zn by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis under laboratory conditions. Exposure of mussels to concentrations of 2 ppm resulted in an almost linear increase in the concentration of Cd and Zn throughout 14 days of exposure. Only the whole soft tissue of each mussel was frozen, freeze-dried and acid- digested before measuring the level of contamination by the spectrophotometer. Zn uptake was interrupted by elimination periods at high salinity. The uptake of Cd by M. edulis was at its maximum at low salinity and high temperature while at high salinity, temperature did not significantly affect the rate of uptake. Salinity had a significant effect on Zn uptake with the rate of uptake being higher at low salinity. Mortalities of mussels exposed to Cd and Zn along with controls were only observed at low salinity.

AB  - Recent clinical and epidemiological information, an analysis of the literature, and study of the technical aspects of Chilean salmon aquaculture indicate that this activity has the ability to expand the range of diphyllobothriasis caused by the fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum. Evidence for expansion of the range of the fish tapeworm includes the emergences of clinical cases in Brazil related to consumption of salmon produced in Chile. Expansion of the range of this parasite is also suggested by an increase of its geographical range in Chile, beyond its previously endemic foci in the lakes of Regions IX and X. Prevention of further dissemination of this parasitic disease rests on an improvement of sanitation and sewage disposal around the lakes of Regions IX, X and XI in Chile, improvement in aquaculture methods including curtailing the use of fish tapewormcontaminated lakes to grow juveniles forms of salmonids and more measures to decrease the number of salmonid escapees from marine pens to prevent their return to rivers and lakes carrying the infestation. Moreover, tracking the origin of juveniles in marketed salmon, determining the presence of plerocercoids in them, and increased education of the public regarding the potential dangers of eating raw fish should also be implemented. Only by stimulating the dialogue between the industry, consumers and state regulators will it be possible to implement appropriate measures to prevent further expansion of this parasitic disease by salmon aquaculture (Rev Med Chile 2007; 135: 1064-71).

AB  - Abstract A simultaneous-equation equilibrium model of international salmonid markets is used to examine the combined effect of variability in the landings of Alaska's sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka and increases in the production of Chile's Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, coho salmon O. kisutch, and rainbow trout O. mykiss on Alaska's sockeye salmon exvessel prices and revenues. While Atlantic salmon, coho salmon, and rainbow trout from Chile and sockeye salmon from Alaska are not identical commodities, they compete in many of the same domestic and international markets, and Alaska's earnings in those markets have declined as Chile's production has increased. Although Alaska's average annual harvests have remained nearly constant, Alaska's production is now a small percentage of the total salmonid production in a world that eats significantly more salmonids than it did 25 years ago. Nevertheless, our model indicates that sockeye salmon prices continue to be sensitive to interannual variations in the quant...

AB  - A pesar de que Chile ha sido un pais pionero en estudios del efecto del impacto humano sobre la estructura comunitaria en ambientes marinos, y a pesar de la enorme importancia economica y social que el ambiente marino tiene para el pais, el desarrollo de programas de conservacion marina y de bases cientificas para la sustentabilidad no se han generado a la misma tasa a la que han explotado los recursos y se ha utilizado el ambiente costero para diversos fines. Aunque nosotros pensamos que el establecimiento de planes de conservacion a lo largo de la costa de Chile debe basarse en varios factores, los principios cientificos, biologicos y ecologicos deben guiar muchos de estos esfuerzos, y en este trabajo nosotros intentamos presentar una vision general del estado actual del conocimiento sobre la ecologia y la biogegrafia del sistema costero en Chile. En base a la informacion mas relevante existente, nuestros objetivos son: 1) identificar las caracteristicas biogeograficas y ecologicas del ecosistema costero y tambien vacios en informacion, 2) identificar las actividades humanas mas daninas que tengan impacto en la estructura y dinamica de estos sistemas, y 3) sugerir el uso de posibles indicadores para determinar la situacion de diferentes areas de la costa de Chile, y las necesidades de conservacion. Esta revision muestra, por un lado, areas geograficas con informacion critica deficitaria para planes futuros de manejo y conservacion marina , y por el otro lado, la disponibilidad de informacion de alta calidad para otras zonas geograficas del pais. Respecto de la informacion existente sobre taxonomia y patrones de distribucion de especies a gran escala, existen importantes vacios de informacion; no se esperan en el futuro grandes cambios en el numero total de especies. Existen pocos estudios sobre patrones de distribucion de especies a gran escala, y mas informacion es necesaria para identificar areas de alta diversidad de especies, especialmente para algunos taxa, como tambien para identificar areas que posean caracteristicas unicas en relacion a especies (endemicas, especies claves) y a procesos ecosistemicos (disturbios, surgencias). Para la mayoria de los invertebrados y macroalgas, las areas de alta diversidad de especies se encuentran en el sur de Chile. Nuevos estudios dirigidos a entender los factores que podrian generar patrones a macroescala son necesarios, como tambien informacion sobre oceanografia costera y disponibilidad de larvas. Esta informacion es clave para el diseno de una futura red de parques marinos. Por otro lado, la informacion disponible sobre estructuras comunitarias y funcionamiento ecosistemico, especialmente sobre el efecto del impacto humano, provienen de pocas regiones geograficas. Mas informacion sobre otras zonas geograficas es requerida, particularmente si se consideran las diferencias notables en temperatura, patrones de circulacion, heterogeneidad del habitat, y composicion de especies, como tambien el efecto de surgencia y de El Nino a lo largo de los mas de 4.000 km de costa de Chile. Finalmente, listamos las que consideramos son las actividades humanas mas daninas para el ambiente marino, e integramos esta informacion para sugerir posibles indicadores ambientales y necesidades basicas y sugerencias para conservacion marina in Chile

AB  - Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB), are natural phenomena that are produced by the proliferation of phytoplankton potentially harmful to humans and for some ecosystem services ( e.g ., good water quality for use in aquaculture, availability of natural resources). In Chile, HAB events of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and Alexandrium catenella are particularly relevant due to their potential toxicity. Although there are studies of the negative impact of these events, both the prediction of the occurrence of these phenomena and the associated risks are limited in the country. The proliferations have been attributed to the action of various oceanographic forcings ( e.g ., vertical stratification, irradiation, availability of nutrients). A research has been made about the factors and processes that have been associated with the appearance, permanence and toxicity of HAB and about the methodological efforts made to study and generate HAB forecasts in other countries. Based on a compilation of the information of occurrences and localities affected by these events, the seasonal, interannual and spatial variability of the events or occurrences of HAB in Chile was constructed. Subsequently, the current monitoring system is described, as well as future prediction efforts. Finally, the configuration of a monitoring system with observations and integrated prediction for the occurrence of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and Alexandrium catenella is suggested.

AB  - La presencia del dinoflagelado toxico Alexandrium catenella en las aguas interiores de la Patagonia noroccidental, fue registrada en la decada de los 90. A partir de 1995 se iniciaron programas de monitoreo de fitoplancton orientados al seguimiento de este dinoflagelado y sus efectos sobre los mariscos en la Decima y Undecima Region de Chile, financiados por distintas instituciones. Esto permitio recolectar una importante base de datos, aunque incompleta en muchos aspectos debido a la independencia de objetivos de los diferentes estudios. En esta revision se agruparon todos los datos disponibles para buscar patrones que ayuden a la formulacion de hipotesis sobre la dispersion e incidencia espacial y temporal de A. catenella en esta amplia zona y mucho mas habitada que la Duodecima Region. Inicialmente se recolectaron muestras mensuales y desde fines de 2000 semanales tanto de fitoplancton como de mariscos en un numero de estaciones que vario cada ano. Desde fines de 1995 al 2002 se registraron cuatro floraciones de A. catenella, con intensidad y distribucion variable, observandose una expansion de la distribucion geografica de esta especie hacia el norte (desde aproximadamente 45° 47' S en 1996 a 42° S, Chiloe en 2002). Las cuatro floraciones registradas fueron marcadamente estacionales, concentradas entre los meses de enero a marzo y coincidieron con los maximos registros del veneno paralizante de los mariscos. Los datos analizados sugieren que el origen de las floraciones de A. catenella en las aguas interiores de la region estaria asociada a la presencia de bancos de quistes, cuyo ciclo de vida se expresa con una variacion bianual debido a la variacion en condiciones ambientales que favorecen la germinacion de estos organismos. La influencia de oscilaciones en el oceano adyacente que estarian afectando las caracteristicas de circulacion general de las aguas interiores y las caracteristicas de la columna de agua (e.g., temperatura), favorecerian o inhibirian el inicio de floraciones de A. catenella. El aumento de la distribucion espacial de las floraciones de esta especie parece estar fuertemente influenciada por la deriva de aguas superficiales, originada principalmente por vientos y por las caracteristicas de circulacion de las aguas interiores.

AB  - Integrated fish farming combines livestock production with fish farming. Animal manure is shed directly into a fish pond as fertilizer and supports the growth of photosynthetic organisms. The livestock, mainly chickens and pigs, is often fed feed containing growth promoters. In this study we investigated the impact of integrated fish farming on the levels of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in a pond environment. One integrated broiler chicken-fish farm was studied for 2 months immediately after the start of a new fish production cycle. A significant increase over time in the resistance to six different antimicrobials was found for the indicator organism Acinetobacter spp. isolated from composite water-sediment samples. The initial resistance levels prior to the new production cycle were 1 to 5%. After 2 months the levels of resistance to oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole reached 100%, and the levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin were more than 80%. The long-term effects of resistance on integrated farming were studied on seven additional farms. The resistance levels were particularly high among Enterococcus spp. and were also high among Acinetobacter spp. isolated from water-sediment samples compared to the resistance levels at four control farms. In conclusion, integrated fish farming seems to favor antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the pond environment. This could be attributed to the selective pressure of antimicrobials in the pond environment and/or to the introduction of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from animal manure. Potential risks to human health were not addressed in this study and remain to be elucidated.

AB  - The farming of salmon and other marine finfish in open net pens continues to increase along the world's coastlines as the aquaculture industry expands to meet human demand. Farm fish are known to escape from pens in all salmon aquaculture areas. Their escape into the wild can result in interbreeding and competition with wild salmon and can facilitate the spread of pathogens, thereby placing more pressure on already dwindling wild populations. Here we assess the ecological, genetic, and socioeconomic impacts of farm salmon escapes, using a risk-assessment framework. We show that risks of damage to wild salmon populations, ecosystems, and society are large when salmon are farmed in their native range, when large numbers of salmon are farmed relative to the size of wild populations, and when exotic pathogens are introduced. We then evaluate the policy and management options for reducing risks and discuss the implications for farming other types of marine finfish.

AB  - The literature on productivity growth in the grow-out phase for salmon is substantial, yet little attention has been given to productivity growth of the input factors. This is despite the fact that a number of innovations have improved quality and reduced prices for many input factors that contribute to the competitiveness of the industry. This article provides an analysis of productivity growth for one key input factor in salmon farming, juvenile salmon. We estimate translog cost functions on salmon hatcheries for the period 1988 to 2010. The econometric analysis shows that innovations and productivity growth have led to a reduction of unit costs in production of salmon juveniles, particularly at earlier stages, but the rate of technical progress has declined in recent years.

AB  - There is interest in certification of aquaculture production facilities in response to concerns about negative environmental and social impacts and food safety. This study identifies issues to be considered by stakeholders in developing certification standards for channel catfish, tilapias, rainbow trout, oysters, mussels, clams, scallops, abalone, and seaweed. Common issues include land and water use, water pollution, benthic effects, effects on biodiversity, use of antibiotics and other chemicals, and relationships with workers and local communities. Specific, contentious issues apply to individual species or species groups. Fish meal use in feeds will be a major concern in finfish certification. Use of groundwater, removal of daily mortalities, and medicated feed in channel catfish culture should be given particular attention. Tilapia culture can introduce these species into watersheds where they have not previously occurred, resulting in serious competition with native species. Some environmentalists ...

AB  - Pseudo-nitzschia seriata (Cleve) H. Peragallo isolated from Scottish west coast waters was studied in batch culture with phosphate (P) or silicate (Si) as the yield-limiting nutrient at 15° C. This species produced the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) when either nutrient was limiting but produced more when stressed by Si limitation during the stationary phase. Under P-limiting conditions, exponential growth stopped after P was reduced to a low threshold concentration. Under Si-limiting conditions, fast exponential growth was followed by a period of slower exponential growth, until Si became exhausted. A stationary phase was observed in the P-limited but not the Si-limited cultures, the latter showing a rapid decrease in cell density after the second exponential growth phase. Si-limited cultures exhibited a further period of active metabolism (as indicated by increases in chl and carbon per cell) late in the experiment, presumably fueled by regenerated Si. DA production was low in exponential phase under both conditions. In P-limited cultures, most DA was produced during the immediate postexponential phase, with little or no new DA produced during later cell senescence. In contrast, although a substantial amount of DA was produced during the slower exponential phase of the Si-limited cultures, DA production was even greater near the end of the experiment, coincident with the period of chl synthesis and increase in carbon biomass. Comparison of the magnitude of toxin production in the two nutrient regimes indicated a greater threat of P. seriata-generated amnesic shellfish poisoning events under Si rather than P nutrient limitation.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is an economically and culturally important species. Norway has more than 400 watercourses with Atlantic salmon and supports a large proportion of the world’s wild Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon are structured into numerous genetically differentiated populations, and are therefore managed at the population level. Long-distance migrations between freshwater and ocean habitats expose Atlantic salmon to multiple threats, and a number of anthropogenic factors have contributed to the decline of Atlantic salmon during the last decades. Knowledge on the relative importance of the different anthropogenic factors is vital for prioritizing management measures. We developed a semi-quantitative 2D classification system to rank the different anthropogenic factors and used this to assess the major threats to Norwegian Atlantic salmon. Escaped farmed salmon and salmon lice from fish farms were identified as expanding population threats, with escaped farmed salmon being the largest current threat. These two factors affect populations to the extent that they may be critically endangered or lost, with a large likelihood of causing further reductions and losses in the future. The introduced parasite Gyrodactylus salaris, freshwater acidification, hydropower regulation and other habitat alterations were identified as stabilized population threats, which have contributed to populations becoming critically endangered or lost, but with a low likelihood of causing further loss. Other impacts were identified as less influential, either as stabilized or expanding factors that cause loss in terms of number of returning adults, but not to the extent that populations become threatened. Management based on population specific reference points (conservation limits) has reduced exploitation in Norway, and overexploitation was therefore no longer regarded an important impact factor. The classification system may be used as a template for ranking of anthropogenic impact factors in other countries and as a support for national and international conservation efforts.</jats:p>

AB  - The output from world aquaculture, a multi-billion dollar global industry, continues to rise at a very rapid rate and it is now acknowledged that it will take over from fisheries to become the main source of animal and plant products from aquatic environments in the future. Since the first edition of this excellent and successful book was published, the aquaculture industry has continued to expand at a massive rate globally and has seen huge advances across its many and diverse facets.

This new edition of Aquaculture: Farming Aquatic Animals and Plants covers all major aspects of the culture of fish, shellfish and algae in freshwater and marine environments. Subject areas covered include principles, water quality, environmental impacts of aquaculture, desert aquaculture, reproduction, life cycles and growth, genetics and stock improvement, nutrition and feed production, diseases, vaccination, post-harvest technology, economics and marketing, and future developments of aquaculture. Separate chapters also cover the culture of algae, carps, salmonids, tilapias, channel catfish, marine and brackish fishes, soft-shelled turtles, marine shrimp, mitten crabs and other decapod crustaceans, bivalves, gastropods, and ornamentals. There is greater coverage of aquaculture in China in this new edition, reflecting China's importance in the world scene.

For many, Aquaculture: Farming Aquatic Animals and Plants is now the book of choice, as a recommended text for students and as a concise reference for those working or entering into the industry. Providing core scientific and commercially useful information, and written by around 30 internationally-known and respected authors, this expanded and fully updated new edition of Aquaculture is a book that is essential reading for all students and professionals studying and working in aquaculture. Fish farmers, hatchery managers and all those supplying the aquaculture industry, including personnel within equipment and feed manufacturing companies, will find a great deal of commercially useful information within this important and now established book.

AB  - A new method for assigning individuals of unknown origin to populations, based on the genetic distance between individuals and populations, was compared to two existing methods based on the likelihood of multilocus genotypes. The distribution of the assignment criterion (genetic distance or genotype likelihood) for individuals of a given population was used to define the probability that an individual belongs to the population. Using this definition, it becomes possible to exclude a population as the origin of an individual, a useful extension of the currently available assignment methods. Using simulated data based on the coalescent process, the different methods were evaluated, varying the time of divergence of populations, the mutation model, the sample size, and the number of loci. Likelihood-based methods (especially the Bayesian method) always performed better than distance methods. Other things being equal, genetic markers were always more efficient when evolving under the infinite allele model than under the stepwise mutation model, even for equal values of the differentiation parameter F(st). Using the Bayesian method, a 100% correct assignment rate can be achieved by scoring ca. 10 microsatellite loci (H approximately 0.6) on 30-50 individuals from each of 10 populations when the F(st) is near 0.1.

AB  - Abstract The Chilean salmon farming industry is currently facing unprecedented economic losses related to the infectious salmon anemia (ISA) disease. Production of Atlantic salmon is being reduced from almost 400,000 tonnes in 2005 to an estimated 100,000 tonnes in 2010. The spread of and response to the disease raises a number of important issues with respect to the actions of the companies involved as well as the regulatory body. It is particularly interesting that adequate measures have not been implemented in Chile, as the species is farmed in relatively few countries and, as such, is fairly transparent. Moreover, all other major salmon- producing countries have experienced the disease, and several of the largest companies in Chile are multinationals with first-hand experience with ISA from other countries.

AB  - Using a Ricker (1975) model and escapement data for a subset of Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia watersheds, Krkosek et al. (2007a) predicted that sea lice infections originating on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms will cause the extinction of pink salmon(Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in the archipelago by 2010. The purpose of this article is to examine this issue in the context of all of the escapement data available for the archipelago and to review additional scientific reports and information not discussed by Krkosek et al. (2007a). Additional research during the last five years is not consistent with the Krkosek et al. (2007a) conclusion that sea lice routinely cause in excess of 80% mortality of fry. Rather, the literature reviewed herein indicates that pink salmon fry mount an effective immune response at sizes as small as 0.7 g, resulting in the rapid shedding of lice within two weeks. Pink salmon returns are shown to be highly variable throughout the Northeast Pacific in areas without salmon ...

AB  - The by-catch of sharks in artisanal demersal pink cusk-eel (Genypterus blacodes) and yellownose skate (Dipturus chilensis) fisheries is frequent within their fishing effort. Nevertheless, there is no registry of landings, which could help to control this problem. This is particularly evident for endemic species, which includes most coastal and deep water Chilean sharks. The main systematic characteristic of these Chondrichthyan species is the external morphology of the neurocraneum. The form and arrangement of the teeth and dermal denticles allow specific differences to be identified. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the biology and systematic knowledge of demersal shark species, teeth and dermal denticle morphology and neurocraneum morphometrics of two species of Scyliorhinids, the redspotted catshark (Schroederichthys chilensis) and the dusky catshark (Halaelurus canescens), as well as three Squaliforms, the granular dogfish (Centroscyllium granulatum), the birdbeak dogfish (Deania calcea) and the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias).

AB  - A partir de los procesos recientes de reestructuracion regional y desarrollo de la provincia de Chiloe, Chile, las comunidades tradicionales se ven enfrentadas a la “glocalizacion” de su base economica y de sus aspectos socioculturales. Se senala el punto de vista de las municipalidades en relacion a los impactos generados por la industria salmonera y a las facultades con que cuenta el nivel local para manejarlos. Se demuestra que la salmonicultura en Chiloe no parece conducir a un ejemplo exitoso de reestructuracion espacial, desarrollandose un sistema de innovacion global, sin que los actores locales esten integrados e influyan sobre las decisiones tomadas en los territorios sobre los cuales ejercen un rol y responsabilidad democratica. Se ve claramente la existencia de una doble jerarquia entre responsabilidades politico-administrativas locales y el aparato publico-privado para fomentar el desarrollo economico local, lo que debilita las estructuras locales democraticas en la busqueda del crecimiento economico nacional.

AB  - Eco-certifications have become an important site of power struggles in commodity sectors such as forestry, fisheries, aquaculture, palm oil, and soy. In each, multiple eco-certification initiatives have been developed and resisted through interactions among non-governmental organizations, governments, and commercial actors. This paper contributes to understanding how power is embodied in certifications by exploring how territoriality manifests in the international struggle over defining what products are ‘sustainable’ and which producers will have access to markets that require ‘sustainable’ products. Focusing on the wild capture fisheries sector in which the non-governmental Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) administers the preeminent eco-certification initiative, we explore the emergence of new fisheries eco-certification initiatives in Japan, Iceland, Alaska, Canada, and the US that insist there is no transnational monopoly on judgments over fisheries sustainability. We argue that these new eco-certifications attempt to defend and embed territorial social and regulatory relations of production within the contested domain of transnational sustainability governance. The initiatives accommodate both the territorially embedded material interests, institutions, and discursive strategies of producers (and their state supporting agencies) and transnationally embedded governance norms for assessing and communicating sustainability. They also counter the globally applicable institutions of the MSC in favor of making space for state and non-state actors to contend with demands for sustainability in the global seafood market by combining place-specific attributes with transnational governance norms.

AB  - Several studies indicate an integrated global market for salmon. However, there is increasing evidence of market segmentation for various seafood species. A disease crisis in Chile that reduced production by two-thirds provides a strong market shock that can shed light on how strongly integrated the salmon market is. Our results indicate that Chilean producers changed the product mix and export markets as a result of the disease shock. Yet, the relative prices remained constant, indicating a high degree of market integration. Moreover, Chilean prices are endogenous to the Norwegian price, indicating that prices are determined at the global market.

AB  - Prenant en compte le contexte international des productions halieutiques, cet article propose des orientations de recherche dans le domaine de la pisciculture. Il s’agit principalement de recherches sur la maitrise de la qualite des milieux aquacoles, en particulier de milieux littoraux et des eaux continentales, qui integrent la question des impacts negatifs de certaines formes d’aquaculture en vue de contribuer a preserver a la fois la qualite des produits et le potentiel de production aquacole a long terme. Des recherches pluridisciplinaires sur l’alimentation et la lutte contre les bioagresseurs, prenant en compte les specificites des systemes aquacoles, en particulier celles des systemes extensifs, sont egalement proposees. Accompagner les initiatives visant a definir et mettre en œuvre des systemes aquacoles repondant, aux yeux des citoyens-consommateurs, aux divers criteres de la durabilite et preservant l’image favorable des produits aquatiques est egalement un enjeu important. Nous insistons enfin sur deux aspects lies aux relations entre les populations naturelles et les populations aquacoles et qui posent des questions de recherche originales : celui de la domestication des especes et, a l’inverse, celui des divers impacts des individus echappes d’elevage ou deliberement relâches.

AB  - Farmed salmon strains have been selected to improve growth rates as well as other traits of commercial interest but the 2 million farmed salmon escaping annually may enhance the risk of extinction of wild populations through genetic and ecological interactions. Here, we compare the transcription profiles of 3557 genes in the progeny of farmed and wild Atlantic salmon from Norway and Canada grown in controlled conditions, and demonstrate that five to seven generations of artificial selection led to heritable changes in gene transcription profiles, the average magnitude of the differences being 25% and 18% for at least 1.4% and 1.7% of the expressed genes in juvenile salmon from Norway and Canada, respectively. Moreover, genes showing significant transcription profile differences in both farmed strains (16%) all exhibited parallel changes. These findings, along with the identification of several genes whose expression profiles were modified through artificial selection, provide new insights into the molecular basis of parallel evolution, and suggest how gene flow from farmed escapees may affect the genetic integrity of wild populations.

AB  - Analysis of six microsatellite loci in 5800 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from 29 Fraser River pop- ulations provided little evidence of genetic bottlenecks or mass straying in upper Fraser sockeye salmon resulting from reduced abundances following 1913-1914 rockslides in the Fraser canyon and successive decades of high exploitation. Upper Fraser populations were not characterized by a paucity of rare alleles, a sensitive indicator of populations in which effective size has been recently reduced. Heterozygosity and allelic diversity did not differ consistently between lower and upper Fraser populations. Throughout the watershed, early-migrating populations had lower allelic diversity and a lower proportion of rare alleles than did late-migrating ones. Genetic differentiation between upper and lower Fraser populations and heterogeneity among lower Fraser populations supported the suggestion that Fraser sockeye salmon are descendants of at least two postglacial "races." Variation among lakes within regions was the strongest component of genetic structure, accounting for five times the variation among populations within lakes and more than two times the variation among regions. Extensive historical transplants of eggs and juveniles apparently resulted in lit- tle gene flow among regions, but three populations were reestablished or rebuilt as the result of more recent transplants. Resume : L'analyse des locus microsatellites chez 5800 saumons rouges (Oncorhynchus nerka) provenant de 29 popu- lations du Fraser a donne peu d'indications de l'existence de goulots d'etranglement genetiques ou de vagabondage en masse parmi les saumons rouges du cours superieur du Fraser a la suite des reductions de l'abondance causees par les eboulements survenus dans le canyon du Fraser en 1913-1914, puis par des decennies successives de forte exploitation. Les populations du cours superieur du Fraser ne se caracterisaient pas par un appauvrissement en alleles rares, ce qui constitue un indicateur sensible des populations chez lesquelles l'effectif a ete reduit depuis peu. L'heterozygotie et la diversite allelique ne differaient pas de facon constante entre les populations du cours superieur et du cours inferieur du Fraser. Partout dans le bassin, les populations a migration hâtive presentaient une diversite allelique et une propor - tion des alleles rares plus faibles que les populations a migration tardive. La differenciation genetique des populations du cours superieur et du cours inferieur du Fraser et l'heterogeneite des populations du cours inferieur du fleuve peu - vent confirmer que les saumons rouges du Fraser sont les descendants d'au moins deux « races » post-glaciaires. La variation entre les lacs au sein des regions etait la composante la plus forte de la structure genetique, et elle represen - tait cinq fois la variation parmi les populations au sein des lacs, et plus de deux fois la variation entre les regions. Les importantes transplantations d'oeufs et de juveniles effectuees dans le passe semblent avoir produit peu de flux genique entre les regions, mais trois populations ont ete retablies ou reconstituees par suite de transplantations plus recentes.

AB  - The paper demonstrates four general mecha- nisms that may affect economically valuable species when ex- posed to biological invasion. We distinguish between an ecolog- ical level effect and an ecological growth effect .I n addition, we present an economic quantity effect working through demand. Finally, we suggest that there is an economic quality effect that reflects the possibility that invasions affect the harvest- ing agents directly through demand-side forces. For example, this may occur because the state of the original species or the ecosystem is altered. We depart from the existing litera- ture by revealing ecological and economic forces that explain why different agents may lack incentives to control invasions. The theoretical model is illustrated by the case where escaped farmed salmon (EFS ) influence wild Atlantic salmon fisheries.

AB  - Globally, besides human medicine, an increasing amount of antibiotics as veterinary drugs and feed additives are used annually in many countries with the rapid development of the breeding industry (livestock breeding and aquaculture). As a result, mostly ingested antibiotic doses (30–90%) and their metabolites to humans and animals, as emerging persistent contaminants, were excreted together with urine and feces, and subsequently disseminated into environmental compartments in forms of urban wastewater, biosolids, and manures. More importantly, significant amount of antibiotics and their bioactive metabolites or degradation products were introduced in agro-ecosystems through fertilization and irrigation with antibiotics-polluted manures, biosolids, sewage sludge, sediments, and water. Subsequently, accumulation and transport of antibiotics in soil–crop systems, particularly soil–vegetable systems, e.g., protected vegetable and organic vegetable production systems, poses great risks on crops, soil ecosystem, and quality of groundwater- and plant-based products. The aim of this review is to explore the sources, fates (degradation, adsorption, runoff, leaching, and crop uptake), and ecological risks of antibiotics in agro-ecosystems and possible food security and public health impacts. Three topics were discussed: (1) the occurrence, fates, and ecological impacts of antibiotics in agro-ecosystems, a global agro-ecological issue; (2) the potential ecological risks and public health threat of antibiotic pollution in soil–vegetable system, especially protected vegetable and organic vegetable production systems; and (3) the strategies of reducing the introduction, accumulation, and ecological risks of antibiotics in agro-ecosystems. To summarize, environmental contamination of antibiotics has become increasingly serious worldwide, which poses great risks in agro-ecosystems. Notably, protected vegetable and organic vegetable production systems, as public health closely related agro-ecosystems, are susceptible to antibiotic contamination. Occurrence, fate, and ecotoxicity of antibiotics in agro-ecosystems, therefore, have become most urgent issues among antibiotic environmental problems. Nowadays, source control, including reducing use and lowering environmental release through pretreatments of urban wastes and manures is a feasible way to alleviate negative impacts of antibiotics in agro-ecosystems.

AB  - Abstract Commercial salmon and trout farming has emerged as a major industry in Chile during the last two decades. Salmon is not a native species to Chile; however, excellent climatic conditions are provided for farming activities in the southern part of the country. After negligible production volumes during the early years, the harvest levels accelerated in the late 1980s, and since 1992 Chile has been the second largest producer of farmed salmon and trout in the world after Norway. This report reviews the development of the Chilean salmonid industry from its early stages until today with respect to production patterns, legislation and main markets. A cost comparison between Chilean and Norwegian farmed salmon is also provided. Finally, the international competitiveness and future challenges of the Chilean salmonid farming industry are analysed.

AB  - The prevalence of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in the River Ewe, western Scotland, was assessed. After the establishment of smolt cages in the catchment and marine cages near the river mouth during 1986–1987, approximately 425 000 parr and smolts, and 122 000 growers have escaped. Between 1987 and 2001, farmed salmon occurred in the rod fishery in 13 of the 15 years, contributing at least 5.8% of the total catch, with a maximum annual frequency of 27.1%. It was estimated that <1% of fish escaping from the marine cages entered the river, but contributed at least 27% of potential anadromous spawners in 1997. Radiotagged, farmed fish in 2001 probably spawned in three subcatchments also used by tagged wild fish. Despite the likelihood of hybridisation there was no change in the median weight or marine age of wild fish, but smolt age decreased significantly (P < 0.02). The Ewe has a depleted wild salmon population (≤900 anadromous adults), and further genetic introgression by escapees should be prevented.

AB  - Hindar, K., Fleming, I. A., McGinnity, P., and Diserud, O. 2006. Genetic and ecological effects of salmon farming on wild salmon: modelling from experimental results. � ICES Journal of Marine Science, 63: 1234e1247. Cultured salmonids are released or escape into the wild in large numbers and may make up significant proportions of wild salmonid populations in fresh- and saltwater, causing considerable concern for the fitness and productivity of these populations. This paper focuses on the effects of escaped farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) on wild salmon. Farmed salmon have been under artificial selection for growth and other economically important traits for 30 years and are genetically different in their origin at the molecular and quantitative genetic levels. Escaped farmed salmon spawn in the wild with limited success. Their offspring outgrow those of wild origin but suffer higher mortality. Whole-river experiments in Ireland and Norway have shown that the lifetime success of farmed salmon is reduced relative to wild salmon. Based on data from these experiments, we model the future of wild salmon populations experiencing invasions of escaped farmed salmon. Simulations with a fixed intrusion rate of 20% escaped farmed salmon at spawning suggest that substantial changes take place in wild salmon populations within ten salmon generations (w40 years). Low-invasion scenarios suggest that farmed offspring are unlikely to become established in the population, whereas high-invasion scenarios suggest that populations are eventually mixtures of hybrid and farmed descendants. Recovery of the wild population is not likely under all circumstances, even after many decades without further intrusion. Managers of wild salmon will have difficulty in obtaining broodstock of the original wild population after a few generations of high intrusion. We conclude that further measures to reduce escapes of farmed salmon and their spawning in wild populations are urgently needed.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines recent advances in production economics with special reference to efficiency measurement using production frontiers and its implications for aquaculture management. Compared with agriculture and other industries, the use of production frontiers in aquaculture is still very limited. However, in recent years several frontier applications in aquaculture have appeared in the literature, suggesting potential applications of these techniques in aquaculture. A synopsis of stochastic frontier production function model and data envelopment analysis (DEA), the two most popular approaches to efficiency measurement, is presented, followed by a review of recent frontier studies in shrimp, carp and tilapia production. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future development and prospects of frontier applications for aquaculture management.

AB  - This paper discusses the relationship between industry growth and environmental quality in the context of salmon aquaculture. It is argued that industry growth can reduce pollution by inducing more technological innovations for industry-specific, pollution-reducing inputs. This increases the elasticity of substitution between conventional factors of production on the one hand, and pollution on the other, and therefore enables a greater degree of internalization of environmental problems. Four indicators of pollution are examined for Norwegian salmon aquaculture. The salmon aquaculture industry is one in which growth is associated with reduced environmental problems not only in relative, but also in absolute terms.

AB  - Research has recognized that states enable or constrain private governance initiatives, but we still know too little about the interactions between private and public authority in the governance of various social and environmental problems. This article examines how states have responded to the emergence of forest and fisheries certification programs, and how state responses have influenced the subsequent development of these programs. It is argued that historical and structural differences in the management of forest and fisheries have resulted in divergent state responses to certification programs, but that both trajectories of interaction have led to a strengthening of the non-state program. The article draws upon these cases to inductively identify types of interaction between state policies and non-state certification programs, the causal mechanisms that shed light on interaction dynamics, and the conditions under which state involvement is likely to result in either strengthening or weakening of non-state programs.

AB  - Seafood sector can contribute to the global food supply in an important way, and provide an important source of animal protein. Based on observed regional trends in seafood production and consumption and using a global, partial-equilibrium, multi-market model, this study investigates what the global seafood market may look like in 2030. The model projects that the total fish supply will increase from 154 million tons in 2011 to 186 million tons in 2030, with aquaculture entirely responsible for the increase. The fastest aquaculture growth is expected for tilapia and shrimp, while the largest expansion is expected in India, Latin America and Caribbean and Southeast Asia. Fast-growing seafood demand in China and elsewhere represents a critical opportunity for global fisheries and aquaculture to improve their management and achieve sustainable seafood economy.

AB  - There was a synchronous and significant decrease in marine survival of coho salmon in the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and off the coast from California to Washington after 1989. This large-scale, synchronous change indicates that trends in coho marine survivals were linked over the southern area of their distribution in the north-east Pacific, and that these linkages were associated with a common event. Indicators of large-scale climate change (the Aleutian Low Pressure Index) and of recent regional climate change (the April flows from the Fraser River) also changed abruptly about the same time. The synchrony of trends in marine survival of aggregates of coho stocks from three distinct marine areas and trends in climate indices implies that climate/ocean changes can have profound impacts on the population dynamics of coho salmon. The trend towards low marine survival may persist as long as the trends in the climate indicators do not change.

AB  - In the Baltic Sea area, including the Kattegat, the external N/P loadingratios are generally well above the 16:1 Redfield ratio for all subareas (theBothnian Bay, the Bothnian Sea, the Baltic proper and the Kattegat).During winter, the inorganic N/P ratio in surface waters varies. Appreciablyhigher values than the loading ratio are found for the northernmostbasin, the low-saline Bothnian Bay, while lower values than the loadingratio are found for the Baltic proper and the Kattegat. Nutrient enrichmenttests indicate general N limitation in the Baltic proper and the Kattegat,although stimulation of algal growth after P enrichment has been found inthe Baltic proper during summer blooms of blue-green algae. Blooms ofblue-green algae are common in the Baltic proper but hardly ever occur inthe Bothnian Bay and the Kattegat. This has been the case for the lastcentury, indicating natural summer N limitation. Full-scale experimentalmanipulation of the external N/P loading ratio has been carried out in theHimmerfjard basin, south of Stockholm. Results suggest nitrogen as themost limiting nutrient in coastal areas of the Baltic proper, uninfluencedby direct nutrient discharges. The knowledge of the effects of alteredexternal nutrient supplies for nutrient limitation in the Baltic Sea systemas a whole is too limited to allow for reliable predictions. However, theBaltic Sea may have developed towards a more pronounced N limitationdue to a twofold historic increase in P supply relative to N supply. Atpresent, the situation may be reversed as N supply is probably increasingmore rapidly than P supply. Management of the Baltic Sea area cannot bebased on removal of either N or P in sewage, but must take both elementsinto consideration, as well as differences between sub-basins andbetween polluted coastal and offshore areas.

AB  - The escape of fish from aquaculture is perceived as a threat to wild fish populations. The escapes problem is largely caused by technical and operational failures of fish farming equipment. In Norway, 3.93 million Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, 0.98 million rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and 1.05 million Atlantic cod Gadus morhua escaped from 2001 to 2009. Salmonids primarily escape after structural failures of containment equipment, while a far greater percentage of cod than salmon escape through holes in the nets. Correlative evidence suggests that after the Norwegian technical standard (NS 9415) for sea-cage farms took effect in 2004, the total number of escaped Atlantic salmon declined from >600 000 (2001 to 2006) to <200 000 fish yr -1 (2007 to 2009), despite the total number of salmon held in sea-cages increasing by 44% during this period. No similar decrease in escaped cod has occurred, suggesting that other measures, such as improved netting materials for sea-cages, are required. In addition to escaping as juveniles or adults, cod may reproduce in sea- cages, and thus fertilised eggs escape to the environment. The ecological effects of 'escape through spawning' are unclear, and methods to inhibit escape by this mechanism are being explored. To pre- vent escapes of juvenile and adult fish as sea-cage aquaculture industries develop, we recommend that policy-makers implement a 5 component strategy: (1) establish mandatory reporting of all escape incidents; (2) establish a mechanism to analyse and learn from the mandatory reporting; (3) conduct mandatory, rapid, technical assessments to determine the causes of escape incidents involving more than 10 000 fish; (4) introduce a technical standard for sea-cage aquaculture equipment coupled with an independent mechanism to enforce the standard; and (5) conduct mandatory training of fish farm staff in escape-critical operations and techniques.

AB  - The price of farmed Atlantic salmon from Norway has increased in recent years. This new regime follows several years of consistently falling prices. At the same time price volatility has increased substantially. This article models the volatility of salmon prices and establishes empirically that volatility is on an increasing trend. Further empirical analysis suggests that the volatility trend is largely accounted for by the common trend in other food prices relevant to salmon, including meats, cereals, oils and fish meal observed in recent years. Other potentially contributing factors to volatility are also discussed. This includes the role of the 2005 maximum total allowable biomass restriction, the 2006 introduction of the Fish Pool ASA futures market for salmon, the Chilean Salmon crisis and the increasing use of bilateral contracts.

AB  - Abstract. Little is known about migration of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) in the Pacific Ocean. We used satellite telemetry to determine the post-breeding movement patterns of recently molted male Magellanic Penguins (n = 6) at Punihuil, southern Chile, in 2006. Five individuals went north, stopping at two separate wintering areas along the coast, while one went 300 km south to waters inland of the island of Chiloe, Chile. The most commonly used wintering area (n = 3) was 600–800 km north of the breeding colony, near the Gulf of Arauco, Chile, where high levels of primary productivity are common. Magellanic Penguin wintering areas coincided with important areas for other seabirds and overlapped with human fisheries.

AB  - Abstract A survey of wild fishes captured around marine net-pen salmon farms and from open waters for certain salmonid pathogens was conducted in the coastal waters of British Columbia. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus was detected in Pacific herring Clupea pallasi, shiner perch Cymatogaster aggregata, and threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus. Infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) virus was detected in one Pacific herring (collected well away from the farms) and in tube-snouts Aulorhynchus flavidus and shiner perch collected from a farm experiencing an IHN outbreak. Renibacterium salmoninarum was observed in moribund Pacific hakes Merluccius productus collected from within a net-pen and was also detected in several ocean-caught salmon. Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (typical strain) was isolated from a juvenile chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, whereas the atypical strain of this organism was isolated from a lingcod Ophiodon elongatus.

AB  - The Fourth Edition of Genetics of Populations is the most current, comprehensive, and accessible introduction to the field for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, and researchers in genetics, evolution, conservation, and related fields. In the past several years, interest in the application of population genetics principles to new molecular data has increased greatly, and Dr. Hedrick's new edition exemplifies his commitment to keeping pace with this dynamic area of study. Reorganized to allow students to focus more sharply on key material, the Fourth Edition integrates coverage of theoretical issues with a clear presentation of experimental population genetics and empirical data. Drawing examples from both recent and classic studies, and using a variety of organisms to illustrate the vast developments of population genetics, this text provides students and researchers with the most comprehensive resource in the field.

AB  - Abstract Fish feed waste enhancement of the particulate food supply and performance of mussels Mytilus edulis suspended near salmon cages at an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) site was assessed using a multi-indicator approach. Dietary indicators included bulk measurements of seston quantity and nutritional quality, proximate analysis (PA), fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope (SI) composition. Mussel tissue indicators consisted of PA and FA composition. Mussel performance was assessed from physiological integrations (scope for growth, SFG), growth efficiency (K 2 ) and condition index (CI). All measurements were made over 2 days at a commercial IMTA farm and a monoculture mussel farm in the Bay of Fundy (Canada). Significant differences detected in seston quantity and quality were within the range of natural spatial variability. The SFG of IMTA mussels was lower (28.71 J h −1 ) than monoculture mussels (38.71 J h −1 ) and reflected site differences in natural food availability and composition that affected absorption rate. PA of mussel organs didn't reflect a significant fish feed contribution to the mussel diet. However, dietary enhancement and assimilation of fish feed waste was demonstrated by significantly higher levels of feed FA biomarkers 20:1ω9, 18:2ω6, 18:1ω9 and low ω3/ω6 ratio in seston, mussel tissues and feces at the IMTA site than at the mussel farm. SI (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) in seston and mussel feces significantly differed among sites and IMTA mussels had significantly higher CI (21%) than monoculture individuals (16%). It was concluded that bulk indicators of the diet, short-term physiological integrations, and PA of mussel tissues have a limited capacity to detect dietary enhancement at IMTA sites. FA and SI tracers of fish feed waste were shown to be more sensitive for detecting the low-levels of diet enhancement within the large range of natural seston variation.

AB  - Wild Atlantic salmon are traditionally harvested from both the sea and spawning rivers during spawning runs. From an economic point of view, the return from sport fishing in rivers is several times higher than marine 'for meat only' harvests. This situation calls for a side payment regime where river owners pay marine fishermen not to fish, and where both parties gain. This paper argues that the reason why such side payment regimes are rarely seen, despite the obvious mutual gain, is due to the potential free riding incentives among river owners. Although it is shown that the decision each river owner faces can be described as a game of chicken, taking the stochastic ecology into account may reveal a different payoff structure. It is also demonstrated that the stochastic ecology of salmon, combined with price rigidities in the rivers, may explain the lack of side payment regimes.

AB  - Los salmonideos no son nativos del hemisferio sur, y es asi que las truchas (arcoiris y cafe) se establecieron en el sur de Sudamerica hace un siglo. La mayoria de los intentos por introducir salmones anadromos fallo hasta el establecimiento de la acuicultura en los anos ochenta. A partir de 1990, aparentemente debido a escapes de Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (salmon Chinook) de cultivo, se estan produciendo retornos reproductivos de esta especie en cuencas chilenas y argentinas al sur de los 39o S. En este trabajo se muestra la ocurrencia historica y espacial de salmon chinook en cuatro cuencas de vertiente Pacifica durante la ultima decada. Nuestro objetivo es establecer el progreso de su establecimiento al tiempo que se proyectan algunos impactos asi como alternativas de manejo. En Chile, el muestreo se realizo entre 1995 y 2005 incluyendo los rios Petrohue, Poicas, Rio Negro-Hornopiren, y el Lago Puyehue, en la X Region. En Argentina los rios muestreados incluyen al Futaleufu, Carrenleufu y Pico. En las cuencas chilenas y argentinas los Chinook reproductivos alcanzaban 73 a 130 cm de largo total encontrandose los mas pequenos en el Lago Puyehue donde la poblacion estaria encerrada. En el Rio Petrohue, los retornos variaron de ano en ano alcanzando maximos en 1996 y en el 2004 de hasta 500 kg de pescado en una extension de 100 m de rio. La distribucion temporal de juveniles sugiere que principalmente se trata del tipo chinook oceanico ya que migrarian al mar durante el primer ano de vida. Como se observa en Petrohue, poblaciones reproductivas de la especie aportarian cantidades relevantes de nutrientes de origen marino tal como ocurre en sus habitats naturales, produciendo asi una importante perturbacion a los balances y ciclos naturales en estos sitios. El establecimiento de poblaciones de Chinook en el sur de Sudamerica, genera nuevos desafios a pescadores y autoridades ya que se podria desarrollar una pesqueria de la especie en el oceano Pacifico con consecuencias sobre otros recursos pesqueros. Adicionalmente tambien se transforman en un recuso para la pesca deportiva. Por ello se hace necesario desarrollar herramientas de manejo y control sobre la poblacion para evitar perturbaciones ecologicas y ecosistemicas irreversibles

AB  - Humankind has adopted an arrogant and ultimately self-defeating attitude toward nature that places technological mastery over nature at the forefront of our approach to many environmental problems. This “techno-arrogance” fails to recognize limitations on, and ramifications of, attempted control of nature. An example of techno-arrogance is the flawed attempt to recover Pacific salmonid fisheries through technological application in the form of hatcheries. Countless salmon stocks have declined precipitously over the last century as a result of overfishing and widespread habitat destruction. A central feature of recovery efforts has been to build many hatcheries to produce large quantities of fish to restock streams. This approach addresses the symptoms but not the causes of the declines (an example of a halfway technology), because the habitats remain largely unsuitable for salmon. There are at least six reasons why the hatchery approach will ultimately fail: (1) data demonstrate that hatcheries are not solving the problem—salmon continue to decline despite decades of hatchery production; (2) hatcheries are costly to run, and divert resources from other efforts, such as habitat restoration; (3) hatcheries are not sustainable in the long term, requiring continual input of money and energy, (4) hatcheries are a genetically unsound approach to management that can adversely affect wild populations; (5) hatchery production leads to increased harvest of declining wild populations of salmon; and (6) hatcheries conceal from the public the truth of real salmon decline. I recommend that salmonid management turn from the symptoms to the causes of decline. Overharvest and habitat destruction must be directly addressed in a major, landscape-level effort, on a scale comparable to the hatchery program, if salmonid fisheries are to remain a part of the ecological recreational, commercial and asthetic arenas in the long term.



La humanidad ha adoptado una actitud arrogante, y en ultima instancia destinada al fracaso, que pone a la maestria tecnologica por encima de la naturaleza en la vanguardia de nuestro ataque a muchos de los problemas ambientales. Esta arrogancia tecnologica falla en reconocer las limitaciones y las ramificaciones que tienen los intentos en controlar la naturaleza. Un ejemplo de arrogancia tecnologica es el intento fallido de recuperar las pesquerias salmoneras del Pacifico a traves de aplicaciones tecnologicas en forma de criaderos. Innumerables stocks de salmones han decrecido precipitadamente en la ultima centuria como resultado de la sobrepesca y la destruccion masiva de habitats. Una caracteristica central de los esfuerzos de recuperacion ha sido la construccion de numerosos criaderos a los efectos de producir grandes cantidades de peces para sembrar los rios. Esta estrategia esta dirigida a los sintomas pero no a las causas do la declinacion (un ejemplo de tecnologia a medio camino), puesto que los habitats permanecen en su mayoria-no aptos para el salmon. Existen por lo menos seis razones por las cuales la estrategia de criaderos esta, en ultima instancia, destinada al fracaso: (1) datos demuestran los criaderos no estan resolviendo el problema; el salmon continua declinando a pesar de decadas de produccion en los criaderos; (2) los criaderos son costosos en su operacion, y desvian recursos que podrian ser destinados a otros esfuerzos tales como la restauracion del habitat; (3) los criaderos no son sostenibles en el largo plazo, requiriendo un flujo continuo de dinero y energia; (4) los criaderos son una estrategia erronea desde un punto de vista genetico y pueden afectar adversamente a las poblaciones silvestres; (5) la produccion de los criaderos conlleva a un incremento en la cosecha de poblaciones silvestres de salmon; y (6) las estaciones de cria ocultan al publico las verdaderas causas de la declinacion de las poblaciones silvestres de salmon. Recomiendo que el manejo del salmon pase de los sintomas a las causas de la declinacion. La sobrepesca y la destruccion del habitat tienen que ser consideradas en un esfuerzo de grandes magnitudes a nivel paisajistico y a una escala comparable a la de las campanas de criaderos a los efectos de que las pesquerias de salmon continuen formando parte de las arenas ecologicas recreativas y comerciales en el largo plazo.

AB  - <jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold>Ecohistories of aquaculture suggest that aquaculture is a natural part of human development throughout history and that modern, industrial aquaculture could strengthen its social and ecological roots by articulating its evolution along a sustainability trajectory
 and by adopting fully the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) ecosystems approach to aquaculture (EAA; &lt;xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121"&gt;Soto et al., 2008&lt;/xref&gt;). The EAA creates a new code for global aquaculture development, combining into one common framework the two most
 important social‐ecological trajectories for global aquaculture—aquaculture for the world’s rich and aquaculture for the world’s poor. Knowledge of the rich archeology and anthropology of aquaculture connects this FAO code to antiquity, creating a single development
 pathway for aquaculture throughout human history. Without widespread adoption of an EAA, &lt;xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50"&gt;FAO (2009)&lt;/xref&gt; projections of aquaculture development over the next 30 years may provide a far too optimistic scenario for its global growth. In this regard,
 aquaculture over the last 20 years has been criticized as lacking adequate attention and investment in developing grassroots, democratic, extension processes to engage a broader group of stakeholders to evolve the “blue revolution.” As an example, there has been a failure of fisheries
 and aquaculture to plan together to ensure sustainable supplies of seafood—the world’s most valuable proteins for human health—for seafood-eating peoples. Nonfed aquaculture (seaweeds, shellfish) has received worldwide attention for its rapid movement toward greater sustainability,
 which has led to more widespread social acceptance. For fed aquaculture, recent trends analyses have suggested that aquaculture is turning from the ocean to land-based agriculture to provide its protein feeds and oils. As such, more sophisticated, ecologically planned and designed “aquaculture
 ecosystems” will become more widespread because they better fit the social‐ecological context of both rich and poor countries. Ecological aquaculture provides the basis for developing a new social contract for aquaculture that is inclusive of all stakeholders and decision makers
 in fisheries, agriculture, and ecosystems conservation and restoration.</jats:p>

Numerous examples of the relationships between fish abundance trends and the environment are included. Most investigations are from the North Pacific Ocean, but studies done in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Bering Sea, the Yellow Sea, and selected freshwater lakes are also included. The effect of climate change on cod, pollock, salmon, herring, Dungeness crab, Japanese sardine, and Californian anchovy (among others) is discussed.

AB  - This paper is aimed at underlining the limited knowledge available about the physiology of triploid fishes compared with diploids. Whereas many aspects (induction, detection, growth, resistance to diseases, etc.) in the production and rearing of triploid fishes have widely been developed and described in the literature, other numerous questions of ecophysiology remain in abeyance, and the study of triploid cells physiology is still in its infancy. Triploid fishes can be considered as models worthwhile for physiological investigations not only for the economical stake in relation to the development of triploid fishes rearing, but also for the cytological and molecular features of their tissues and organs. The functional implications of these features have been poorly studied although they are potential areas of applied and/or fundamental studies.

AB  - Chilean salmon farming has been considered as an outstanding example of success after growing at double digit rates for more than twenty years. While the expansion was indeed dramatic, it came at the expense of severe sanitary and environmental deterioration. The outbreak in 2008 of the infectious salmon anaemia, a viral disease that kills salmon, but does not affect humans, has made this utterly clear. The overexploitation of the ‘commons’ upon which the industry has grown and the lack of an adequate regulatory mechanism to monitor adverse environmental effects contributed to this disaster, which now threatens the future of the industry and the country benefting from its natural comparative advantage for salmon farming. The paper shows that activities based on the exploitation of a common pool resource require quite a different analytical approach than the one conventional neoclassical theory offers us for the understanding of frm and industry behaviour. This study shows that industries of this sort enjoy unique location-specifc conditions requiring specifc know how, R&D, and strong public-private cooperation in order to attain environmentally sustainable long term growth.

AB  - The production of appropriate genetically modified organisms (GMOs) offers considerable opportunities for more efficient and more effective aquaculture across a wide range of species. Although this potential is being realized in crop production with over 60 million hectares under cultivation, there has been no commercial use of GMOs in aquaculture. Here we review the nature of GMOs, the range of aquatic species in which GMOs have been produced, the methods and target genes employed, the benefits to aquaculture, the problems attached to the use of GMOs and the regulatory and other social frameworks surrounding them. We conclude with a set of recommendations aimed at best practice.

AB  - Aquaculture of salmon constitutes a rapidly growing worldwide industry with an expanding globalized market (1,2). Although this industry has several economic benefits, according to recent reports it is also accompanied by effects that are detrimental to human and animal health and the environment (1,2). Aquaculture has been implicated in the transmission of infectious diseases. For example, in caged fish aquaculture, bacterial and parasitic diseases can be transmitted to wild fish (1,2). Furthermore, aquaculture-raised fish may be susceptible to the microorganisms and parasites of wild fish (1,3). However, in spite of the accepted fact that parasitic worms can be transmitted to humans by free-ranging fish (4), until recently, few examples have been reported of pathogens that could be transmitted to humans directly by the products and subproducts of salmon aquaculture. I discuss here information indicating that salmon aquaculture is involved in expanding the range of fish tapeworm infections in nature and to humans.

AB  - Abstract Among various combinations attempted with six species of Salmonidae, eight crosses provided viable fry 15 days after hatching. Subsequent survival of these hybrids was studied up to the 4th month after hatching. Reasonably good success rates were exhibited by coho salmon ♀ × chinook salmon ♂ hybrids (50% of control) and, to a much lesser degree, by brown trout ♀ × brook trout ♂ and rainbow trout ♀ × coho salmon ♂ hybrids (20% of control). Body length was measured in the lots which could be raised to fingerling stage. No hybrid superiority in growth was evidenced, with the exception of brown trout ♀ × brook trout ♂ which performed better than the brown trout control lot. The use of such hybrids for practical aquaculture would require evidence of superiority at the adult stage and the possibility of improved larval survival.

AB  - SUMMARY 1. Even though intensive aquaculture production of salmonids in lakes occurs in many locations around the world published studies on the survival and reproductive success of escaped cultured salmonids in freshwater ecosystems are not common. A recent expansion of aquaculture in Chile has led it to become the world’s second largest producer of cultured salmonids. 2. We document the recent history of escaped and self-sustaining salmonid populations over a wide spatial scale and a long temporal scale in Chilean Patagonian lakes. Our hypotheses are that salmonid density in lakes will be higher where there is intensive aquaculture, due to greater numbers of potential escapees. Secondly, if non-native salmonids have adverse impacts on native fishes, increases in the abundance of non-native species should be associated with decreases in relative abundance of native species. Finally, if the first two hypotheses are correct we anticipate that diets of salmonids may show evidence of predation on native fishes, diet overlap with native species, and evidence of the influence of feed from aquaculture operations in the diets of salmonids and native fishes. 3. We sampled six lakes with gill nets from 1992 to 2001. Our results show that the relative abundance of free-living salmonids is closely related to the level of fish farming production. Salmonids are the top predators and in lakes with fish farming the main prey item is native fishes. The relative abundance of native fishes has decreased, most likely due to predation by salmonids. 4. Our study contributes to the understanding of the effects of non-native salmonids in oligotrophic lakes, and it provides a starting point to judge the establishment of new fish farming sites in lakes around the world.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an ancient problem, owing to the co-evolution of antibiotic-producing and target organisms in the soil and other environments over millennia. The environmental ‘resistome’ is the collection of all genes that directly or indirectly contribute to antibiotic resistance. Many of these resistance determinants originate in antibiotic-producing organisms (where they serve to mediate self-immunity), while others become resistance determinants only when mobilized and over-expressed in non-native hosts (like plasmid-based β-lactamases). The modern environmental resistome is under selective pressure from human activities such as agriculture, which may influence the composition of the local resistome and lead to gene transfer events. Beyond the environment, we are challenged in the clinic by the rise in both frequency and diversity of antibiotic resistant pathogens. We assume that clinical resistance originated in the environment, but few examples of direct gene exchange between the environmental resistome and the clinical resistome have been documented. Strong evidence exists to suggest that clinical aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamase CTX-M and the quinolone resistance gene Qnr have direct links to the environmental resistome. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from the environment to the clinic. Improvements in sequencing technologies coupled with functional metagenomic studies have revealed previously underappreciated diversity in the environmental resistome, and also established novel genetic links to the clinic. Understanding mechanisms of gene exchange becomes vital in controlling the future dissemination of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Food security is high on the global policy agenda. Demand for food is increasing as populations grow and gain wealth to purchase more varied and resource-intensive diets. There is increased competition for land, water, energy, and other inputs into food production. Climate change poses challenges to agriculture, particularly in developing countries ( 1 ), and many current farming practices damage the environment and are a major source of greenhouse gases (GHG). In an increasingly globalized world, food insecurity in one region can have widespread political and economic ramifications ( 2 ).

AB  - <jats:p>Chiloé is an archipelago that has, since the 1980s, become one of the motors of the Chilean economy. Salmon aquaculture swiftly transformed the tradition of isolation and poverty that had defined the local identity and livelihoods. This is now changing due to the rapid experience of modernity. This modernity is driven by transnational capital and largescale state intervention in the promotion of salmon aquaculture and its current central role in defining development in the islands. While this sector has generated private and public employment and infrastructure, there has also been an important shift in the expectations and aspirations of the local population, towards increased hybridization and also a mercantilization of island culture. The success of salmon production reveals that the conditions of isolation can be transformed, and even benefits reaped from integration into the modern world–globalised, capitalist and rational, rather than traditional– however it also entails risks for the sustainability of fragile socio-ecological systems, including the existence of traditional and alternative livelihoods.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract The global aquaculture sector has grown continuously over the past 40 years, though unevenly among countries. Differences in factors such as inputs, climate, management, technology, markets, social environment, and institutions might be reasons for the disparities in growth. This study focuses on institutions, by analyzing the relationship between annual growth in the production of the major aquaculture countries and the quality of their institutions over three decades (1984–2013). Based on an ex-ante set of criteria, seventy-four aquaculture countries from five different regions - Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania - were selected. Annual percentage change in total aquaculture production, in terms of quantity and value, was used as a proxy for sector development. Three indices - governance, corruption, and competitiveness - were used as institutional quality proxies. Empirical results suggest that the aquaculture growth did not significantly correlate with the quality of institutions. By region, Africa had the fastest growth in the aquaculture sector, though from a low base, with 7.35% and 9.28% higher annual percentage change in aquaculture quantity and value respectively, than the Asian region. While, the European region experienced significantly lower annual percentage change in aquaculture quantity, a difference of 3.78% compared to the Asian region. Furthermore, the study found that total aquaculture production was not positively correlated with eco-label certification. The study is concluded by discussing the “aquaculture paradox.”

AB  - Aquaculture is an extremely valuable and rapidly expanding sector worldwide, but concerns exist related to environmental sustainability. The sediment below aquaculture farms receives inputs of antimicrobials, metal-containing products, and organic matter from uneaten food and fecal material. These inputs impact the surrounding marine microbial communities in complex ways; however, functional diversity shifts related to taxonomic composition remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of pollution from marine fish farms on sediment bacterial communities. We compared the bacterial communities and functional bacterial diversity in surface sediments at salmon aquaculture and reference sites in Chiloe, southern Chile, using Roche 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the predictive metagenomics approach (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States, PICRUSt). Bacterial diversity, measured as the inverse Simpson index, was significantly lower at aquaculture than at reference sites, while species richness, based on Chao’s estimator, was not significantly different. Nevertheless, community composition differed significantly between reference and aquaculture sites. We found that Gammaproteobacteria and several taxa involved in remediating metal contamination and known to have antimicrobial resistances were enriched at aquaculture sites. However, PICRUSt predicted functions indicated a degree of functional redundancy between sites, whereas taxonomic-functional relationships indicated differences in the functional traits of specific taxa at aquaculture sites. This study provides a first step in understanding the bacterial community structure and functional changes due to Chilean salmon aquaculture and has direct implications for using bacterial shifts as indicators of aquaculture perturbations.

AB  - We analyzed spatial, temporal, and age/sex variation in the diet of the South American sea lions (SASL, Otaria byronia) in southern Chile via δ13C and δ15N isotope analysis, with emphasis on exotic farmed and feral salmonids as a source of prey for this generalist predator. Isotope mixing models show that the primary prey consumed by SASL were demersal and benthopelagic fishes. Individuals sampled in summer and in the outer coast had higher δ15N values than those from winter or from the inner coast due to consumption of high trophic level demersal fish. We also found evidence of an ontogenetic shift in isotopic niche width as measured by δ13C and δ15N standard ellipse areas, with juveniles showing a restricted isotopic niche width (1.0‰2) in comparison to subadult (2.2‰2) and adult males (1.9‰2). The proportion of salmonids in the diet of the SASL was negligible and lower than reported in previous studies, which may be related to a recent drop in the production of salmon aquaculture in the region. Our study suggests that the SASL are able to adapt to shifts in spatiotemporal variations in the abundance of potential prey, including feral and farmed salmonids.

AB  - Abstract Artificial hybridizations were carried out with 17 combinations using six species of Salmonidae, namely chinook and coho salmon, rainbow and brown trout, Atlantic salmon and brook trout. Success at the eyed stage, survival rates up to the 15th day after hatching, length of the incubation period and dispersion of hatching times were examined with reference to monospecific control lots. Success and survival rates of hybrids were found to be inferior or at the best similar to those of parental species. Significant maternal effects were observed within most types of crosses. Highly variable interaction factors were found to influence length of incubation of hybrids, which could exceed that of either parental species. The dispersion of hatching times was greater in hybrids than in pure species and tended to be negatively correlated to survival. A few types of hybrids showed promising results at the end of the experiment and their potential interest for aquaculture is discussed.

AB  - Eggs and alevins were collected from 36 redds in the River Vosso in late March 1996. The redds had been made by 20 individual female Atlantic salmon and 12 female brown trout. Species-specific allozyme variation was used to distinguish trout from salmon and egg size and pigment analyses were used to distinguish farmed from wild salmon females. Nine (45%) of the 20 female salmon spawners in the sample were of confirmed farmed origin, because their offspring contained synthetic astaxanthin which is an additive to commercial fish feed. Most of the remaining female salmon were also likely to have been farmed escapees because only about half of the actual farmed spawners can be identified by their astaxanthin content due to intake of carotenoids from natural food sources. The estimated peak spawning for both confirmed and putative farmed females was 32 d earlier than peak spawning of wild females. Egg survival was high and similar to previous estimates for wild and farmed salmon in the River Vosso. Based on the astaxanthin content in sampled eggs and the time of peak spawning it is concluded that most Atlantic salmon fry that hatched in the River Vosso in 1996 were produced by escaped farmed females. The frequency of redds made by farmed females was in accordance with their estimated representation (81%) in the population of spawners during autumn 1995.

AB  - Aquaculture experienced a significant global expansion at the end of the 20th century, becoming one of the fastest growing sectors of animal husbandry and production during that period. Chile's contribution to world expansion of salmon and trout production was notorious, given that in a short twenty five-year period it became one of the leading world producers. One prominent feature of salmon production in Chile is that the industry concentrated geographically in a limited area around Puerto Montt, in Region 10 of the country. Industry concentration cannot be exclusively explained in terms of natural advantages, and evidence is presented in favour of Venables's model (1996). A qualitative analysis of the evolution of the industry is presented to provide evidence of input-output linkages, economies of scale, competition and the progressive multiplication of inputs, applying two types of data sources: a review of the existing technical literature on the subject and in-depth interviews with 20 industry experts.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture was one of the major growing and exporting industries in Chile. Its development was accompanied by an increasing and excessive use of large amounts of antimicrobials, such as quinolones, tetracyclines and florfenicol. The examination of the sanitary conditions in the industry as part of a more general investigation into the uncontrolled and extensive dissemination of the ISA virus epizootic in 2008, found numerous and wide-ranging shortcomings and limitations in management of preventive fish health. There was a growing industrial use of large amounts of antimicrobials as an attempt at prophylaxis of bacterial infections resulting from widespread unsanitary and unhealthy fish rearing conditions. As might be expected, these attempts were unsuccessful and this heavy antimicrobial use failed to prevent viral and parasitic epizootics. Comparative analysis of the amounts of antimicrobials, especially quinolones, consumed in salmon aquaculture and in human medicine in Chile robustly suggests that the most important selective pressure for antibiotic resistant bacteria in the country will be excessive antibiotic use in this industry. This excessive use will facilitate selection of resistant bacteria and resistance genes in water environments. The commonality of antibiotic resistance genes and the mobilome between environmental aquatic bacteria, fish pathogens and pathogens of terrestrial animals and humans suggests that horizontal gene transfer occurs between the resistome of these apparently independent and isolated bacterial populations. Thus, excessive antibiotic use in the marine environment in aquaculture is not innocuous and can potentially negatively affect therapy of bacterial infections of humans and terrestrial animals.

AB  - The current study describes the taxonomic and functional composition of metagenomic sequences obtained from a filamentous microbial mat isolated from the Comau fjord, located in the northernmost part of the Chilean Patagonia. The taxonomic composition of the microbial community showed a high proportion of members of the Gammaproteobacteria, including a high number of sequences that were recruited to the genomes of Moritella marina MP-1 and Colwelliapsycherythraea 34H, suggesting the presence of populations related to these two psychrophilic bacterial species. Functional analysis of the community indicated a high proportion of genes coding for the transport and metabolism of amino acids, as well as in energy production. Among the energy production functions, we found protein-coding genes for sulfate and nitrate reduction, both processes associated with Gammaproteobacteria-related sequences. This report provides the first examination of the taxonomic composition and genetic diversity associated with these conspicuous microbial mat communities and provides a framework for future microbial studies in the Comau fjord.

AB  - <jats:p>In 2014, 129 farmed salmon escapees captured in an upstream-migration trap located in the river Etne, western Norway, were investigated for viral infections, age at escape, size, and genetic composition. The frequency of escapees positive for salmonid alphavirus (SAV), piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), and infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) was 12, 79, and &amp;lt;1%, respectively. Fatty acid analysis demonstrated that the individuals had escaped from farms at different stages of the production cycle, although the majority had probably escaped from farms in the same year as their capture in the river. Genetic analyses demonstrated that the escapees originated from multiple farms. This was also supported by the distribution of fish size and timing of entry into the river. A combination of genetic, fatty acid and viral infection analyses showed that in the river Etne in 2014: (i) most of the fish entering the river were infected with one or more viruses, (ii) the majority of them had escaped in the same year that they entered the river, (ii) they originated from multiple farm sources, and (iv) two of the identified genetic groups likely originated from two recent and distinct escape events. This is the first study to integrate results from multiple analytical methods in order to reveal the ecological and genetic diversity of escaped farmed fish entering a river with native salmon population throughout an entire season.</jats:p>

AB  - In this article, the definition of sustainability is discussed, particularly in relation to the use of marine feed resources. The current review gives an overview of the development of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture and how it has evolved due to changes in legal and management framework conditions. Atlantic salmon production is characterized with high utilization of nutrients, a high yield of production, and a large demand for rendered by-products. All of these factors compare favorably to production of most terrestrial farm animals. Historically, salmon feed has contained fishmeal and fish oil as the primary protein and fat source. Rising demand for feed ingredients has not increased pressure on forage fish resources. Rather, there has been an increased use of plant protein and fat sources. Increased utilization of plant ingredients may not be as sustainable as often claimed. Provided that marine harvest is carried out within legal frames, harvesting the marine ecosystem is a sustainable opera...

AB  - article i nfo In 1990, 90% of the ingredients in Norwegian salmon feed were of marine origin, whereas in 2013 only around 30%. The contents of fish meal and fish oil in the salmon feed were 18% and 11%, respectively, in 2013. Between 2010 and 2013, salmon production in Norway increased by 30%, but due to a lower inclusion of marine ingredientsinthediet,thetotalamountofmarineingredientsusedforsalmonfeedproductionwasreducedfrom 544,000 to 466,000 tonnes. Norwegian salmon farming consumed 1.63 million tonnes of feed ingredients in 2012, containing close to 40 million GJ of energy, 580,000 tonnes of protein and 530,000 tonnes of lipid. 1.26 million tonnes of salmon was produced. Assuming an edible yield of 65%, 820,000 tonnes of salmon fillet, containing 9.44 million GJ, and 156,000 tonnes of protein were produced. The retentions of protein and energy inthe edibleproductin2012were 27% and24%,respectively. Ofthe43,000 tonnes ofEPAand DHAinthesalmon feed in 2012, around 11,000 tonnes were retained in the edible part of salmon. The retentions of EPA and DHA were 46% in whole salmon and 26% in fillets, respectively. The fish in/fish out ratio (FIFO) measures the amount of fish meal and fish oil that is used to produce one weight equivalent of farmed fish back to wild fish weight equiva- lents, and the forage fish dependency ratio (FFDR) is the amount of wild caught fish used to produce the amount of fish meal and fish oil required to produce 1 kg of salmon. From 1990 to 2013, the forage fish dependency ratio for fish meal decreased from 4.4 to 0.7 in Norwegian salmon farming. However, weight-to-weight ratios such as FIFO and FFDR do not account for the different nutrient contents in the salmon product and in the forage fish used for fish meal and fish oil production. Marine nutrient dependency ratios express the amount of marine oil and protein required to produce 1 kg of salmon oil and protein. In 2013, 0.7 kg of marine protein was used to produce 1 kg of salmon protein, so the Norwegian farmed salmon is thus a net producer of marine protein.

AB  - In the face of environmental degradation, animals with limited plasticity are likely to be the most vulnerable.
Habitat selection by the threatened, endemic Chilean dolphin (Cephalorhynchus eutropia) was investigated in the northern Patagonian fjords, an area of extraordinary biological productivity.
Generalized additive models were undertaken to assess the ecological determinants of Chilean dolphin spatial distribution and habitat selection. Data were collected from dedicated fine-scale marine surveys conducted during the austral summer of 2007, 2008 and 2009
Modelling techniques provide strong support for Chilean dolphins aggregating in distinct hotspots, preferring shallow water, near rivers and in areas where the influence of tidal regime is greater.
The preference for coastal shallow waters and river influenced habitats by Chilean dolphins puts them in direct conflict with a growing aquaculture industry and hydropower projects. The models predict areas of high densities of Chilean dolphins and excluding these areas from new developments would provide clear protection to the habitat most important to this poorly known endemic Chilean species.

AB  - We sonically tagged and released farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from a cage site in Cobscook Bay, Maine, USA. The fish were released in January (n = 75) and in April and May (n = 198) 2004 to study their movement patterns and survival and to assess the possibility of recapturing them. Inshore and offshore waters in this region are subject to intense tidal currents. Tagged salmon dispersed >1 km from the cage site within a few hours of their release. Mortality was high within Cobscook Bay and the surrounding coastal region (56% of the winter (January) releases; 84% of the spring (March) releases), probably the result of seal predation. Most surviving fish exited the coastal zone and entered the Bay of Fundy along the routes of the dominant tidal currents, passing through Canadian waters. No tagged fish were detected during the wild salmon spawning season in autumn 2004 in any of the 43 monitored salmon rivers draining into the Bay of Fundy, or during 2005 either in the Magaguadavic River, the site of the hatchery in which the fish were reared to the smolt stage, or by a limited coastal receiver array.

AB  - A study was made of rivers in Northwest Ireland where escapes of adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are known to have occurred from adjacent sea cages. Two markers that showed substantial frequency differences between these farm and wild populations were used: an Ava II-B mtDNA haplotype and allele E at minisatellite locus Ssa-A45/2/1. Farmed populations also showed a significant reduction in mean heterozygosity over the three minisatellite loci examined. Independent occurrence of mtDNA and minisatellite DNA markers in several juvenile samples indicated interbreeding of escaped farm salmon with wild salmon. The proportion of juveniles of maternal farm parentage in two rivers ranged from 18% in 1993 to 2% in 1995 with an average of 7% in both rivers (1993-1995) and a maximum frequency of 70% in an individual sample. Only a small proportion of 29 000 adult farm salmon that escaped in spring 1992 appear to have bred successfully in the rivers studied. Juveniles of farmed parentage survived to at least the 1...

AB  - There are two fundamental ways of doing science: the experimental-predictive and the historical-descriptive. The experimental-predictive approach uses the techniques of controlled experiment, the reduction of natural complexity to a minimal set of general causes, and presupposes that all times can be treated alike and adequately simulated in the laboratory. The historical-descriptive approach uses a mode of analysis which is rooted in the comparative and observational richness of our data, is holistic in its treatment of systems and events, and assumes that the final result being studied is unique, i.e. dependent or contingent upon everything that came before. We suggest that one of the real difficulties we have in understanding ecosystem properties is our inability to deal with scale, and we show how historical science allows us to approach the issue of scale through the interpretation of pattern in time and space. We then use the techniques of the historical-descriptive approach to doing science in the context of our own and other research on climate change and biological production in the North-east Pacific Ocean. In particular, we examine rapid decadal-scale shifts in the abundance and distribution of two major components–salmon and zooplankton - of the large marine ecosystem of the North-east Pacific, and how they relate to similar shifts in North Pacific atmosphere and ocean climate. We conclude that they are all related, and that climate-driven regime shifts, such as those we have identified in the North-east Pacific, can cause major reorganizations of ecological relationships over vast oceanic regions.

AB  - CLIENTS REF. TorbjBrn Einar Asgard NUMBER OF PAGES/APPENOICES .. 30 + Appendices This report presents the carbon footprint and area use of Norwegian farmed salmon that is fed five different diets. It also compares the carbon footprint and occupation of agricultural land of Norwegian farmed salmon from 2010 with Swedish pig and chicken. All results are calculated according to LCA methodology where the functional unit is 1 kg edible product and the system boundaries From fishing/growing oFfeed ingredients and until the products are at the farm gate. Results show that changes in the content of marine ingredients can change the final carbon footprint with ± 7 %. Per kilo edible product a salmon that is Fed the average Norwegian feed diet in 201 D has a carbon footprint of 2.6 kg C02e, it occupies 3J m 2 agricultural land and requires 115 m of sea primary production area. Although only liD % of the diet was of marine origin, the area needed to produce those inputs was much larger than the area used for farming. The comparison with pig and chicken concluded that salmon has the lowest carbon footprint and occupies least agricultural land. Even an almost "vegetarian" salmon can occupy less agricultural land than chicken. Pig had the highest carbon Footprint and the highest occupation of agricultural land.

AB  - ABSTRACTThe importance of aquaculture in the ﬁshery sector is increasing. The growth of aquaculturecomplements the stagnant growth of extractive ﬁsheries. Many countries are now entering thisemerging economic activity. This positive feature has some serious drawbacks when the countryhas no local institutions to ensure the environmental sustainability of aquaculture. The Chileansalmon farming industry has grown dramatically since the mid-1980s to become the leadingexporter of farmed salmon after Norway. The sector, however, suffered decline due to thesanitary crisis in 2007. It is said that this crisis was caused by overexploitation and overconcentra-tion of ﬁsh farms. This paper tries to explain the mechanisms of the sanitary crisis – a ‘tragedy ofthe commons’ – by paying attention to the role of endogenous factors such as local knowledge,capacity building, local ecological conditions and the emergence of local institutions, focusing onthe case of salmon farming in Chile.Key words: Globalisation, environmental sustainability, institution, innovation, ChileINTRODUCTION

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are spatially delimited areas of the marine environment that are managed at least in part, for conservation of biodiversity. The number of MPAs declared worldwide is increasing exponentially Because MPAs can be declared for a variety of reasons, the specific goals of each MPA need to be specified to allow management agencies to assess the success of the MPA, and to guide monitoring and research activities within. Because of the complexity of processes within marine ecosystems, ecological changes associated with the declaration of MPAs vary greatly from one region to another and are difficult to predict accurately. Important factors that affect the way plants and animals respond to MPAs include distribution of habitat types, level of connectivity to nearby fished habitats, wave exposure, depth distribution, prior level of resource extraction, regulations, and level of compliance to regulations. The value of MPAs primarily relates to biodiversity conservation, fisheries, and as research and management tools, but they can also generate recreational, aesthetic and educational benefits. Conservation benefits are evident through increased habitat heterogeneity at the seascape level, increased abundance of threatened species and habitats, and maintenance of a full range of genotypes. Fisheries can benefit through spillover, increased dispersal of egg and larval propagules, and as insurance against stock collapse. Scientific benefits primarily relate to the use of MPAs as reference areas to assess the scale of human impacts on the environment, and as locations for the collection of data that are unobtainable in fished systems. Nevertheless, MPAs can also involve costs to human society through displaced fishing effort, short-term reductions in catches, false security, and through undesirable interactions within the biota. MPAs do not represent the universal panacea for all threats affecting marine ecosystems, but can be regarded as arguably the most important tool in the marine manager's toolbox.

AB  - Scottish aquaculture production is a pillar of rural industry in Scotland, and provides considerable
benefit for fragile economic areas. Further, through its supply chain providing demand for feed,
research, engineering, and downstream logistics and processing opportunities, it provides
employment and revenue for a diverse range of sectors throughout Scotland. This assessment,
commissioned by Marine Scotland and Highlands and Islands Enterprise between July-December
2013, describes these benefits through the industry’s economic contribution including social,
environmental, human, financial and physical capital. 
Analysis was split into four work packages: a macro-level industry assessment; a Market Systems
Approach analysing the whole market; a Sustainable Livelihoods Approach using a combination of
interviews and questionnaires to investigate sustainability and benefits to communities; and a Value
Matrix to summarise all available benefits provided by the aquaculture industry.
